<p>A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.</p>

<h2 id="toc2"><span>Tool Proficiencies</span></h2>
<p>Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything</p>
<p>Tool proficiencies are a useful way to highlight a character's background and talents. At the game table, though, the use of tools sometimes overlaps with the use of skills, and it can be unclear how to use them together in certain situations. This section offers various ways that tools can be used in the game.</p>
<h3 id="toc3"><span>Tools and Skills Together</span></h3>
<p>Tools have more specific applications than skills. The History skill applies to any event in the past. A tool such as a forgery kit is used to make fake objects and little else. Thus, why would a character who has the opportunity to acquire one or the other want to gain a tool proficiency instead of proficiency in a skill?</p>
<p>To make tool proficiencies more attractive choices for the characters, you can use the methods outlined below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Advantage.</em></strong> If the use of a tool and the use of a skill both apply to a check, and a character is proficient with the tool and the skill, consider allowing the character to make the check with advantage. This simple benefit can go a long way toward encouraging players to pick up tool proficiencies. In the tool descriptions that follow, this benefit is often expressed as additional insight (or something similar), which translates into an increased chance that the check will be a success.</p>
<p><strong><em>Added Benefit.</em></strong> In addition, consider giving characters who have both a relevant skill and a relevant tool proficiency an added benefit on a successful check. This benefit might be in the form of more detailed information or could simulate the effect of a different sort of successful check. For example, a character proficient with mason's tools makes a successful Wisdom (Perception) check to find a secret door in a stone wall. Not only does the character notice the door's presence, but you decide that the tool proficiency entitles the character to an automatic success on an Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine how to open the door.</p>
<h3 id="toc4"><span>XGE Tool Descriptions</span></h3>
<p>The following sections go into detail about the tools presented in the Player's Handbook, offering advice on how to use them in a campaign.</p>
<p><strong><em>Components.</em></strong> The first paragraph in each description gives details on what a set of supplies or tools is made up of. A character who is proficient with a tool knows how to use all of its component parts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Skills.</em></strong> Every tool potentially provides advantage on a check when used in conjunction with certain skills, provided a character is proficient with the tool and the skill. As DM, you can allow a character to make a check using the indicated skill with advantage. Paragraphs that begin with skill names discuss these possibilities. In each of these paragraphs, the benefits apply only to someone who has proficiency with the tool, not someone who simply owns it.</p>
<p>With respect to skills, the system is mildly abstract in terms of what a tool proficiency represents; essentially, it assumes that a character who has proficiency with a tool also has learned about facets of the trade or profession that are not necessarily associated with the use of the tool.</p>
<p>In addition, you can consider giving a character extra information or an added benefit on a skill check. The text provides some examples and ideas when this opportunity is relevant.</p>
<p><strong><em>Special Use.</em></strong> Proficiency with a tool usually brings with it a particular benefit in the form of a special use, as described in this paragraph.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sample DCs.</em></strong> A table at the end of each section lists activities that a tool can be used to perform, and suggested DCs for the necessary ability checks.</p>
