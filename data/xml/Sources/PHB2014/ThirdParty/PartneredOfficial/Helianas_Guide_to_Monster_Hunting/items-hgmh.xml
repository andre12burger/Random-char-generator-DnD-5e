    <text>Within this sturdy, corrosion-resistant polyhedron is a phial of polyhedrooze ooze; a caustic substance with remarkable powers of biological alteration.

Caustic Calamity: As an action, you can press a button on the polyhedron, crushing the phial, and then toss the device up to 60 feet away. The resulting chemical reaction produces an explosion of acid in a 20-foot radius. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, the reaction produces unpredictable biomantic effects on a failed saving throw. Roll a d10 and consult the table below to determine the effect. If a creature comes under an effect lasting 1 minute, it can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Polyhedron Effects:
d10 | Effect
1 | The acid stops regeneration and healing. The creature can't regain hit points for 1 minute.
2 | The acid coats creatures, dissolving them. The creature takes 2d6 acid damage at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute.
3 | Parts of creatures' bodies meld together. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls for 1 minute.
4 | The acid fuses feet and footwear to the ground. The creature is restrained until the end of your next turn.
5 | The acid fuses the eyelids shut. The creature is blinded until the end of your next turn.
6 | The acid causes creatures' skin to become phosphorescent. The creature is under the effect of the faerie fire spell for 1 minute.
7 | The acid causes growths to appear and disappear on creatures' bodies, hindering their actions. The creature is under the effect of the bane spell for 1 minute.
8 | The acid causes creatures to shrink. The creature is under the reduce effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1 minute.
9 | The acid fuses mouths shut. The creature is under the effect of the zippit!* spell for 1 minute.
10 | Roll twice on the table, rerolling any further 10s and duplicate results.

Once this property of the item has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn and a new phial of polyhedrooze ooze has been installed in the device.

Trigger Warning: Instead of throwing the bomb, you can use an action to plant it on a surface and set it to detonate in a specific situation. As an action, a creature can disarm a bomb set to explode in this way with a successful DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a failed check, the bomb goes off and the creature that made the check automatically fails the saving throw. Choose one of the following detonation options:

	• Proximity Trigger: Choose a range between 0 and 20 feet. The first Small or larger creature to move within that distance of the bomb after you leave the area sets it off. A creature that succeeds on a DC 16 Dexterity (Stealth) check can approach the bomb without triggering it.

	• Time Bomb: Choose an amount of time ranging from 1 to 100 rounds. On initiative count 20 of the round you choose, the bomb explodes.

    <detail>rare</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Filled with a caustic mixture that discharges when stepped on, these tetrahedral caltrops present a much more dangerous hazard than their mundane variety. A typical bag of these 1-inch health and safety nightmares contains 20 caltroozes. Small bubbles of acid forming and bursting inside the caltroozes cause them to roll and shift.

Caltrops: As an action, you can spread a single bag of caltroozes to cover a 5-foot square. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature that moves through the area of the caltroozes at half speed makes the saving throw against them with advantage.

Corrosive Chaos: If a creature fails the Dexterity saving throw, roll a d4 and consult the table below to determine what additional effects take place:

Corrosive Chaos Table:
d4 | Effect
1 | The acid in the caltroozes discharges in a single burst. The creature takes an additional 6d6 acid damage.
2 | The acid takes on lubricating qualities. While the creature's speed is reduced by the caltroozes, it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns or fall prone.
3 | The acid coats the creature's feet, continuously eating away at them. While the creature's speed is reduced by the caltroozes, it takes 1d4 acid damage for every 5 feet it walks or climbs.
4| The acid causes a creature's feet to temporarily deform. While the creature's speed is reduced by the caltroozes, it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

After a creature fails a saving throw against the caltroozes, they are emptied of acid, and you can't use this property again until you spend 10 minutes decanting a phial of biomantic acid into all the caltrops. The caltroozes can still be used as regular caltrops that deal magical piercing damage.

Sticky Fingers: When you hit a Medium or smaller creature that is holding a weapon or item with an attack using the flooze, you can choose to disarm it of one weapon instead of dealing damage to it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or let go of its item, which becomes stuck in the flail. A creature within reach of the flooze can use an action to make a DC 16 Strength check, liberating the stuck weapon on a success. Success or failure, a creature takes 1d4 acid damage when it takes this action. The flail can only hold 2 weapons at a time, and a nonmagical weapon that remains in the flail for 1 minute is completely dissolved. While the flail has weapons in it, you can choose to deal your choice of piercing or slashing damage with it on each hit, instead of the usual bludgeoning damage.

Summon Ooze: While holding the skull, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and call forth the ooze that lives within. It expands into its normal Large size in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The ooze uses the saddle slime stat block and returns to the skull when it drops to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. If the ooze is reduced to 0 hit points, it can't be summoned again for 1 hour. The ooze is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

    <text>A magically-refilling reservoir of ooze is contained within this icosahedral helmet. Two chemicals are distilled from the ooze, piped through the tubes, and mixed together into an oxygen analogue, allowing its wearer to breathe in otherwise impossible conditions.

Breathe Easy: While wearing this helmet, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors that you inhale (such as the stinking cloud effect, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons, but not contact toxins like cloudkill).

Biomantic Overload: While wearing this helmet, you can use a bonus action to ingest the chemicals in it before they are combined into a gas, causing your body to go into a mutated state of enhanced adaptability for 1 minute. During this time, immediately after you take damage from any source, you gain resistance to that damage type. This resistance lasts until you take damage of another type (at which point you gain resistance to that new damage type) or until the effect ends. If you take damage of multiple types simultaneously, the damage type to which you become resistant is determined randomly (GM's discretion). Once this property of the helmet has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

While wearing the ring, whenever you touch a plant or surface made of wood, you can expend 1 charge to cause an eye to grow anywhere along that plant/surface within 60 feet of you. You can see out of the eye, which has darkvision out to 60 feet, for as long as you remain touching the plant/surface. While you look out of the eye, you are blinded with regards to your own senses.
	The eye has a Dexterity (Stealth) modifier of +8. It has AC 10 and 5 hit points. Any damage dealt to the eye is transferred back to you as psychic damage.

Optional Attunement: While you are attuned to the ring, it gains the Eyesoar property.

Eyesoar: If you stop touching the wood in which you have grown an eye, the eye persists for one hour or until you create a new eye. So long as the eye is within 300 feet of you, you can use an action to look through the eye. While looking through the eye you can, as an action, move the eye up to 30 feet along the wood.

Bloodbend: As an action, you can expend 1 charge as you gesture to a creature you can see within 30 feet of you and speak a one-word command. If the target has blood, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or instantly use its reaction to follow the command (GM's discretion). If the creature has no reaction remaining, it must use its reaction to follow the command the next time it regains it. The property has no effect on a target that doesn't have blood.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>From the horn and eyes of a magnetite dragon is crafted this crown of magnetite. The creature's commanding presence and power over the blood of others allow the wearer of this object to bend its foes to its will.
	Critical hits against you made with ferrous weapons or ammunition become normal hits while you wear this crown. In addition, while wearing this crown, you know the magnetobolt cantrip (+8 to hit or your spellcasting attack modifier, whichever is higher) and, in extreme cold, you can cast the levitate spell on yourself at will.
	The crown has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.
	While you wear this crown in extreme cold, you can cast the fly spell on yourself at will.

Bloodbend: As an action, you can expend 1 charge as you gesture to a creature you can see within 30 feet of you and speak a one-word command. If the target has blood, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or instantly use its reaction to follow the command (GM's discretion). If the creature has no reaction remaining, it must use its reaction to follow the command the next time it regains it. The property has no effect on a target that doesn't have blood. Commands include:

	• Throw: The creature throws an object it is holding in a direction you choose with all its might.

	• Sit: The creature sits, falling prone and not moving until the end of its next turn.

	• Attack: The creature makes one weapon attack against a creature of your choice within its reach/range.

Magnetovision: As a bonus action, you can spend 1 charge allowing you to sense the locations of all ferrous metals within 60 feet of you for the next 10 minutes. This vision is blocked by a thin sheet of lead.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Within the beautifully sculpted exterior is housed a dragon's biomantically-sustained toxin gland, pungent incense, and crushed diamond. Available in a variety of hues, the metal of this grenade-like contraption matches the dragon from which the organ was harvested.
	As an action, you can throw this magical device onto a surface you can see within 60 feet. Upon impact, the incense ignites, billowing out in a pungent, 15-foot-radius sphere, carrying with it the dragon's magic. A creature that starts its turn in the area or enters the area for the first time on its turn must make the associated saving throw, suffering the associated effects on a failure. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe. The cloud lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it.
	Once a grenade has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn, and it must be refilled with 100 gp of good-quality incense, as well as a specified value of diamond dust.

Brass, Sleep; Very rare: A creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be affected by a heavy drowsiness that causes it to fall unconscious until the start of its next turn. A creature with 80 or more hit points is immune to this effect. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage, or if another creature uses an action to wake it. Diamond dust: 600 gp.

Bronze, Repulsion; Rare: A creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be flung up to 60 feet from the centre of the sphere, landing prone and taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage. If a creature collides with another creature, both creatures take an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage. If a creature collides with a solid object, it takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage instead. Diamond dust: 400 gp.

Copper, Slow; Rare: A creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effects of the slow spell until the start of its next turn. Diamond dust: 300 gp.

Gold, Weakening; Very rare: A creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and also deal half damage with Strength-based attacks until the end of its next turn. Diamond dust: 1200 gp.

Silver, Paralysing; Legendary: A creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralysed until the start of its next turn. Diamond dust: 2400 gp.

	The skull contains 7 petals. While holding it, you can use an action to pluck a petal to cast the guiding bolt spell (+5 to hit), dealing necrotic damage instead of radiant. The skull regrows 1d4 plucked petals daily at dawn. If you pluck the last petal, the skull crumbles to dust and is destroyed.

Curse: This skull is cursed, and plucking 3 or more petals in a day extends this curse to you. Until the curse is broken with remove curse or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the skull, keeping it within reach at all times.
	While cursed, whenever you finish a long rest, a black petal grows on your head. These black petals cannot be removed physically, and any attempt to do so causes you to take 2d6 necrotic damage.
	If you travel to a different plane while cursed, you grow a further 1d4 black petals.
	When the seventh petal has grown on your skull, you die and your body turns to dust, except for your skull, which becomes a new infested cultist's skull. If the curse is removed, the petals on your head and the infested cultist's skull are destroyed and crumble to dust.

When grasped with force, the long, narrow blade extends, increasing the reach of its wielder's thrust, and can implant a rapidly-growing net of hyphal tethers that can bind and constrict a foe.

Hyphal Stretch: On your turn, you can squeeze the longspike (no action required), causing it to lengthen and increasing the reach of melee attacks you make with it by 5 feet until the end of your turn.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to this weapon, causing it to gain the Hyphal Grasp property while you remain attuned to it.

OA: Hyphal Grasp: As a bonus action while holding the rapier, you can speak its command word to cause writhing hyphal filaments to grow from it. The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack using longspike within the next minute, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the magical hyphae for 1 minute. An affected creature can use an action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. After you activate this property, roll a d6. On a 1-2 you can't activate this property again until the following dawn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Detritivore: As a bonus action, you can target one Small or larger corpse, or one Small or larger creature with 0 hit points you can see within 15 feet of you, causing your mycelia to burrow over to it and rapidly drain it of nutrients. If the target is alive, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fail a death saving throw. Undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failure, or if the target is a corpse, you regain 6d6 hit points. After you activate this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Mycelial Deconstruction: As an action, you can wrap the cloak around yourself, causing your body, and all the items you are wearing or holding, to dissolve into thousands of mycelial threads. You gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed, you can burrow through nonmagical unworked earth and stone, and you don't disturb the material you move through.
	While in this form, you can pass through any microscopic gap large enough for a fungal hypha; have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; and can't talk, manipulate objects, cast spells, or attack.

Vines and Thorns: While attuned to this shield, you can use an action to animate one of the shield's thorny vines and make a melee weapon attack (+5 to hit) against one target within 30 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 piercing damage, and, if the target is a Large or smaller creature, or an object that weighs less than 500 pounds, you pull it up to 10 feet closer to you.

    <text>Parasite or symbiote, the exact classification of this loop of living fungus is up for debate. When worn for an extended period, the ring co-opts its host, producing an assortment of fruiting fungal bodies each day. Whether those are of benefit or not is entirely up to how they're used.
	Whenever you finish a long rest during which you wear this ring, you find a selection of toadstools has grown on the limb that sports this ring. Roll a d4 twice and consult the list below to determine which two mushrooms have grown.

1-Boomshroom: As an action, a creature can throw this volatile mushroom at a point it can see within 60 feet of it, where it explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere of flames. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

2-Bloomshroom: As an action, a creature can eat this mushroom, regaining 2d4 + 2 hit points and gaining advantage on all Constitution saving throws for 1 minute.

3-Doomshroom: As an action, a creature can throw this dusky mushroom at a point it can see within 60 feet of it, where it explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere of purple spores. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become afflicted by the bane spell for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

4-Gloomshroom: As an action, a creature can eat this mushroom. For the next hour, it gains darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If it already has darkvision, the range of this vision is increased by 30 feet.

The mushrooms last on your arm until you finish a long rest, but lose all magical effects 10 minutes after they are plucked. You can pluck a mushroom as part of the action to use it.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to this item. While attuned, you can roll the d4 to determine which mushrooms grew four times instead of twice.

	• 1. Boomshroom: As an action, a creature can throw this volatile mushroom at a point it can see within 60 feet of it, where it explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere of flames. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

	• 2. Bloomshroom: As an action, a creature can eat this mushroom, regaining 2d4 + 2 hit points and gaining advantage on all Constitution saving throws for 1 minute.

	• 3. Doomshroom: As an action, a creature can throw this dusky mushroom at a point it can see within 60 feet of it, where it explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere of purple spores. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become afflicted by the bane spell for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

	• 4. Gloomshroom: As an action, a creature can eat this mushroom. For the next hour, it gains darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If it already has darkvision, the range of this vision is increased by 30 feet.

	• 5. Rheumshroom: As an action, a creature can throw this sticky mushroom at a point it can see within 60 feet of it, where it explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere of arthritis-inducing spores. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effects of the slow spell for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

	• 6. Zoomshroom: As an action, a creature can eat this mushroom, gaining the benefits of the haste spell for 1 minute. At the start of each of the affected creature's turns, roll a d6. On a 1, the effect ends and the wave of lethargy described in the spell sweeps over it.

The mushrooms last on your arm until you finish a long rest, but lose all magical effects 10 minutes after they are plucked. You can pluck a mushroom as part of the action to use it.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to this item. While attuned, you can roll the d6 to determine which mushrooms grew four times instead of twice. While a creature is attuned to the ring, it gains the Fungal Plating property.

OA: Fungal Plating: When you finish a long rest while wearing the ring, hard sheets of organic mycoprotein cover your body. You gain the benefits of the barkskin spell for the next 24 hours (no concentration required). While this magical effect persists, you gain 5 temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns.

    <text>This thick, rubbery overcoat sports several writhing tentacles that can biomantically fuse with their wearer, acting as gills, propulsion, and a formidable, concealed weapon. When in danger, the coat can encapsulate you in a protective chrysalis, nourishing you with stored regenerative mucous.
	While wearing the coat underwater, tentacles wrap around your throat, fusing with your vascular system and allowing you to breathe underwater. The tentacles also propel you, giving you a swimming speed of 40 feet.

Tentacle Lash: As an action, you can make a melee spell attack (+7 to hit) against a creature within 10 feet of you. On a hit, the creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage, and, if it is Medium or smaller, must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

Chrysalis: You can use an action to cause the coat to expand and harden, encasing you in a regenerative, chitinous casing which grants you 20 temporary hit points. While encased, your speed is reduced to 0 feet, you can't take actions or reactions (except the action to emerge from the chrysalis), and you regain 2d6 hit points at the start of each of your turns. You can regain no more than 30 hit points in this way while encased. These effects end when the temporary hit points are lost, after 1 minute, or when you decide to emerge from the chrysalis as an action, whichever comes first. After you activate this property, you can't do so again until the next dawn.

	"Upin Enterprises accepts no responsibility for enslavement caused by accidental generation of new aboleths caused by this item."

This magic item can hold a maximum of 10 charges. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can expend any number of Hit Dice to charge the broodslinger. For each Hit Die spent in this way, roll each die and add your Constitution modifier. The broodslinger regains a number of charges equal to the total.

Spikes: Your unarmed strikes deal 1 additional piercing damage on a hit.

Mucous Spit: As an action, you can cause the broodslinger to spit a globule of acidic mucous at a target within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack (+5 to hit). On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage. You can expend charges immediately before making the attack roll to enhance the mucous in the following way (no action required):

	• Splashing Mucous (1 Charge): Hit or miss, acid splashes onto adjacent creatures. The target, and each creature within 5 feet of the target, must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 acid damage.

Shrouded Spells: In a similar manner, you can spend 10 minutes attempting to cast one of the following spells, requiring no material components and without expending a spell slot. At the end of the 10 minutes, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 plus the spell's level. On a success, you cast the spell. On a failure, you don't cast the spell and you take psychic damage equal to twice the spell's level.

As an action, you can unfasten the clasp and throw the luggage at a point you can see within 30 feet of you, where it instantly opens, spewing squirming ebony tentacles in a 20-foot square. This area becomes affected by the black tentacles spell for 1 minute (no concentration required). If you are attuned to the luggage, you are immune to this spell's effects.

If you are attuned to the luggage, you can attempt to direct the portal to a specific location, as per the teleport spell.

A creature wearing these robes can become temporarily incorporeal, slipping through locked doors, blood-thirsty demons, or out of uncomfortable conversations. Owners of such a garment also find themselves incredibly productive, with dishes cleaned and chainmail oiled each morning...
	Also, it has pockets.
	This robe has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Incorporeality: As a bonus action, you can spend 1 charge to become incorporeal until the start of your next turn. While incorporeal, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside a creature or object, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you are shunted.

Spellcasting: You can spend charges to cast the following spells (save DC 15). You must spend a number of charges equal to the level at which you cast the spell.

	• Daydream
	• Sleep
	• Dreamwalk

Sleepwalker: You can't be put to sleep against your will. When you fall into a nonmagical sleep while wearing these robes, you can specify one intention, such as 'organizing my collection of buttons' or 'oiling my chainmail'. While you sleep, you can perform light activities that fulfill this intention while still meeting the requirements of a long rest.

If you end your turn inside a creature or object, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you are shunted.

Spellcasting: You can spend charges to cast the following spells (save DC 17). You must spend a number of charges equal to the level at which you cast the spell.

	• Daydream
	• Sleep
	• Dreamwalk
	• Dream
	• Astral Projection

Sleepwalker: You can't be put to sleep against your will. When you fall into a nonmagical sleep while wearing these robes, you can specify one intention, such as 'organizing my collection of buttons' or 'oiling my chainmail'. While you sleep, you can perform light activities that fulfill this intention while still meeting the requirements of a long rest.

Language of the Anomalies: While you wear these robes, you can speak, read, and write Deep Speech, and have advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with aberrations.

	As a bonus action, immediately before you make an ability check or attack roll, you can activate the stopwatch, setting a call-back marker. After you make the ability check or attack roll (and after you know the outcome), you can choose to rewind time by a few seconds to the moment you took the bonus action (no action required). You must then reroll the ability check or attack roll and use the new result. Whether or not you choose to rewind to the callback marker, after you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>A claw is a simple, bladed melee weapon worn as a glove.

Special: Attached. You can't be disarmed of this weapon, but donning or doffing the weapon takes an action. You can use a hand equipped with a claw to hold items, but can't attack with the claw while doing so. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls using other weapons held in your clawed hand.

These rough, menacing gauntlets, constructed from the razor-sharp claws of the pygmy rakshasa, thrum with the power of its hellish essence. The pointed tips of the claws easily dig into rock and metal alike, letting their wearer climb the roughest surfaces with feline agility.
	The claws have 4 charges and regain all expended charges daily at dawn.

Rakshasa's Corruption: Blows from this weapon can cause a target's magical energy to turn foul and consume it from within. When you hit a creature with an attack using one of these claws, you can spend 1 charge to attempt to curse it (no action required). The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be cursed for 1 minute. When a cursed creature starts its turn while under the effect of a spell or while concentrating on a spell, it takes 1d6 necrotic damage.

Catclimb: While wearing a pair of these claws, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

	The ring has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Arcane Interference: While wearing the ring, whenever you are the target of a spell or make a saving throw against a spell's area of effect, you can use your reaction to tug at the Weave, consuming 1 charge and attempting to unravel the spell's magic. If the spell is of 2nd level or lower, roll a d4 and consult the table below to determine the effect, which occurs immediately before the spell's effect. If the spell is 3rd level or higher, this property has no effect.

Arcane Interference:
d4 | Effects
1 | The caster of the spell must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, taking force damage equal to 1d6 plus an additional 1d6 for each level of the spell on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
2 | The spell's potency is diminished. If the spell requires an attack roll, the roll is made with disadvantage. If it requires you to make a saving throw, you have advantage on it.
3 | You absorb a portion of the spell's energy, gaining temporary hit points equal to 1d6 plus an additional 1d6 for each level of the spell. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.
4 | You are unaffected by the spell.

    <text>Weighing approximately 10 pounds, this 1-foot-cubed turret is bristling with armaments. From its crudely chiselled 'bitey-bit', to the side-mounted 'kannon-boom', and the fore-mounted 'spikeys', this magically-automated turret has but one key flaw: stairs.

Deploy: As an action, you can deploy the rolly turrit, which magically animates for the next 10 minutes. During this time, it is under your mental control while within 100 feet of you. In combat, the turret shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the turret can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
	Once the turret has been activated, it can't be activated again until the following dawn.

Death &amp; Healing: While the turret has at least 1 hit point, it regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it. If the turret is reduced to 0 hit points, it shatters and can't be activated again until a creature with proficiency in smith's tools or tinker's tools spends 1 hour to make a DC 16 Dexterity (smith's or tinker's tools) check. On a success, the turret regains 1 hit point and can be activated as normal.

    <text>The dimensional doorknob is a must-have addition to the arsenal of any thief that lacks the necessary dexterity to pick locks themselves. In addition, the doorknob's built-in escape magic allows for a quick getaway when things go south. As a guard wanders a museum of precious relics, the bowels of a jail, or the vault of a treasury, they might find only unlocked doors and a momentary glowing purple light as a thief teleports from the scene of its crime.

Skeleton Key: As an action, you can place the doorknob over a keyhole where, for the next minute, it attempts to pick the lock. The dimensional doorknob acts as a set of thieves' tools and automatically unlocks locks with a DC of 15 or lower. For higher difficulty locks, the doorknob has a +7 modifier to its Dexterity (thieves' tools) check.

Dortal: As an action while holding the doorknob, you can cast the dimension door spell. When you do so, a glowing purple portal appears in your space until the start of your next turn. Any creature up to 1 size larger than you can pass through the portal. After you activate this property, you can't do so again until the following dawn.

This pocket dimension is a 10-foot cube containing a forge that, due to the insulating properties of pocket dimensions, never cools. It's perfect for getting rid of trash, destroying incriminating evidence, or smelting down looted weapons.

Gnash: When a creature misses you with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw as the shield chomps at their weapon with its fiery maw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 fire damage as the shield breathes a plume of scalding air at them. In addition, if the creature's weapon is nonmagical, then any flammable components, such as those made of wood, are destroyed.

	Worn like a backpack or satchel, this patchwork vessel of scrap metal can hold a maximum of 12 charges. Over the course of an hour, you can feed one of the following fuel options into the backpack, causing it to regain expended charges depending on the fuel's quality:

	• 1 sp of seasoned wood: 1d4 charges.
	• 5 gp of high-quality coal or oil: 1d4 + 3 charges.
	• Elemental core of fire, or breath sac of a red, gold, or brass dragon: all expended charges.

Dragon's Breath: While holding the flaymefrower's maw, you can use an action to speak one of the flaymefrower's two command words, expending 1 charge and causing it to spout a gout of flame in a 10-foot cone or a 5-foot-wide, 20-foot-long line (your choice). As part of the same action, you can squeeze the maw, injecting more fuel and spending up to 3 additional charges. The size of the cone increases by 5 feet or the length of the line increases by 20 feet, for each additional charge expended.
	Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

Backfire: When you use Dragon's Breath and roll a total of 19 or higher on the fire damage dice, the flaymefrower backfires. Each creature within 10 feet of you (including you) must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 fire damage as gouts of flame burst from the make-shift hose.

	Kobold ingenuity is excellent, but the execution can be somewhat lacking. Luckily, the original prototype of this flame-filled backpack has undergone some extensive upgrades; it now boasts a nigh-on indestructible braided brass hose and can burn much hotter.

Coldfire Flame: As a bonus action, you can twist the dragon's maw 180 degrees, causing the flame to burn blue and deal cold damage instead of fire damage. This change lasts until you use a bonus action to turn it back.

    <text>Ammo: crossbow bolt

Something about this cobbled-together, wrist-mounted, bow-like contraption looks wrong. It shouldn't hold together. There's nothing even holding the string in place. It must be magic. There's no writing on it but, if there was, you feel it'd be written as: "Kobbold RystBo."

Handsfree: The kobold wristbow does not require a free hand to hold or fire.

Quickshot: In response to your mental command, you can release the bowstring and make a ranged weapon attack with the loaded wristbow as a bonus action. You must reload a wristbow before firing again.

Reload: You can reload the kobold wristbow using either a bonus action or an action. This requires at least 1 free hand.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Metal can't be corroded by acid and wood &amp; clothing cease being flammable. Strong magic, such as that from a 6th-level spell or higher, can overcome this enhanced resilience. If socketed on a weapon, that weapon's damage becomes magical. If socketed on armour, the oil lubricates the joints, removing any disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks the armour normally imposes.

In the same way the oil refracts light in rainbow hues, the cloth has a natural resistance to magic, occasionally sending spells ricocheting back at the caster.

Oily Barrage: While you wear this robe, you can cast a variety of oil-based spells. This robe has 7 charges and regains 1d6 + 1 charges daily at dawn. You can expend charges to cast the following spells (save DC 15, +7 to hit). Some spells are changed to be oil-based.

	• Grease (1 charge)
	• Create or destroy oil (2 charges; as create or destroy water, but oil instead of water)
	• Mireball* (3 charges; instead of mud, thick, rancid fat and oil are conjured)

Spell Reflection: While you wear this robe, any time you are targeted by a magic missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d8. On a 1-7, you are affected as normal. On an 8, you are unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from you, turning the caster into the target.

    <text>Fossilised bones and oilcloth, a lipid-rich mesh of viscous crude oil and lipophilic fibres, forms the basis of this magical robe. In the same way the oil refracts light in rainbow hues, the cloth has a natural resistance to magic, occasionally sending spells ricocheting back at the caster.
	While you wear the robe you can speak and understand Terran.

Oily Barrage: While you wear this robe, you can cast a variety of oil-based spells. This robe has 12 charges and regains 1d8 + 4 charges daily at dawn. You can expend charges to cast the following spells (save DC 15, +7 to hit). Some spells are changed to be oil-based.

	• Grease (1 charge)
	• Create or destroy oil (2 charges; as create or destroy water, but oil instead of water)
	• Mireball* (3 charges; instead of mud, thick, rancid fat and oil are conjured)
	• Bone Cage (5 charges)
	• Conjure Elemental (5 charges; tar elemental only)

Spell Reflection: While you wear this robe, any time you are targeted by a magic missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d8. On a 1-6, you are affected as normal. On a 7 or 8, you are unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from you, turning the caster into the target.

    <text>With the sentient tar of a tar elemental and a dose of enchantment magic, one can craft this friendly and amenable little helper. When applied to anything you can hold, the tinytar ensures you don't accidentally drop it.

Grippy: This small, magical phial contains an animate and excitable tar. When applied to the handle of a weapon, shield or other held item, the first creature to hold that item can't be disarmed of the item against its will. The creature can still sheathe or drop the item if it desires; the tinytar is very intuitive. As an action, you can hold the magical phial to the tinytar causing it to shlink back inside.

    <text>While unworn, this item appears as a puddle of viscous tar and bone shards. When you attune to this amorphous ooze, it slides up your arms, enhancing them with an extra-cutaneous layer of malleable, oily muscle.

Armhancements: While attuned to this item, whenever you make an ability check that uses Strength, you can treat a d20 roll of 7 or lower as an 8.

Malleable Skin: When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.

Claws: Protruding from your tar-coated hands are long claws; natural weapons which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 2d4 + your Strength modifier instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

Mask: This oily symbiote can react to danger, enhancing your senses. As a reaction when initiative is rolled, you can command the oil to cover your face for the next minute. For the duration, you have advantage on initiative checks and Dexterity saving throws, and gain blindsight out to 30 feet. After you activate this ability, you can't do so again until the following dawn.

Reactive Tentacles: Your symbiote protects you from incoming blows. Whenever you are the target of a melee attack by an attacker you can see within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack (+9 to hit) against that attacker immediately after its attack concludes. This attack deals 2d8 piercing damage on a hit.

    <text>Firm, and always slightly moist to the touch, this pair of eyes wanders of their own accord. When placed on a single object that can fit inside a 5-foot cube, the object becomes sentient. It can't speak, and has statistics the GM deems appropriate.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>There's an old adage: "If you can't stand the heat, get the hell out of the kitchen. If you can stand the heat, make the kitchen portable and take it wherever you go!" To accompany the launch of her book, Heliana commissioned the ever-useful artificer, L'Arsène Upin, to produce a line of portable kitchen backpacks. In addition to improving flavour and nutritional value, the pockets of these grill-backpacks always contain the cumin, shallots, or other ingredients that you forgot to pack. Nice!

Extra-Dimensional Pantry: One pocket of this grill-backpack is a gateway to a pocket dimension that magically refills with sustenance at dawn each day. It has enough vegetables and sundries for one magical meal or for a day's rations for one creature. The nature of the food that a creature extracts from the pocket dimension is always a reflection of what the creature desires at that moment. The pocket only allows items to be taken from it; any attempt to put something into this pocket results in the item being fired back out.

Sous-Chef: The grill's inbuilt cooking monitor adjusts its own temperature to improve the end result of foods cooked with it. When you cook a magical meal using this grill, it gains one additional boon from the Cooking Boons table at random (page 148).

Tools for the Job: The grill of barbecuing comes with all the paraphernalia needed for cooking and acts as cook's utensils.

    <text>Full of useful knowledge and heavy enough to crush a skull, Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting is nothing if not handy. The personalised quotes from Heliana, Peeper's deft proofing and editing, and the numerous ink stains and spilled watercolours give this hefty tome a homemade feel.

Fantastic Phalanges and Where to Find Them: As an action, you can open this book and stare intently at its pages, which turn of their own accord to settle on an anatomical diagram of the corpse nearest to the book. You immediately learn all the harvestable parts of the corpse, as well as their Component DCs.

Know Thy Enemy: As an action, you can place an object that belonged to a creature—such as its scat, scales, or clothing—between the pages of this book. One minute later, the book tells you one piece of information about the creature. At the GM's discretion, this may be: its saving throw proficiencies, damage resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities; condition immunities; creature's type; one of its traits; or one of the clues acquired during a hunt. Placing more objects that belonged to that creature (or a creature with the same statblock) yields no further results.

Weapon of the Learned: This book can be used as a simple melee weapon that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If you are proficient in Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion, you are proficient with this weapon.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Expecting a flood of adventurers to buy Heliana's book and begin crafting their own magic items —potentially putting him out of a job!—L'Arsène devised a way he might profit from the book's popularity. With a series of articulating lenses that filter out threads belonging to different schools of magic, L'Arsène's Quadnoculars grant their wearer the ability to identify the magic items that could be constructed from a recently slain creature. After all, it's not much use knowing what you can harvest without knowing how you can use it.

Spectacular Analytica: As an action, you can flick through the filters of these goggles and stare intently at a corpse within 60 feet of you. You immediately learn the general function (or the specific mechanics, at the GM's discretion) of the possible magic items that can be crafted from the creature's harvestable components, as well as the effects of the magical meals you could make from it.
