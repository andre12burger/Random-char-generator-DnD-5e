    <text>Hermits of the Springwood, the bonze have as much in common with a druid's love of nature as with the discipline and ritual of the monk. They do not deign to shed the blood of other creatures and thus imbue their training swords, known as bokken, with the power to propel them out of harm's way. The thunderous wind rip is really just a tool for releasing hard-to-reach fruit.
	This magic weapon has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. It deals bludgeoning damage instead of a sword's normal slashing or piercing damage.

Gale: As an action, you can cause a cube of air up to 15 feet on a side to blow with a strong wind until the end of your next turn, dispersing any gasses.

Wind Rip: With a swish, you can send a concussive wave of sound streaking towards a target. When you take the Attack action while holding this blade, you can make ranged spell attacks known as 'wind rips' with the bokken. Wind rips have a range of 30/60 ft., +5 to hit, deal 1d8 thunder damage on a hit, and can be heard up to 100 feet away. On a critical hit, a creature is deafened until the end of its next turn. You can make as many wind rips as you have attacks.

Liftoff: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge, causing a sustained gust to lift you. Until the end of your current turn, you gain a flying speed of 40 feet. If you are not in contact with the ground or otherwise held aloft at the end of your turn, you fall.</text>

Club Music: As an action while holding the lute, you can play one of two brief but powerful songs. Once a song has been played, you can't play that song again until the next dawn.

	• 1. Panic! at the Tavern: You let loose a fast, chaotic melody that sows panic in the minds of your foes, forcing each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you that can hear you to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 psychic damage and is frightened of you for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	• 2. Mithrallica: You unleash an ear-shattering power chord that blows your foes away, forcing each creature in a 25-foot cone to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 thunder damage and is pushed 20 feet away from you, knocked prone, and deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the deafened condition on itself on a success.</text>

    <text>An ostentatiously ornate tommybow, the goldleaf bows are decorated with an array of bedazzling jewels. Rubies and sapphires sparkle with the fire and ice of the Hells, emeralds carry a vitriolic venom, and the diamonds glow with warm, bright sunlight, a delight peculiar to the pygmy rakshasa.
	This tommybow consists of five vertically stacked bows, each of which sports a pair of matched, randomly determined gemstones. Roll a d4 to determine each bow's gemstone pairs: 1, diamonds; 2, emeralds; 3, rubies; 4, sapphires.

Rakshasa's Revenge: You can use an action to imbue a piece of ammunition with one of the following spells (save DC 15) and fire the ammunition at a point or target within range: daylight (diamond), fireball (ruby), sleet storm (sapphire), or stench (emerald). When the ammunition hits a target or surface, it unleashes the imbued spell centered on that point. These spells do not require concentration. You can choose to fire at a point on a surface or at a target; if you miss the target, the effect is centred on whichever surface the ammunition hits (GM's discretion). The gems are destroyed when the spell is cast and their pieces fall to the ground.

Recharge: You can spend 1 minute replacing a pair of gemstones with diamonds, emeralds, rubies, or sapphires worth at least 100 gp each. So long as the gemstones are matching, then, at the next dawn, they sparkle with arcane power and can be used to imbue the bolts with the associated spells.</text>

Until reformed as a sword as a bonus action, this weapon loses its former sword properties and gains those of a whip.

Unquenchable Thirst: When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, it releases a deadly burst of desiccating, negative energy that drains moisture from a target, forcing it to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is desiccated for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't desiccated.

Point Blank Shot: When you hit a target with an attack using a loaded gunnspier, you can use a bonus action to pull the trigger, firing a plum-sized leaden ball at the target. The attack deals an additional 2d8 bludgeoning damage. As an action, you can reload the gunnspier.

Backfire: When you use Point Blank Shot and roll an 8 on both of the additional bludgeoning damage dice, the gunnspier backfires. Each creature within 10 feet of you (including you) must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 piercing damage as shrapnel erupts from the weapon.</text>

    <text>Three-weapons-in-one, this upgraded gunnspier can slash, shoot, and bite.
	"Stab, bang, hope." If consulted, these are the instructions any kobold will give on using a gunnspier. With a lengthy reload time and complete lack of accuracy, this matchlock-augmented polearm is usable at only one range: point blank. It also comes with a lovely ribbon and a neat basket to hold all your spare shot. Cute.
	You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Point Blank Shot: When you hit a target with an attack using a loaded gunnspier, you can use a bonus action to pull the trigger, firing a plum-sized leaden ball at the target. The attack deals an additional 3d8 bludgeoning damage. As an action, you can reload the gunnspier.

Chomp: The pneumatic-powered dragon's maw can run along the length of the gun's barrel before biting into a target skewered by its point.

    <text>This blade shouldn't work; the pneumatic seals are made of earwax and leather, the sprockets' teeth are all different sizes, and the structure itself is held together by an adhesive tape decorated with small ducks. The only explanation is that the sheer force of the kobold mechamagicians' belief is encapsulated within this magic sword, allowing it to chomp at its enemies.

Pneumatic Strike: After you make an attack roll with this weapon, but before the result of the attack is determined, you can use a bonus action to pull the blade's trigger. With a pneumatic thrust, the top of the weapon arcs forward and you gain a +4 bonus to the attack roll.

Tetanus Blade: When you hit a creature with an attack that uses Pneumatic Strike, the pathogens that live within the rusty blade are reinvigorated by its magic, and the attack deals an additional 1d8 poison damage.

Backfire: When you roll an 8 on Tetanus Blade's poison damage, dormant pathogens within surrounding creatures become reinvigorated. Each creature within 10 feet of you (including you) must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 4d6 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn.</text>

	With a refined pneumatic mechanism, this upgraded version of the pneuma blade is totally, indisputably, and inarguably, 98.4385% guaranteed not to backfire. The new-fangled heating element is also almost absolutely perfect.

Pneumatic Strike: After you make an attack roll with this weapon, but before the result of the attack is determined, you can use a bonus action to pull the blade's trigger. With a pneumatic thrust, the top of the weapon arcs forward and you gain a +5 bonus to the attack roll.

Heated Weapon: When you hit a creature with an attack that uses Pneumatic Strike, the pathogens that live within the rusty blade are reinvigorated by its magic, and the attack deals an additional 2d8 fire damage.

Burnout: When you use the Heated Weapon property of this weapon and roll an 8 on both of the additional fire damage dice, the heating mechanism backfires. Each creature within 10 feet of you (including you) must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 fire damage as scalding pneumatic fluid bursts out.</text>

    <detail>rare (optional attunement)</detail>
    <type>M</type>
    <text>Forged as a pair, these magic weapons are crafted from the matching upper and lower jaw bones of a tarrasque. Their innate magic—and one of the reasons the tar-rasque's bite is so powerful—creates an arcanomagnetic pull between the two jawbones, dealing devastating damage to whatever lies between them.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with each of these magic weapons. These weapons deal piercing damage instead of their usual damage type.

Chomp: When you engage in two-weapon fighting using these two weapons and hit the same target with both weapons, the attack you make with your second weapon deals an additional 1d8 damage.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to a pair of jaw breakers. They count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. When you do so, the weapons gain the Swirling Dervish property while you are attuned to them.

OA: Swirling Dervish: Harnessing the power of the blades, you leap over a target, becoming a tornado of lacerating blades. As an action while you wield both jaw breakers, you can perform a magically-enhanced jump, attacking creatures you pass over. This jump has a maximum distance of 20 feet, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.
	For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp's extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).</text>

    <text>From the fossilised teeth of a tar-rasque is extracted the magic of rage and ferocity. Upon attuning to this weapon, you gain the ability to unleash terrifyingly monstrous roars and swing the enormous, bone-handled blade with astounding aggression.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this magic weapon. This weapon has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn.

Ferocious Blow: As an action, you can expend 1 charge to call upon the spirit of the tar-rasque and make a mighty swing with this weapon. If the attack hits, roll four times as many damage dice for the weapon as normal for this attack. This dice multiplication does not affect additional damage from abilities such as smite or sneak attack, and is unaffected by critical hits. If the attack misses, you fall prone and your speed is reduced to 0 feet until the start of your next turn.

Terrorise: As a bonus action, or as part of the bonus action you use to activate the Rage class feature, you can brandish the terrorasque, amplifying your yell with that of a tar-rasque's. Each hostile creature within 60 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect for itself on a success. After you use this property, you can't do so again for 1 hour.</text>

Tar Strike: As an action, you can mentally command this weapon to ooze tar, expending 1 charge as you make one attack against a creature with it. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and is restrained for 1 minute. The creature can use its action to make a DC 16 Strength check, ending the restrained condition on a success.</text>
