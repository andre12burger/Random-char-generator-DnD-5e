      <name>Illrigger</name>
      <text>The archdevils who rule the Seven Cities of Hell scheme endlessly. Each eternally plots to bring the others to heel-to ascend to the Throne of Hell, unite the Seven Cities and every infernal being living there, and lead an inexhaustible army of devils across the timescape until all worlds burn.
	These archdevil's elite operatives are the illriggers. Knights, assassins, mages, and terror-commandos of Hell, ill riggers command the battlefield, disrupt enemy factions, and carry out their archdevil's infernal will.

Content Warning:
This class contains a subclass called the Hellspeaker, which has themes of mental manipulation and mind control. In addition, the Sanguine Knight subclass contains effects that manipulate another creature's blood. Lastly, illriggers are typically evil-aligned characters—and even those who aren't still serve evil creatures with dark agendas.

    <trait>
      <name>The Order of Desolation</name>
      <text>Millennia ago, the rulers of Hell did something remarkable: they cooperated. Together, they created the Order of Desolation—knights sworn to serve Hell first, their patron archdevil second.
	Those accepted into the Order of Desolation become comrades with every other illrigger, regardless of which archdevil they serve. Each archdevil has grand temples, underground fanes, secret societies, and sinister cults, all with leaders fanatically devoted to the archdevil who grants them their power. But the Order of Desolation stands above the petty political squabbles dividing the Seven Cities.
	Members of the Order of Desolation, also known as the Desolate, are expected to be intelligent, resourceful, tactical, and manipulative. The order was founded to give the archdevils capable agents who could act independently across the timescape, free from the direct control of their patron.
	An illrigger has many powerful abilities granted by their archdevil, but more precious is their patron's trust. Each illrigger is expected to sow discord, pain, strife, deceit, and fear without instruction or supervision. It's not unusual, therefore, for a Desolate to first rely on other order members—regardless of which archdevil they serve—before turning to an institution devoted to their own archdevil.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Diabolic Contract</name>
      <text>Those who walk the path of Hell may gain the powers of an illrigger purely through their own devotion. No oath is necessary, no mentor—a fledgling illrigger might not even be aware the Order of Desolation exists. But true acceptance as a Desolate means swearing an oath to a specific ruler of Hell. This usually requires a senior member of the order to perform an elaborate ritual, but a dedicated illrigger might attract the attention of an archdevil by doing deeds of great treachery on their own.
	At some point on the illrigger's journey, be it through ritual or deed, they find themself face-to-face with one of the rulers of the Seven Cities. When they do, a contract must be signed in blood—usually the knight's own. This binds the itinerant knight to the Order of Desolation and adds their name to the Lists of Hell.
	Though this experience can be intimidating, the rulers of Hell are usually easy masters and ask little from their chosen. The busy rulers of the Seven Cities pay little heed to the daily lives of their illriggers. Even breaches of precepts are overlooked; as long as the knight sows discord and opposes the Celestial Host, they successfully advance Hell's agenda.</text>

      <name>Creating an Illrigger</name>
      <text>To create an illrigger, consult the following subsections, which give you hit points, proficiencies, and starting equipment. Then look at the Illrigger table to see which features you get at each level. The descriptions of those features appear in the "Class Features" section.

Quick Build:
You can make an illrigger quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength (if you want to focus on melee weapons), Dexterity (if you want to focus on archery or finesse weapons), or Charisma (if you plan to choose the Architect of Ruin subclass). Your second highest ability score should be Constitution. Then, choose the soldier or outlander background from the core rules, or any background that gives proficiency in skills such as Athletics, Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion.</text>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Starting Illrigger</name>
        <text>As a 1st-level Illrigger, you begin play with 10 + your Constitution modifier hit points.

You are proficient with the following items, in addition to any proficiencies provided by your race or background.

	• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: none
	• Skills: Choose 2 from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, Survival

You begin play with the following equipment, in addition to any equipment provided by your background.

	• (a) two martial weapons or (b) one martial weapon and a shield
	• (a) chain shirt or (b) leather armor, a longbow, and 20 arrows
	• (a) a priest's pack or (b) a dungeoneer's pack
	• five javelins

Alternatively, you can forgo this starting equipment and the equipment granted by your background, instead starting with 5d4 × 10 gp.

        <name>Multiclass Illrigger</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose illrigger as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an illrigger.

	• Charisma 13, and
	• Strength 13, or Dexterity 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as an illrigger.

	• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: none

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

      <feature>
        <name>Baleful Interdict</name>
        <text>You gain the ability to censure creatures with the power of Hell. Once on your turn, you can place a magical seal on a creature within 30 feet of you. You can either place this seal when you hit that target with a weapon attack (no action required), or you can use a bonus action to place this seal on a target you can see within range. This seal lasts for 1 minute or until burned (see "Burning Seals" below). A creature with one or more of your seals is referred to as an interdicted creature. Seals you place are invisible to other creatures, and when you can see an interdicted creature, the seals appear to you as glowing glyphs on the creature's body.
	You can only place a limited number of seals before resting, and you regain all seals when you finish a short or long rest. The number of seals you can place increases as you gain illrigger levels, as indicated in the Seals column of the Illrigger table.
	If an interdicted creature dies, you can use a bonus action on your turn to move all seals placed on them to a new creature you can see within 30 feet of them. Each seal's duration continues to elapse when an interdicted creature dies and when that seal is moved to a new creature.

Burning Seals. When an interdicted creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage from any source other than a seal burned by an illrigger, you can burn any number of seals you placed on them to deal 1d6 fire or necrotic damage (your choice) to that creature per seal burned. You deal this damage immediately after the triggering damage. Burning a seal doesn't require an action from you, but you can't do so while incapacitated. Once a seal is burned, it immediately vanishes.
	Once you reach 5th level in this class, your connection to your archdevil strengthens. Each burned seal deals an extra 1d6 damage, for a total of 2d6. The damage of each seal increases again by 1d6 when you reach 11th level (for a total of 3d6) and 20th level (for a total of 4d6) in this class, as indicated in the Seal Damage column of the Illrigger table.

Interdict Save. Class features you gain later can add additional effects to your Baleful Interdict and require your target to make a saving throw to resist them. The saving throw DC for these effects uses your interdict save DC, which is calculated as follows:

	Interdict save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Burn vs. Expend. Burning a seal is part of the main gameplay loop of this class. The illrigger places a seal by using a bonus action or hitting a creature with an attack, then burns the seal for additional damage (as described in the Baleful Interdict class feature). Many interdict boons activate when you burn a seal; these burned seals deal the normal damage to the interdicted creature in addition to any effects granted by the boon.
	Other interdict boons instead require you to expend a seal. In this case, the illrigger expends an unplaced seal from their pool of available seals. This may require using an action, bonus action, or reaction, but not always (such as in the case of the Hellspeaker's Charm Enemy feature, where you can expend seals to increase the number of targets).
	Each active interdict boon details if any kind of action is required to expend the seal and activate the boon's benefit. Part of the illrigger's resource management is maximizing efficiency between burned seals (and their extra damage) and expended seals (and their unique effects).

      <feature>
        <name>Forked Tongue</name>
        <text>You can instinctively speak, read, and write Infernal.
	In addition, you can speak two other languages of your choice, but you can't read or write them. When you finish a long rest, you can draw on your archdevil's knowledge to replace one of these two languages. When you do, choose another language whose name you know; you magically forget the previous language and gain this new one instead. Once you replace a language in this way, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
	Starting at 9th level, this feature grants you another language, for a total of three (in addition to Infernal). Furthermore, you gain advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made to ascertain the intentions or sincerity of creatures.

      <feature>
        <name>Interdiction</name>
        <text>You can infuse your seals with hellish magical power, enhancing their effects.

Interdict Boons Known. You learn one interdict boon of your choice from the "Illrigger: Interdict Boons" spell list. As you gain levels in this class, you gain additional boons of your choice, as shown in the Interdict Boons table. Each new boon must be of a level you can learn. When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn one new boon of 2nd or 7th level.
	Whenever you gain an illrigger level, you can choose a boon you know and replace it with another boon you can learn.

Using Interdict Boons. Some boons allow you to expend unplaced seals to fuel abilities, while others empower all your seals or grant you benefits against interdicted creatures.
	The boons that grant passive (or "always on") benefits, such as the 2nd-level Swift Retribution boon, are marked with a "Passive" tag. You don't need to expend a seal or take an action to benefit from the passive boons you know. All other boons, such as the 2nd-level Abating Seal boon, must be activated on a turn (for example, by expending a seal). You can activate only one non-passive boon per turn, regardless of how many you know.

        <name>Infernal Conduit</name>
        <text>You can strengthen your allies at the cost of yourself—or drain your enemy's life force for your own gain. You have a pool of Infernal Conduit dice, which are d10s. The number of Infernal Conduit dice in your pool increase as you gain illrigger levels, as shown in the Infernal Conduit Dice table.
	As an action, you can touch another creature and spend one or more dice from your pool. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your interdict save DC. A creature can willingly fail this saving throw. Roll the spent dice and choose one of the following effects:

Invigorate. On a failed save, the target regains hit points equal to the total you rolled, and you take necrotic damage equal to that total. On a successful save, the target regains half as many hit points, and you take necrotic damage equal to that total. Save or fail, this necrotic damage can't be reduced in any way, and if this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious and are stabilized.

Devour. On a failed save, the target takes necrotic damage equal to the total you rolled, and you regain hit points equal to that total. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you regain hit points equal to the damage the target took. Save or fail, or if the target chose to fail their saving throw against this effect, the necrotic damage can't be reduced in any way. When you reach 11th level in this class, the target also gains a level of exhaustion on a failed save against this effect. This level of exhaustion can be reduced as normal, and a creature can't suffer more than three levels of exhaustion combined from all illriggers' Infernal Conduit features.

You regain any spent Infernal Conduit dice when you finish a long rest.

Inferno. Hellfire rains down on your foes. Each enemy in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 fire damage plus 5d10 necrotic damage, and they burn for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not burn.

This hellfire can't be extinguished by nonmagical means.

Pestilence. A foul miasma swirls around your foes. Each enemy in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 poison damage plus 5d10 necrotic damage and becomes poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not become poisoned.

Darkness. A bitter storm assails your foes. Each enemy in that area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the storm's gloom persists for 1 minute, and each enemy within that area is blinded for the duration or until they leave the area.

Once you summon a hellstorm, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

        <name>Diabolic Contract: Architect of Ruin</name>
        <text>Architects of Ruin are cool and calculating arcane knights who serve Asmodeus, deploying spells, steel, and subterfuge to win at any cost.

Asmodeus rules Acheron, the City of Fear. His illriggers scour the timescape, collecting secrets and spells designed to deceive and terrify his opponents. The war he fights against the other archdevils is one of deception and information.
	His Architects of Ruin work to make Hell's enemies seem outnumbered and outmaneuvered. These illriggers are skillful spellblades on the battlefield, though some employ tactics such as research, infiltration, and propaganda to play mind games with their quarry. When an Architect of Ruin finally confronts an enemy, the advantage is theirs—they have studied, prepared, and gripped fate within their gauntlet, forcing it to favor them. They hungrily seek the dark arts to arm both themselves and Asmodeus with the impossible.

The Battlefield of the Mind. By the time my armies meet yours, you'll be filled with terror and doubt your own strength. I won't have to lift a finger to defeat you.

The Proper Secret. Once I know your secrets, I know your weakness.

Knowledge Is Power. Lore is as powerful as steel. I learn every detail about my enemy and anticipate their every move, checkmating them before the game even begins.

Magic Is Mine to Command. Cunning is also as powerful as steel. I wield the dark arcane arts to manipulate your senses, weaken your resolve, and strengthen my blade. Your soldiers will quake for fear of what dark magics may next cloak my blade.

        <name>Spellcasting (Architect of Ruin)</name>
        <text>As an Architect of Ruin, you access a well of profane magic to cast spells. See "Spellcasting" in the core rules for the general rules of spellcasting.

Cantrips:
You know two cantrips of your choice from the Architect of Ruin spell list (presented at the end of this subclass). You learn an additional cantrip from this list at 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Architect of Ruin Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your illrigger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell hellish rebuke and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast hellish rebuke using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
At 3rd level, you know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Architect of Ruin spell list (presented at the end of this subclass).
	The Spells Known column of the Architect of Ruin Spellcasting table shows when you learn more illrigger spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the illrigger spells you know with another spell of your choice from the illrigger spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spellcasting Focus:
You have an unholy symbol, such as an amulet symbolizing your archdevil, a fragment of a blasphemous relic, or a glass orb holding a consecrated drop of archdevil blood. You can use the unholy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your illrigger spells. You must have a free hand to use the unholy symbol, but it can be the same hand you use to perform somatic components.

Axiomatic Seals (7th Level; Passive). Asmodeus's secrets allow you to infuse your seals with manifest power. When you burn one or more seals to deal damage to a creature, you can activate this boon (no action required) to add your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) to each seal's damage roll.

Spellbreaker (13th Level). When an interdicted creature you can see within 60 feet of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction to burn one or more of the seals on them. When you do, burning the seal deals no damage, and instead you cast counterspell on them without expending a spell slot. Your spell's level increases by 1 for every additional seal you burn after the first.

Hell Mage (18th Level; Passive). When you or an ally within 30 feet of you succeed on a saving throw against a spell or other magical effect imposed by an enemy, you can immediately place one or more seals on that enemy, up to a number equal to your proficiency bonus.

Moloch rules Styx, the City of Lies, but his reach extends far beyond it. Hell's greatest politicians and diplomats rise to prominence through Moloch's subtle manipulations. They follow him with great loyalty, for they know they are nothing without him—and thus his power echoes through all of Hell.
	Moloch's illriggers are silver-tongued enchanters, lulling his foes to complacency with sorcery and subterfuge until they wake and find themselves under the command of the Order of Desolation. These Hellspeakers train in the art known as the Red Cant or Hell's Cant. By understanding their enemy and through weaving subtle sorceries into normal speech, Hellspeakers can make their foes feel, think, or do nearly anything to accelerate Hell's victory.
	Across the timescape, Hellspeakers enjoy a reputation as smiling rogues and swashbuckling villains. An asset in any negotiation, Hellspeakers know that in a world of lies, the truth can be as potent a weapon as steel.

Content Warning:
This subclass has themes of mental manipulation and mind control. Before choosing this subclass, please ensure everyone at the table is comfortable exploring these dark and harmful themes. And as always, we encourage the ongoing use of safety tools throughout your game.

        <name>Quid Pro Quo (Hellspeaker)</name>
        <text>You can whisper to the legions of Hell, ensnaring enemies and calling allies. As an action, you can attempt to banish a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is banished to the wastes of Hell for 1 minute, after which they return to the unoccupied space nearest to the one they left. A target banished in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect early on a success. A creature who succeeds on a saving throw against this effect becomes immune to your Quid Pro Quo for 24 hours.
	Additionally, when a target is banished in this way, a devil jurist (from MCDM's Flee, Mortals!) or a horned devil (from the core rules) appears in their place. This devil acts as an ally to you and follows your commands until the banished creature is no longer banished, at which time the devil disappears.
	Once you successfully banish a creature in this way, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

        <name>Diabolic Contract: Painkiller</name>
        <text>The heavily armored death troopers of Hell, Painkillers serve Dispater, leading from the front of every major infernal battle.

Dispater rules Dis, the City of War. When Hell invades another world, Dispater's army does the fighting and dying. His Painkillers are master strategists who lead from the front, inspiring terror and awe in their soldiers. The imperious Painkillers are full of pride and hubris, and they often obsess over their personal appearance.
	Though among the most chivalrous of the illriggers, a Painkiller's gallantry is twisted. They accept and honor challenges to single combat, and swiftly punish any who try to interfere—but if losing, they don't hesitate to cheat, and if winning, they arrogantly toy with an enemy before finishing them.
	In a moment of weakness or desperation, a ruler in another world might see their army facing certain defeat and call on Dispater. Ever eager to sow strife and discord, Dispater often responds to these pleas by sending a Painkiller to lead the desperate ruler's armies.

        <text>Dispater's heavy shock troops must be effective battlefield commanders and quickly dispatch enemies. Painkillers follow precepts instructing them to lead Hell's armies and wage war against Good across the timescape.

Lead from the Front. I charge in at the front of every battle, inspiring my soldiers and terrifying my enemies.

Commander. Wherever I go, I command. I don't take orders from those who don't have the will to lead.

Victory at Any Cost. I respect the enemy leader and treat them honorably. But once swords are drawn, I use every trick in my arsenal to win, expecting them to do the same.

Soldiers Die. I care not for the lives of my soldiers, for they are resources I spend to secure my victory.

        <text>The blood-knights of Hell, Sanguine Knights serve Sutekh, Lord of Blood. Their sorceries drain their enemies' life force, pouring this stolen vitality into infernal rituals to turn the tide of battle.

Sutekh rules Naraka, the City of Blood. Recognized as the greatest sorcerer in hell, he carries the title of High Sanguinary and rules from the Temple of Vitality. He is a master of blood magic, and his inner circle of priests and wizards are the Bloodliches, undead spellcasters whose corporeal forms turned to ash centuries ago and whose bodies are crafted from solid blood.
	Sutekh's illriggers all belong to a cult known as the Chalice of Vitality. Knights of the Chalice drink deeply of their enemies' essence, draining it to power their magics. Other members of the Order of Desecration fear that the Sanguine Knights seek more than Sutekh's mere ascension to the Throne of Hell; some whisper that the Chalice secretly schemes to make Sutekh a god. This would, of course, be treason.

Loyalty Rewarded. My boons lead my allies to depend on me—and on the bloodshed that empowers me.

Another creature you can see within 60 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer that same condition until the end of your next turn.

Belial rules Gehennom, the City of Darkness. He strives to rule Hell through poison, torture, and assassination. His illriggers strike from the shadows or use deception to earn high-ranking positions close to powerful rulers. Many Shadowmasters run networks of spies and assassins who have no idea of the infernal provenance of their leader.
	Shadowmasters are sworn not to reveal their true allegiance, and if need be, they must take their own lives to fulfill this oath. Many Shadowmasters prepare elaborate plans for their own assassination so that, should they risk discovery, their assassination obscures the truth. Of course, these killers never learn they were hired by their deceased target.
