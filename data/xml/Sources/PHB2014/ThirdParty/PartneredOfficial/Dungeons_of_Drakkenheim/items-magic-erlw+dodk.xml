    <text>The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you're an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you're not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you're worthy to wield it.

This sword has a small delerium sliver encased in glass and set in the hilt like a gemstone. The blade is made of meteoric iron infused with delerium dust, which causes it to softly glow with octarine light.
	You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
	When you make an attack with this weapon, you can use your spellcasting ability modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. In addition, you can use this weapon as a spellcasting focus.
	When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a humanoid, the humanoid must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take an extra (3d6) necrotic damage and gain one level of contamination.

Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: martial, double-bladed scimitar
