    <text>The head of this bludgeoning weapon is made from a massive delerium crystal that crackles with arcane energies. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra (3d6) necrotic damage.
	When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, it unleashes an arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim). You can roll twice on the table and choose either result.

Arcane Anomalies:
1d20 | Arcane Anomalies
1 | Gravity breaks within a 100-foot radius area for 1 hour. Creatures levitate in midair, and must move by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows them to move as if they were climbing. Unattended objects float around randomly.
2 | The nearest creature is affected by a hideous laughter spell (Save DC 15) but instead of laughing, the creature repeats unfathomable combinations of syllables and words.
3 | Time skips a beat. Creatures within 60 feet experience a palpable feeling of vertigo followed by a powerful sensation of deja vu and are stunned for 1 round (No save).
4 | The nearest creature becomes unstuck in time. It is affected by the blink spell for 1 minute. Instead of vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, the creature vanishes into a sliver of time in its past or possible future.
5 | A prismatic burst of energy erupts in a 20-foot radius. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 radiant damage and become blinded for 1 round. The smell of ozone fills the area, and wood transforms into glass.
6 | Echoes of possible realities are briefly visible for 1 minute. When a creature within 60 feet is hit by an attack, a faint vision of the creature being killed by that attack appears.
7 | Discordant music fills the mind of all creatures within 30 feet, who are affected as if by irresistible dance (Save DC 15).
8 | A section of stone, water, air, or energy becomes an appropriate contaminated elemental.
9 | An extraplanar creature is summoned and remains for 1 hour. The DM either chooses the creature or determines it randomly. It is friendly to the creature who triggered the anomaly.
10 | All humanoid corpses within 120 feet animate as hostile haze husks. The shrieking undead beg frantically for forgiveness as they rip apart the living.
11 | The shadows of 1d6 random creatures in the area animate and try to kill them. Once destroyed, the creatures don't cast a shadow for 24 hours.
12 | All creatures within 60 feet become invisible for 1 min or until they attack or cast a spell.
13 | Tendrils of life flow from the nearest creature to others. It must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 8d8 necrotic damage, half on a success. The three nearest creatures within 60 feet each regain hit points equal to the damage taken.
14 | A hypnotic pattern (save DC 15) appears. It creates scintillating impossible colours in shapes which are simply wrong. Creatures incapacitated by the spell weep uncontrollably.
15 | A black tentacles spell appears in the area for 1 hour (Escape DC 15).
16 | Objects within 60 feet come to life for the next hour, as if affected by the animate objects spell. They mumble awful truths, but are not otherwise hostile.
17 | The nearest creature is polymorphed into an awakened shrub for 1 hour or until reduced to 0 hp (No save).
18 | Time slows down for up to six randomly determined creatures within 120 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the slow spell for 1 minute. (Save DC 15).
19 | Time speeds up for one randomly determined creature within 60 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the haste spell for 1 minute.
20 | A bowl of flowers and a very surprised aquatic mammal appear 100 feet in the air. "Oh no, not again..." thinks the flowers.</text>

    <detail>rare</detail>
    <type>A</type>
    <text>This piece of ammunition has a refined delerium arrowtip. A creature hit by a ranged attack using one of these arrows takes an extra (3d6) necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of contamination.

    <detail>rare (requires attunement)</detail>
    <match>Crossbow,Hand Crossbow,Heavy Crossbow,light Crossbow,Light Repeating Crossbow,Longbow,Shortbow</match>
    <text>This magical bow or crossbow has an intricate arrangement of delerium shards and focusing lenses along the stock where a bolt would normally be loaded, and instead magically conjures its own projectiles. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of piercing damage and ignores the ammunition and loading properties.
	The weapon has 3 charges, which are regained each day at dawn. When you hit with a ranged attack using it, you can cause the bolt to explode in a brilliant flash of light. The target you hit and any creatures within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn.</text>
