    <description>Contaminated Elementals can be found all over Drakkenheim, often in areas where the eldritch magics are especially concentrated. Many who have encountered these elementals have spoken of the city itself coming to life to attack them. Reports of ruins reaching out and crushing adventurers, burning flames moving and hunting with minds of their own, or contaminated pools lurching to engulf passersby have been heard. Even the blowing air itself has mustered parts of the Haze into shifting clouds that stalk adventurers through the streets. These magical creatures are a constant reminder that nothing in the city can be trusted, and that nowhere is truly safe.

Other chaplains are fiery zealots who can prepare faerie fire, burning hands, scorching ray, flaming sphere, fireball, and wall of fire.

    <description>The Crimson Countess is a powerful harpy matriarch. Recognizable by her red-feathered wings and deep crimson hair, she is clad in black and gold armour and carries with her a spear that crackles with electrical energies.

Personality Trait:
I screech blood-curdling war cries and perform aerial stunts as intimidation.

Ideal:
Any who walk the earth are prey for those who soar the sky.

Bond:
I collect trophies from my kills to remind my flock who is the mightiest.

Flaw:
I am aggressively territorial, envious of my rivals, and covetous of my trinkets.

— Elias Drexel

Many who succumb to contamination become grotesque mockeries of their former selves. They suffer a wretched and loathsome fate, aimlessly wandering the ruins following half-forgotten memories. Most are gripped by despair, fear, and madness which drive them to act violently, though a rare few experience lucidity and a gruesome awareness of their miserable state. Their distorted and emaciated bodies are sustained by the magic of the Haze.

These mutated creatures have piscine faces, gills, fins, and fish scales. They are garbed in wet rags and carry spears and shields, and dwell deep within the sewers and underground caverns below the city.

Many who succumb to contamination become grotesque mockeries of their former selves. They suffer a wretched and loathsome fate, aimlessly wandering the ruins following half-forgotten memories. Most are gripped by despair, fear, and madness which drive them to act violently, though a rare few experience lucidity and a gruesome awareness of their miserable state. Their distorted and emaciated bodies are sustained by the magic of the Haze.

    <description>Contaminated Elementals can be found all over Drakkenheim, often in areas where the eldritch magics are especially concentrated. Many who have encountered these elementals have spoken of the city itself coming to life to attack them. Reports of ruins reaching out and crushing adventurers, burning flames moving and hunting with minds of their own, or contaminated pools lurching to engulf passersby have been heard. Even the blowing air itself has mustered parts of the Haze into shifting clouds that stalk adventurers through the streets. These magical creatures are a constant reminder that nothing in the city can be trusted, and that nowhere is truly safe.

    <description>Once thought to be related to gnolls, garmyr are bipedal canids unique to the Haze-ridden ruins of Drakkenheim. Often covered in thick fur, their colouration and features vary from hound-like to wolf-like, but all bear sharp teeth and claws. They form hyper-aggressive and predatory warpacks equipped with weapons taken from the many failed military attempts to reclaim the city. These beasts revel in their countless battles with adventurers and the Hooded Lanterns. The garmyr warpacks have made the Inner City their hunting ground, but have been sighted roving the countryside with increasing frequency. They live for the thrill of the hunt, and mock and taunt their prey as they chase them down. Though the warpacks are prone to infighting, a massive beast known as the Lord of the Feast rules the garmyr as their overlord, master, and god.

      <text>Magical octarine beams flash from the Gravekeeper's many lanterns. Each beam has a different power. Each creature within 120 feet of the Gravekeeper which is not behind total cover rolls a d6 to determine which colour ray affects it. The DC for all saving throws is 18:

1. Dispelling Blast:
The targeted creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 35 (10d6) psychic damage, and any spell or magical effect upon the target ends. A creature who fails this saving throw has their concentration broken on any spell they were actively maintaining.

2. Forceful Blast:
The targeted creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 35 (10d6) force damage, be pushed 20 feet away, and knocked prone.

3. Blinding Blast:
The targeted creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 35 (10d6) radiant damage and be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw on each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

4. Contamining Blast:
The targeted creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 35 (10d6) necrotic damage and gain one level of contamination.

5. Igniting Blast:
The targeted creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 35 (10d6) fire damage, and catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 35 (10d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

6. Freezing Blast:
The targeted creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 35 (10d6) cold damage, and it can't take a reaction until the end of its next turn. Moreover, on its next turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and suffers none of the blast's other effects.</text>

    <description>"The Royal Crypts below Castle Drakken housed the bodies of kings and queens, dukes and nobles of generations gone. They were tended by the many gravekeepers who worked diligently to light the lanterns below so the dead could have safe passage to the light. I shudder to think what has become of those crypts, and their keepers, in these dark times."
— Overheard from a party of nobles in the Red Lion Hotel

The Gravekeeper is a hovering mass of writhing appendages. Amongst its horrid and grotesque form one can make out the many faces of long lost gravekeepers of Castle Drakken, but their expressions are twisted in horror of their last moments, and their eyes are hollow with a dim octarine light emanating from within. Covering the floating mass are hundreds of arms, several of them holding softly glowing lanterns. The lanterns glow with octarine flames that cast flickering shadows across the crypt. The Gravekeeper wanders amongst the dead, awakening them into grasping souls, clawing their way out of the many graves amongst the lordly tombs of the castle.

Lair Actions:
When fighting inside its lair, the Gravekeeper can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Gravekeeper can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:

	• A 10 foot radius cylinder of delerium sludge spouts up from the floor and raises 30 feet into the air before bubbling back down. Any creature caught in this spout must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. They take 42 (12d6) necrotic damage on a failed saving throw, and half as much on a successful one. In addition, characters who fail the saving throw gain one level of contamination.

	• Walls within 120 feet of the Gravekeeper sprout grasping, fleshy arms. Each creature of the Gravekeepers choice that starts its turn within 10 feet of such a wall must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

	• A torch or lantern hanging in the room emits one of the Gravekeeper's lantern blasts.

The Gravekeeper can't repeat an effect until they have all been used, and it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

    <description>These mutated human monstrosities have grown to tremendous size. Delerium shards are merged into their disfigured bodies, and their muscles pulse with arcane energies as they lumber forward. Furiously territorial, these creatures are occasionally sighted hauling massive delerium crystals from the crater and placing them like obelisks in the ruins.

He wears gleaming silver plate armour etched with golden trim, and carries a shimmering sword and a broad shield engraved with the symbol of the Sacred Flame.

Personality Trait:
I act with determined calm and respect. Little rouses my anger, instead I respond with disappointment when others incite my ire.

Ideal:
I believe that good-hearted people can set aside their differences to work together.

Bond:
I am willing to lay down my life for a just and righteous cause.

Flaw:
I will never give up on my comrades. I do not trade lives.

      <text>When a creature that can see Lenore's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of her, Lenore can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if she isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. The creature takes 22 (4d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. In addition, creatures who fail this saving throw gain one level of contamination.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see Lenore until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Lenore in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If Lenore sees herself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of her and in an area of bright light, she becomes blinded and incapacitated for 1d6 hours.</text>

    <description>Transformed by the Haze, Lenore is a mockery of her former self and abhorrently reacts to her own appearance. She dimly remembers seeking shelter in her grotto, but has no recollection of how she escaped the castle.

Personality Trait:
I speak softly in a perpetual daydream, rhapsodically imagining myself to be in a tragic fairytale while casting others in fictional roles.

Ideal:
The world is a mirror held up to my own glorious reflection.

Bond:
I obsessively crave beauty, decadence, and relish in art of all kinds, and especially love my garden and my lilies. They are all I have left.

Flaw:
I fly into an enraged fury at the sight of my own likeness or the names of my lost family members.

Any character proficient in History can instantly recognize Lenore despite her mutations. Before her transformation, Lenore was extraordinarily vain and narcissistic, though was uncharastically kind and gentle to her servants. She wore outrageously ornamented gowns, hats, makeup, and jewelry, including a famous golden necklace set with eleven emeralds. She loved her children only as extensions of herself, and absolutely despised her husband.

    <description>Contaminated Elementals can be found all over Drakkenheim, often in areas where the eldritch magics are especially concentrated. Many who have encountered these elementals have spoken of the city itself coming to life to attack them. Reports of ruins reaching out and crushing adventurers, burning flames moving and hunting with minds of their own, or contaminated pools lurching to engulf passersby have been heard. Even the blowing air itself has mustered parts of the Haze into shifting clouds that stalk adventurers through the streets. These magical creatures are a constant reminder that nothing in the city can be trusted, and that nowhere is truly safe.

    <description>Lord Commander Elias Drexel is a man in his early fifties. He is stocky and imposing with a furrowed brow and a grim frown on his wide and angular face. His harsh features are framed with a thick moustache, side chops, and a mane of long braided brown hair. He is garbed in chainmail armour with heavy leather gloves and boots, worn under a fur-lined dark green cloak and iron pauldrons. He wears a pinned brooch the Lord Commander's Badge, the symbol of his office. A quiver, a longbow, and two longswords are strung on his back.

Personality Trait:
I am blunt and direct, and expect my soldiers to obey my commands and deliver results promptly. I find no humor in anything.

Ideal:
Loyalty and trust are priceless. They must be carefully given, but staunchly held. There is nothing worse than betrayal and treason.

Bond:
During the Civil War, I switched sides and killed several scions of House von Kessel who could have claimed the throne. I once believed it was for the right cause, but now I feel personally responsible for breaking the royal line. My mission in Drakkenheim is penance and redemption.

Flaw:
I'm filled with rage and conflict because of my contradictory actions and beliefs, and I don't take defeat, setbacks, or even missteps lightly.

Lord Commander Elias Drexel was appointed to the office of Lord Commander before the fall of Drakkenheim, and was outside the city leading training drills when the meteor fell. Afterwards, he took part in three military expeditions to reclaim Drakkenheim, and saw firsthand their horrors. He then went on to fight in the Westemär Civil War alongside Mannfred von Kessel. However, the idea that his soldiers died for nothing in Drakkenheim festered in his mind, and made him doubt Mannfred's ability to be a good ruler. He secretly participated in a successful conspiracy to assassinate Mannfred von Kessel. Little did he know that shortly thereafter, tragedy would soon befall Cecilia von Kessel. He isn't exactly proud of his choice to betray Mannfred, and that causes him considerable guilt, regret, and internal self-loathing.

    </legendary>
    <description>This horrific albino garmyr stands well over twelve feet tall. He is covered in a mass of yellowish-white mangy fur, bloodstained and scarred from countless battles, and clad in a patchwork armour of leather, chain, and bladed plate with trophies—mummified heads—hanging from his belt. A mane of bony spines and tufts of barbed grey hair jut out from his head and down his back to a long white tail braided with skulls and bone fragments. His snarling visage is filled with long, razor-sharp fangs and smouldering red eyes. The Lord of The Feast holds an oversized longbow, strung with thick sinew. A quiver on his back holds enormous arrows, some bristling with barbed snares, others connected to coils of chains around the beast's wrists, while others are tipped with delerium shards.

    <description>Lucretia Mathias is a willowy and wizened woman with piercing eyes and pursed lips. She is in her early nineties, and keeps her greying black hair in a coiled bun beneath a linen shawl. She wears simple grey robes, and clutches a heavy leather-bound tome. A glowing golden crystal dangles from a silver chain around her neck. Her garb lightly conceals the delerium shard embedded in her heart.

Personality Trait:
I speak in proverbs and quote scripture when I speak, inspiring others to interpret my cryptic words and come to their own revelations.

Ideal:
The brightest lights shine in the darkest of places. None are beyond redemption, and all may find their inner truth and purpose by following the Falling Fire.

Bond:
I have foreseen the inevitable end of our world, but through our sacred self-sacrifice we shall set alight the Sacred Flame to bring enlightenment and salvation to the universe.

Flaw:
I only reveal the greatest truths I have seen to those I am certain can grasp them fully, and will understand them as I do.

    <description>Minazorond is eternally bound to serve as the guardian of Castle Drakken. He roosts atop the Stair Tower of the royal palace with his mind awash in nightmares. The dragon now believes the monstrous creatures dwelling in the castle to be its proper inhabitants, and perceives humanoid creatures as trespassers to be destroyed. Minazorond awakes with a thunderous roar that can be heard for miles away, and attacks if intruders approach within one hundred fifty feet of the royal palace by any means. The dragon does not speak, nor respond to reason or parley. He does not pursue his quarry beyond the castle grounds. However, Minazorond is too large to enter buildings or the palace, and cannot pursue creatures who flee inside.

Minazorond may be rebuked by a creature bearing aSeal of Drakkenheim. Only a wish spell can cure his madness: he interacts as a dutiful, stoic, and wise protector thereafter.

    <description>This malfeasant wizard fled the Amethyst Academy ten years ago. Oscar Yoren has since taken up residence on the north side of Drakkenheim in Reed Manor, and survived on the outskirts of the city through his grim intellect, ruthless self-interest, and willingness to practice unsavoury forms of alchemy and necromancy. Several other outcast mages have since joined him as apprentices.

Oscar Yoren is a short, wide man in his mid-fifties. He wears slovenly leather breeches and a filthy black overcoat. He has shoulder-length greasy black hair and a thick beard of wiry unshaven hair creeping down his flabby neck. His skin is covered in sores and pasty blotches, with bulging blood veins under his neck. His sunken bloodshot eyes glare with a purple-green light. He has yellow teeth and fingernails.

Personality Trait:
I talk down to anyone who isn't as intelligent as I am which is everyone. I demand attention when I'm speaking, and make thinly-veiled threats when I don't get my way.

Ideal:
The Amethyst Academy doesn't understand my methods, but I cannot unlock the secrets of delerium if I am hindered by petty morality and useless ethics. If I had proper facilities and resources, unimaginable power would be mine.

Bond:
My apprentices are useful as long as they are loyal and don't question me, but disposable the moment they aren't. Only my own survival matters.

Flaw:
I hold vindictive grudges against everyone who ever wronged me. I'll have my revenge someday, but I fear acting against those with more power or resources than me. I must hide for now, as I'm terrified the Academy will send assassins to kill me and steal my brilliant research.

Oscar Yoren's spellbook contains all the spells he has prepared, plus alarm, find familiar, glyph of warding, contact other plane, dispel magic, dimension door, magic circle, and planar binding.

    <description>Friedrich Von Lichten ambitiously explored the mutagenic effects of delerium after Drakkenheim's destruction, and was among the first to fully describe the effects of eldritch contamination upon the human body. He was ejected from the Amethyst Academy when it was discovered he was using apprentices as test subjects. So grave was his trespass, that the Academy notified the Silver Order of his existence, putting a death bounty on his head. Both The Silver Order and the Amethyst Academy have been searching for him since.

Personality Trait:
Witness my power, understand that I am the future. Some may call me a god, and I would not correct them.

Ideal:
We must embrace the Haze, and allow contamination to change us, make us better.

Bonds:
The Amethyst Academy lacks vision. I will show them the true power of delerium.

Flaw:
It is not enough that I merely outsmart my foes, they must be shown their weakness and failure.

Friedrich von Lichten has fully embraced contamination and transformed into a monster, and is now the Pale Man (see Appendix A ofDungeons of Drakkenheimfor game statistics). He has maintained his intellect, and drapes his hunched and withered figure in a black cloak. Beneath his paper-thin skin are wriggling and writhing things. His lidless eyes are sunken, his teeth are prominent, yellowing and decaying. One can just make out a sickly green tongue that darts out when he speaks. He talks in a stunted, almost exasperated tone.

He presents his estate as a safehouse for the lost and forgotten.

The Pale Man sows the rumours that he can help contaminated people so he can use them as test subjects for his experiments. When he meets a transformed or contaminated creature, he presents himself as a helpful expert, offering to treat any individual left in his care. He never actually cures contamination, but sometimes helps other transformed monsters become somewhat lucid so he can make better use of them as minions. The Pale Man spends most of his time in the repurposed master bedroom of the estate he uses as his laboratory, and gives orders only to his most trusted thralls.

    <description>"Who I am is not as important as what I am. I am quicker than thought, more silent than contemplation, more slippery than a fading memory, and more unshakable than a guilty conscience. I deal in secrets and mendacity as lesser thieves deal in coins and larceny. I can fulfil your wildest dreams, or I can be your worst nightmare."
— The Queen of Thieves.

The Queen of Thieves is a scheming mastermind who controls the Drakkenheim underworld. She has transformed a hundred squabbling bands of brigands and outlaws into a burgeoning criminal empire. However, none know her true identity or origin, for she wears many faces. Though she is most infamously encountered as a lithe masked woman garbed in swashbuckling attire with a wide-brimmed hat and jewelled rapier, the Queen of Thieves adopts a variety of costumes, facial features, skin and hair colours, body shapes, ages, and genders depending on her mood and circumstances. As such, she typically confirms her identity by revealing some secret about whoever she is speaking with or demonstrating her uncanny ability to change appearance seemingly at-will.

Personality Trait:
I am never caught unprepared, and have contingencies for my contingencies. I speak with rakish confidence while casually exposing everything I know about others, and flaunt my ability to be anybody or anywhere.

Ideal:
I indulge in playing mind games and manipulating people with the promise of profit. Instead of spilling blood, I spill secrets. My enemies are worthless as corpses. When I have to steal lives, I spend them dearly first.

Bond:
Law is powerless in the chaos of the ruins. As long as anarchy reigns, so shall I.

Flaw:
Anyone who trusts me is a terrible fool. Double-crossing is my nature. I expect everyone to betray me, and I'll relish the opportunity to defeat them when they try.

Few amongst the Queen's Men have met the Queen of Thieves in person, and even fewer have attended the Court of Thieves. Most only know if they get a note attached to a Queen of Diamonds playing card, you better do what it says.

    <description>"A pair of glinting yellow-purple eyes appear down the dark tunnel ahead, then another, then more. A scurrying mass of furry bodies bound up in mud-spattered cloth and greasy leather surge forward. Their rodent-like claws brandish rust-caked blades as many squeaking voices erupt into a cacophony of chittering, chirping, screeching, and finally a howl of "Kill! Kill! Kill!""

Ratlings are oversized mutated rats imbued with malevolent cunning and driven by a mad compulsion to consume and multiply. These wretched monsters suffer from a constant internal struggle between cowardly survival instincts and violent impulsive urges. Ratlings dream of eating everything, and will eat anything, but love eating people. They especially love eating babies. While they will subsist on carrion, ratlings take captives back to their lairs so they can have fresh food later. Thousands of ratlings dwell in the city. They form warring colonies that dig maze-like burrows featuring multiple entrances and tight looping passages. Successful colonies grow in number quickly, as ratlings mature in a matter of weeks when ample food and delerium are available.

    <description>Contaminated Elementals can be found all over Drakkenheim, often in areas where the eldritch magics are especially concentrated. Many who have encountered these elementals have spoken of the city itself coming to life to attack them. Reports of ruins reaching out and crushing adventurers, burning flames moving and hunting with minds of their own, or contaminated pools lurching to engulf passersby have been heard. Even the blowing air itself has mustered parts of the Haze into shifting clouds that stalk adventurers through the streets. These magical creatures are a constant reminder that nothing in the city can be trusted, and that nowhere is truly safe.

Many ratlings worship a fiendish entity they call the Rat God. They construct crude effigies to the Rat God, who whispers to the most cunning and intelligent ratlings, granting them magic through eldritch pacts. Ratlings understand surprisingly little about the Rat God, and make up stories and fables about the Rat God's exploits.

      <text>One humanoid that the warp witch can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the warp witch; the warp witch then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The warp witch now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The warp witch can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the warp witch ends it as a bonus action, or the warp witch is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the warp witch reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this warp witch's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</text>

    <description>These ethereal phantoms haunt the places where they died, grasping for any memory of their former identities. Their mental anguish breaks the minds of those who hear their wails, and they induce rapid mutations when they possess humanoid bodies.
