    <magic>YES</magic>
    <weight>0.075</weight>
    <text>These steel crossbow bolts were first created by the Jaggenstrike Clan during the Scattered War, and the secret to crafting them remains well guarded by the Houses of Kraghammer. Cataclysm bolts are usually kept in sets of ten, though anyone who holds even one can feel it thrumming with magical power. When you hit with an attack using a cataclysm bolt, the attack deals normal damage. Then roll a d6 on the following table to determine its additional effect.

Cataclysm Bolt Effects:
d6 | Effect
1-2 | The bolt explodes in a blast of fire, dealing 3d8 fire damage to the target and each creature within 5 feet of it.
3-4 | The bolt freezes the air around the target into jagged ice. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 cold damage and be restrained until the end of your next turn.
5 | The bolt releases a pulse of necrotic energy. The target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
6 | The bolt shatters to unleash a burst of shrapnel. Make six additional ranged attacks against the target, each of which has a +7 attack bonus and deals 1d6 piercing damage on a hit.

Once the bolt hits, the enchantment ends and it becomes a normal piece of ammunition.

    <text>This exquisite brocade coat is cut in a long, high-collared style popular among nobles of the Clovis Concord—a nation on the west coast of Wildemount whose stylish fashion is often mimicked in Tal'Dorei. Its shimmering lining hints at its magical properties. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this coat, which can be worn over light armor.
	Additionally, the coat has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you are the target of an attack while wearing this coat, you can spend 1 charge as a reaction to gain resistance to one type of damage from the triggering attack. This resistance is effective against the triggering attack and lasts until the start of your next turn.

    <text>This dark metal blade bends in a wicked, hooked curve. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can spend 1 Hit Die to deal an extra 3d6 necrotic damage.

Curse: This weapon is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the weapon or you attune to it. Attuning to the dagger curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic; disposing of the dagger fails to end the curse. While cursed, whenever you receive magical healing, you must spend 1 Hit Die to regain any hit points. If you spend all your Hit Dice at any point, you die.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

A keyhole sealed in this way can't be unlocked until this dagger is placed into that keyhole once more (though a sealed door or container can still be broken, bypassing the lock).

    <text>This dull-blue river stone is soft to the touch, and makes remarkably little sound if dropped. When an echo stone is squeezed as an action, it glows faintly for 1 minute. The stone records all sound made within 15 feet of it while glowing, then repeats that recorded sound at an equal volume once every 5 minutes. This cycle of repetition continues until the stone is squeezed again as an action, which silences it. Squeezing the stone twice in quick succession as an action causes it to play the sounds it has most recently recorded, rather than recording new sounds.

    <text>This blade appears to be a beautiful cruciform sword of shining silver, inlaid with sparkling rubies. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the following properties.

Corrosive Submission: When you hit a creature that has an Intelligence score of 4 or higher with an attack using this sword, the target takes an extra 3d6 acid damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 hour. If you attack the creature again while it is charmed in this way, the extra acid damage increases to 10d6 and the charmed condition ends. If the target succeeds on its saving throw or the charm ends for it, it can't be charmed again in this way for 24 hours.

Hidden Nature: The acid damage dealt by this greatsword appears to be radiant damage to all who perceive it. A true seeing spell or similar magic reveals that the sword is actually a rusted, pitted blade dripping with acid.

Sentience: Graz'tchar is a sentient neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
	The sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Anyone who holds it hears the wise voice of a sorrowful king, beckoning the user to seize their destiny. A creature that succeeds on a DC 26 Wisdom (Insight) check while listening to the blade's voice hears a sliver of malice that suggests the truth: the voice is a corrupting trick of the Demon Prince of Indulgence.

Personality: Graz'tchar slowly attempts to sway its wielder to sow chaos in Exandria, telling lies and spreading malign truths about great leaders, and claiming that the members of the Tal'Dorei Council are corrupt and must be overthrown. The voice of this blade is actually the Demon Prince of Indulgence, speaking from his Abyssal prison.
	If the sword's attuned wielder disobeys the urges of the weapon for an extended period of time, Graz'tchar can attempt to control the wielder, who must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or become charmed by the sword for 24 hours. While the wielder is charmed in this way, the sword can compel them to take an action of the sword's choice once per hour, though the wielder believes this action is taken of their own free will. If the chosen action leads to the harm of someone the wielder considers a trusted friend or ally, the charmed condition immediately ends. On a successful saving throw or if the charmed condition ends for the wielder, they are immune to this property of the sword for 24 hours.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: martial, greatsword

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has a reach of 20 feet. When you hit a creature or object using this whip, you can attempt to grapple the target as a bonus action.
	While you have a creature grappled using this whip, you can use your action to either pull the creature up to 20 feet toward you, or cause the creature to be restrained until you let go of the whip. A creature restrained in this way can escape by making a successful Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check as an action. The DC of this check equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

	If you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can cast the dispel magic spell from the sword against the target as part of the attack. Alternatively, you can use an action to cast dispel magic from the sword against a target of your choice. If you need to make a check with your spellcasting ability modifier as part of casting the spell, you make this check with a +3 modifier or your own spellcasting ability modifier, whichever is higher.
	Once you cast dispel magic using this weapon, you can't do so again until the next dawn.

    <text>These silver hand mirrors always come in pairs. When activated as an action, a mirror establishes a visual link with its paired mirror for 10 minutes, with the two mirrors acting as opposite sides of the same open window. The mirrors create this connection even if both are on different planes.
	When a single mirror of infinite transpondence is found, the GM decides where its paired mirror is and who possesses it. A random possessor and location can be determined by rolling on the table below. Named bearers are described in chapter 2.

Mirror Locations:
d8 | Location | Possessor
1 | Emon | Seeker Odessa Tal'Dorei
2 | Whitestone | None; the mirror is in an empty dungeon
3 | Kymal | Sylker "The Millionaire" Uttolot
4 | Westruun | Realmseer Eskil Ryndarien
5 | Syngorn | Ouestra, the Voice of Memory
6 | The Elemental Plane of Water | Khedive Xundi, Lord of Silver Silt
7 | The Plane of Shadow | A Remnant chosen (see page 251)
8 | An untraceable location | The Wonderworker

Once the connection between the two mirrors has been activated three times from either end, it can't be activated again until the next dawn.

On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped within the crystal. A creature that wants to be trapped can intentionally fail this saving throw.
	Only one creature at a time can be held in a raven's slumber. That creature is aware of the passage of time and can see the world outside of this talisman as if through a window. You can release a held creature to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a bonus action.
	If a companion creature granted to you by a class feature, or a beast that you've tamed as a companion, is reduced to 0 hit points while within 100 feet of you, it is immediately drawn into the pendant and stabilized. If the pendant already holds a creature, this effect fails.

	When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, you can immediately make another attack with this weapon after resolving the critical hit. When you roll a 1 on an attack roll made with this weapon, you must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage as some of its gears and wires spring loose.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons"). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

    <text>An earthboard is a slab of granite about three inches thick, nine feet long, and two feet wide, with smooth, tapered ends. However, its mundane appearance belies its unique elemental power, which reduces its weight to 40 pounds while a creature is attuned to it. The Earth Ashari of Terrah can often be seen with these stone boards upon their backs as they trek into the crags of the Cliffkeep Mountains.
	While standing on an earthboard, you gain the following benefits:

	• Your speed increases to 60 feet as the board skims across solid ground (but not liquid surfaces).

	• If you ramp off a surface of solid earth, you can long jump up to 60 feet. When you end this jump, you can choose to slam into the ground, creating a shockwave. Each creature standing on the ground within 20 feet of you must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or fall prone.

	• You have a burrowing speed of 20 feet that allows you to tunnel through earth or solid rock, leaving a 5-foot diameter tunnel in your wake. As an action, you can increase this burrowing speed to 60 feet until the start of your next turn.

	• The earthboard always moves with you until you decide to dismount it (no action required).

These benefits last until you end your turn not standing on the earthboard.

Light and Flame: While attuned to the lantern, you can verbally ask the elemental to glow (no action required), causing the lantern to cast bright light in a radius of your choice up to 60 feet and dim light for the same distance beyond that. You can also cast the produce flame cantrip from the lantern at will. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

Elemental Essence: The fire elemental spirit in the lantern can grant you a small fragment of its power. As an action, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice for 1 hour:

	• You have resistance to fire damage.

	• Whenever a creature hits you with a melee attack, that creature takes fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

	• You can cast the burning hands spell (spell save DC 15) from the lantern at 3rd level. Once you cast the spell, you can't do so again until the next time you use this property of the lantern.

Once the elemental has shared its power with you in this way, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

Willful Attunement: Your attunement to the lantern lasts until you choose to end it, or until you anger the elemental (by dousing the lantern in water, attacking another nonhostile elemental being, and so forth). You can attempt to attune to the lantern again and repeat the check to bond with the elemental during a short or long rest, but you make this check with disadvantage until you have made amends to the spirit, as the GM determines.

	While these wings are open and you are riding the skysail, you can glide through the air. You have a flying speed of 60 feet, but you must descend at least 10 feet by the end of each of your turns and you can't gain altitude.
	Additionally, while in contact with the skysail, you can use an action to cast the fly spell on yourself, with a duration of 1 minute and requiring no concentration. The spell ends if you lose physical contact with the skysail. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn, or unless the skysail is immersed in powerful magic of elemental air. (This includes magic such as that found at the top of the Summit Peaks near the rift of air in Zephrah, or on the Elemental Plane of Air).
	When the skysail is not in use, its wings can be retracted, and its pole can be used as a quarterstaff.

Whenever you damage a creature with Agony, that creature is marked for 10 minutes or until you damage a different creature. When you hit a creature marked in this way with this weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 piercing damage.

Awakened: When Agony reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

	• The extra damage when you hit a marked creature increases to 1d8.
	• A marked creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws.
	• When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an attack using Agony, you can immediately make an additional melee attack with this weapon as a bonus action.

    <text>This cloak is made of heavy dark cloth trimmed with golden patterns, and occasionally shimmers with sparks of arcane energy. It was once worn by the famed gunslinger Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III of Whitestone.

Dormant: While Cabal's Ruin is in a dormant state, the cloak has 4 charges and it regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit with an attack, you can expend any number of charges from the cloak, with the attack dealing an extra 1d6 lightning damage per charge expended. If your attack strikes multiple targets, you choose one target that takes this extra damage.
	When you are targeted by an enemy's spell, you can use your reaction to absorb a portion of the spell's energy into the cloak.

This shadow-touched hand crossbow once served as the weapon of choice for the legendary assassin Todora. Though few know this, Condemner is now in the possession of an equally infamous assassin named Ixrattu Khar.

Dormant: When Condemner is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra 1d4 poison damage.
	Additionally, if you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can activate one of the following effects instead of dealing damage:

	• You cast fog cloud centered on the target's space.
	• You cast silence centered on the target's space. When an effect is used, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

Awakened: When Condemner reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

	• The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.
	• The extra poison damage dealt by the weapon increases to 1d6.
	• You gain an additional effect that can be triggered in place of dealing damage when you hit with an attack: You cast hold person on the target (save DC 15). This effect can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

Exalted: When Condemner reaches an exalted state, you gain the following benefits:

	• The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.

	• You gain an additional effect that can be triggered in place of damage when you hit with an attack: You cast the blight spell on the target (save DC 17). This effect can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons"). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    <text>The thick, grooved blade of this shining silver longsword is lined with etched runes that sparkle blue in the light. Star Razor—known also as Dwueth'var—was thought to have been destroyed or lost after the Calamity, but new rumors suggest that it might be wielded by a half-orc somewhere in Wildemount.

Dormant: While Star Razor is in a dormant state, you can hold this magic longsword and use a bonus action to speak the command word Galasvar, causing the sword to emit a pale blue glow that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. This glow lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again, or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

	• While this longsword is glowing, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon, and you have resistance to radiant damage.

	• You can cast the faerie fire spell from the weapon as an action, requiring no components (save DC 13). Once a spell has been cast using Star Razor, that spell can't be cast from the sword until the next dawn.

Awakened: Then Star Razor reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

	• The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.
	• When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to create a burst of radiance from the sword, dealing 1d8 radiant damage to the attacker.
	• You can cast the see invisibility spell from the sword as an action, and the save DC for spells cast using the sword increases to 15.

Exalted:  When Star Razor reaches an exalted state, you gain the following benefits:

	• The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.
	• The burst of radiance you can create as a reaction when hit with a melee attack deals 1d12 radiant damage, and you can immediately teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you as part of the same reaction.
	• You can cast the fly spell from the sword as an action, and the save DC for spells cast using the sword increases to 17.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Proficiency: martial, longsword

    <text>Forged with a mercurial metal accidentally drawn from the Realms Beyond, this dagger shimmers with an unsettling sourceless light. It was once wielded by Vax'ildan, a legendary champion of the Matron of Ravens. Two raven feathers are linked to its pommel as a memento of its former bearer.

Dormant: While Whisper is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
	Additionally, when you score a critical hit with this dagger, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. On a success, the target is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

Awakened: When Whisper reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

	• The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2. Additionally, when you hit with an attack using this dagger, the target takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage.

	• The DC to resist being frightened from a critical hit increases to 15.

Exalted: When Whisper reaches an exalted state, you gain the following benefits:

	• The DC to resist being frightened from a critical hit increases to 17.
	• When this dagger is used to make a ranged attack, you can choose to transform into shadow and merge with the blade as part of the action used to attack, teleporting to another location. If the attack hits, you appear in an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of the target. If the attack misses, you appear where the GM determines the dagger lands (typically within 1d6 × 5 feet of the target). In either case, you appear with the dagger in your hand.
