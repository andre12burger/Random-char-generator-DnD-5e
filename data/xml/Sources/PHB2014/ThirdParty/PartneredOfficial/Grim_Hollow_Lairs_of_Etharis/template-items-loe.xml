    <text>Made from the claws, teeth, and bones of lycanthropes, these weapons are particularly effective against other lycanthropes or vampires. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
	Additionally, on a successful attack against a lycanthrope, the target is forced back into its human form unless it succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. Also, damage done to vampires with lycan weapons cannot be regenerated until the creature finishes a short rest.</text>
