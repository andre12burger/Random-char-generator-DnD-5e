    <text>The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you're an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you're not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you're worthy to wield it.

Made from the claws, teeth, and bones of lycanthropes, these weapons are particularly effective against other lycanthropes or vampires. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
	Additionally, on a successful attack against a lycanthrope, the target is forced back into its human form unless it succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. Also, damage done to vampires with lycan weapons cannot be regenerated until the creature finishes a short rest.

Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: martial, double-bladed scimitar
