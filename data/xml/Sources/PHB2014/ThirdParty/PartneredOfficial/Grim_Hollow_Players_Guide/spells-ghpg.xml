    <text>You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into wood. If the target's body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden into bark. On a successful save, the creature isn't affected.
	A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its Constitution saving throw three times, it is turned into a tree and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.
	If the transformed creature is burned, chopped down, or otherwise destroyed while petrified, the creature is slain.
	A creature remains transformed unless the effect is reversed within one year with greater restoration, wish, or similar magical effects. If the creature spends one year and a day as a tree, the transformation becomes permanent, and nothing can return the creature to its original form.

    <text>As part of casting this spell, you must expend three hit dice or the spell automatically fails. If you do, roll the expended hit dice, and the creature gains an equal number of temporary hit points.
	For the duration of the spell, you know the direction and distance to the creature at all times, you and the creature can speak to one another telepathically (provided the creature has an intelligence score of 3 or higher), and you can target the creature with spells you cast that have a range of Self or Touch. These benefits are suppressed while you and the creature are not on the same plane.
	At any point, a creature affected by this spell can choose to end the spell early. If it does, the creature loses all remaining temporary hit points granted by this spell and takes necrotic damage equal to the temporary hit points lost.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th or 6th level, its duration is 8 hours. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, its duration is 24 hours. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, its duration is 7 days.

    <text>You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, the next creature hit by the weapon must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive a festering wound. A creature with a festering wound takes 2d6 necrotic damage at the beginning of its turn for the remainder of the spell's duration. A creature can only have one festering wound at a time.
	Receiving at least 1 point of magical healing closes a festering wound, ending the recurring damage and the spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can increase the damage dealt by a festering wound by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

A crimson pillar erupts from the ground in a 15-foot radius and 100-foot high cylinder centered on the point you chose. Each creature within the cylinder must make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to the total of the expended hit dice. On a failure, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to the total of the expended hit dice and must expend and roll four hit dice of its own, taking additional necrotic damage equal to the result.
	For each creature who fails the saving throw against this spell, you gain 5 temporary hit points.

	Until the spell ends, you can attempt to recall any important fact known to the creature — family history, recent events, building layouts, passwords, details of the creature's death, and similar information. To recall a piece of information, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting modifier. The DC is equal to the corpse's Intelligence score.
	Once the caster rolls to determine whether they recall a fact, they cannot attempt to recall it again.

When you do, roll the eight hit dice expended to cast this spell and total them to determine the creature's creeping death threshold. While the spell remains active, if the creature's current hit points ever equal or are less than the creeping death threshold, the creature immediately dies.
	As a bonus action on each of your turns while this spell is active, you can force the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, roll 2d6 and add the result to the creature's creeping death threshold. On a success, add half the result instead. If the creature succeeds on three saving throws, which do not have to be consecutive, this spell ends early.

	This magic weapon lasts until the spell ends. It counts as a simple weapon with which you are proficient, and it has the light, finesse, and reach properties. You can choose to add your spellcasting modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, to attack and damage rolls with this weapon. Its damage die is equivalent to the hit die expended casting this spell, and the damage dealt is necrotic. Each time a creature takes damage from this magic weapon, its maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the damage it took.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, when you take the Attack action, you can make two weapon attacks, provided both are with this magic weapon. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, when you take the Attack action you make three weapon attacks, provided all are with this magic weapon.

If you do, make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet using the material component of this spell. On a hit, roll the hit dice expended casting this spell plus an additional 4d8 and deal necrotic damage equal to the result. If this damage causes the creature to be reduced to 0 hit points, it immediately dies and you gain one of the following dark blessings of your choice.

Unassailable: You have advantage on all saving throws.

Unbreakable: Your size increases by one category (from Medium to Large, for example), you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) at the start of each of your turns, and your weapon attacks deal an additional 1d4 damage.

Unerring: Your proficiency bonus increases by 2.

Your dark blessing ends after 10 minutes or when you are reduced to 0 hit points, whichever happens first. When you take radiant damage while you have a dark blessing, you take an additional 1d4 damage.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the melee spell attack damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and it takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of your turns.
	Each round on its turn, a creature trapped within the worm can use an action to attempt to repeat the Dexterity saving throw to escape. A creature that succeeds this saving throw is regurgitated and falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the worm.

The spell ends early if you are reduced to 0 hit points as a ghost or you use an action to do so. If the material component used to cast this spell remains on your corpse, you return to life with current hit points equal to half your maximum hit points. If the material component used to cast this spell is no longer on your corpse, you must make death saving throws as normal.
	If your body is destroyed or damaged beyond the capacity to survive while you are under the effects of this spell, its duration becomes indefinite and you remain a ghost until you are reduced to 0 hit points, destroyed by any other effect, or your body is targeted by an effect that returns the living to the dead such as raise dead or resurrection.

As part of casting this spell, you must expend nine hit dice or the spell automatically fails. If you do, roll the expended hit dice and note the total as your "mortal hit points," then the creature who triggered this spell by being reduced to 0 hp immediately dies. If it would normally return to its native plane at 0 hp, it is destroyed instead. Change your creature type to that of the dead creature.
	Whilst changed, you are immune to poison and disease; no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe; resistant to nonmagical damage; and gain a benefit dependent on your new creature type:

Celestial: You have resistance to radiant and necrotic damage and gain a fly speed of 60 feet.

Elemental: You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage.

Fey: You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to turn invisible until the start of your next turn or teleport up to 60 feet in any direction.

Fiend: You have resistance to cold and fire damage and gain a fly speed of 60 feet.

Your creature type is retained until you cast the spell again, immediately ending its effects, or you take damage that reduces you to 0 hp, wherein your creature type returns to normal and your hp to the number noted as your mortal hit points.
