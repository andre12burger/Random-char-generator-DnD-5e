    <text>Unarmed: When you make an unarmed attack you can choose to deal the damage of this weapon instead of your normal unarmed attack damage.

Made from the claws, teeth, and bones of lycanthropes, these weapons are particularly effective against other lycanthropes or vampires. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
	Additionally, on a successful attack against a lycanthrope, the target is forced back into its human form unless it succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. Also, damage done to vampires with lycan weapons cannot be regenerated until the creature finishes a short rest.

Proficiency: simple, knuckles
