    <text>Unarmed: When you make an unarmed attack you can choose to deal the damage of this weapon instead of your normal unarmed attack damage.

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When this weapon reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature doesn't die. Instead, infernal runes appear as if carved into their flesh and they're healed to 1 hit point. They now have the paralyzed condition until the condition is removed by a Lesser Restoration spell or similar magic. When the condition is removed, the runes disappear. At the start of each of their turns while they're paralyzed, the creature suffers immense pain and gains a level of exhaustion.

Proficiency: simple, knuckles
