    <text>A beautiful onyx pendant, the Gift of Graz'zt is bestowed by the Dark Prince upon those who have earned his favor or captured his attention. The Gift is attuned by wearing the pendant as a necklace. The Gift only bestows its powers on the entity Graz'zt gave it to. If anyone else attunes it, it becomes the Curse of Graz'zt.

Once per day as an action the pendant can be caressed, summoning one or more fiendish servants who appear in unoccupied spaces you can see within 60 feet. The summoned demons disappear after one hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. The summoned demons are friendly to the summoner, and have a telepathic link to the summoner. They unquestioningly obey verbal and telepathic commands that are issued to them (no action required by the summoner). If no commands are issued they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

The demons summoned are determined randomly. Roll 1d6 to determine the type of demon or demons that appear.

Demon Table:
1 | 2d4 Dretch
2 | 2d4 Manes
3 | 1d2 Shadow Demons
4 | 1 Barlugura
5 | 1 Chasme
6 | 1 Vrock

Curse of Graz'zt:
Should anyone other than the original Gift recipient attune the Gift, it becomes cursed. It cannot be removed from the neck by any means other than a remove curse, wish, or Divine Intervention. Only a wish can allow the Gift to be used by an unintended recipient.

Once per day, at midnight, the Curse of Graz'zt automatically summons demons, per the chart above, who are immediately hostile to the wearer, doing everything in their power to slaughter the wearer, and then any other living creature nearby, for one hour.
