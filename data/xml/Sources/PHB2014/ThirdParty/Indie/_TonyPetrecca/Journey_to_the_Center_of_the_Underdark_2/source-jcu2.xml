Are your player's going fishing in the Underdark? Booked a ride with the Kua Toa Travel Agency? Taking a cruise on the Darklake? Well then Journey Through the Center of the Underdark 2 - The Darklake Strikes Back is just what the Leemooggoogon ordered!

Like the first Journey, The Darklake Strikes Back contains several encounters designed with Out of the Abyss traveling days in mind, but easily inserted into any 5th Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons Underdark setting.

Unlike the first Journey, The Darklake Strikes Back has a mid sized three level dynamically defended dungeon, complete with a dragon at the bottom! This complex is right at home on the Darklake but could also readily be inserted into your Tyranny of Dragons campaign as well.

Written for a party of characters levels 4-6 with notes included for adjusting encounter difficulties for lower or higher level groups Journey Through the Center of the Underdark 2 - The Darklake Strikes Back should provide 6-10 hours of gameplay excitement!

The Darklake Strikes Back includes:

	• Three mini encounters on the Darklake ready to insert into any Underdark setting PLUS
	• One three level island fortress and dungeon ready to insert into any setting
	• Very Young and Juvenile Black Dragon stats excerpted from Dragons! Volume 1 - Chromatic Dragons
	• Five new magic items including a new artifact
	• Four full color maps
	• Over a dozen illustrations from top industry artists
	• And 6-10 hours of gameplay</description>
