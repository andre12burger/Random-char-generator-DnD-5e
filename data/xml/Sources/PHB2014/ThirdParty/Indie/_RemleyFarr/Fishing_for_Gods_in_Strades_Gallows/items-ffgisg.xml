    <text>Locked away in the armory of Fort Strade is this white staff inlayed with swirling, green designs.
	You gain +1 on attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, as well as the following additional properties.

Fey Hate: Whenever you attack a creature with the fey creature type, you gain an advantage on attack rolls. Also, you gain advantage on any skill checks involving fey creatures.

Scorned Lover: Touching this weapon forces you to make a Charisma save DC 15. On a failure, you hear nothing but agonizing screams and take 1d4 psychic damage per round as long as you hold Gerald the Hatestick. A new save can be made each round. On a success, you can communicate with Gerald the Hatestick normally. No further Charisma saves need to be made by the party after the first successful save.

Sentience: Gerald the Hatestick is a sentient, neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It cannot see or hear, but can communicate as long as it's being held. Its voice is that of an angry old man, and it only speaks common and draconic.

Personality: The staff is a sentient item, created by Tashtiba for a mage named Gerald who lived at Fort Strade. Tashtiba enticed Gerald to love her, but Gerald scorned her when he found out she was really an ugly hag. Tashtiba crafted the staff as a "no hard feelings" present for him, but the staff killed Gerald upon his touching it, trapping his soul inside.
	Gerald is a bit aloof and confused now that he's trapped in a quarterstaff. He will shout obscenities at enemies, especially other fey, so the party might have to help him come to terms with Shae. He knows lots of information about hags, Tashtiba, and Fort Strade, so he can offer valuable insight to the party's adventure.

Versatile: A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Proficiency: simple, quarterstaff

    <text>This glass bottle contains a Water Wyrd (Monster Manual, pg. 299). It was crafted by Tashtiba to be used in her freak show during the Harvest Fest.
	The item has one use. It can be activated by pulling the stopper or smashing it, which makes the water wyrd emerge. The water wyrd is chaotic evil and will attack anything nearby. After one minute, the water wyrd will fizzle away into a puddle of foam.
