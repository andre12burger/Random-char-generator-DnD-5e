    <text>A yklwa (pronounced YICK-ul-wah) is a simple melee weapon that is the traditional weapon of Chultan warriors. A yklwa consists of a 3-foot wooden shaft with a steel or stone blade up to 18 inches long. Although it has the thrown weapon property, the yklwa is not well balanced for throwing.

When you roll a 1 or a 20 on a d20, roll another d20 to create a random effect. Each time you roll, the new effect replaces any previous effect. Unless otherwise stated, the weapon returns to its normal state when you finish a short or long rest.

Chaos Weapon Effects:
d20 | Effect
1 | Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.
2 | A spectral aura coats your weapon. Until the end of your next turn, whenever you hit with this weapon, it casts magic missile as a 1st-level spell.
3 | Until the end of your next turn, you have advantage on attack rolls with this weapon.
4 | You and all creatures within 30 feet of you gain vulnerability to slashing damage for the next minute.
5 | Your attacks with this weapon deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage.
6 | Your weapon casts entangle on the next creature you hit with it before the end of your next turn.
7 | Instead of rolling, treat the result of this weapon's damage dice as 1 until the end of your next turn.
8 | You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
9 | You gain a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
10 | You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

13 | You gain a -3 penalty to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
14 | Instead of rolling, treat the result of this weapon's damage dice as the maximum result until the end of your next turn.

16 | Your attacks with this weapon deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage.
17 | You and all creatures within 30 feet of you gain vulnerability to bludgeoning damage for the next minute.
18 | You are surrounded by a faint, ethereal music for the next minute.
19 | A glorious blaze flashes across your weapon, then vanishes. Immediately after, your weapon casts fireball as a 3rd-level spell, centered on yourself.
20 | Roll twice on this table, gaining both effects.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, yklwa
