        <name>Primal Path: Path of Sacred Kin (HB)</name>
        <text>As in all civilizations, stories of life's origin are intertwined with the path of mythical beings consorting among them out of grand purpose or boredom. These stories, told since the first sunrise, act as guiding parables when a tribe or people faces a crucial juncture in their fate. They tell of times of great peril, when a powerful individual emerges from their number, led by a forbear's spirit, to lead them to their destiny—for good or ill. The circumstances surrounding the event could be as simple as the death of a clan's chieftain, as great as the threat of slavery, or even extinction.
	With most tribes, the elders are aware of a spirit's affinity to their people but other times they are just as surprised by the mark themselves. When the gift manifests itself it is easily recognized often celebrated. There are instances, however, when it is perceived as an omen.
	In battle, your ancestor's spirit courses through you, imbuing your frenzy with the supernatural fury of the spirit, be they celestial, demonic, draconic, or even aberrant in nature.

        <name>Spellcasting (Path of Sacred Kin (HB))</name>
        <text>When you reach 3rd level, you channel your ancient blood to harness the power of your forbearer. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.

Cantrips:
You learn three cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Sacred Kin Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell feather fall and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast feather fall with either slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
You know three 1st-level sorcerer spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the divination or transmutation spells on the sorcerer spell list.
	The Spells Known column of the Sacred Kin Spellcasting table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be a divination or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
	The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic on the sorcerer's spell list.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the sorcerer spells you know with another spell of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a divination or transmutation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.

Spellcasting Ability:
Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to harness the magic in your blood. You use your Constitution whenever a spell refers to your spell casting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast or when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

        <name>Ancestral Origins (Path of Sacred Kin (HB))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, when you choose this path, you choose the origin of your ancestor, either aberrant, celestial, or demonic. The damage types associated with your origin are used by features you gain later.
	You can speak, read, and write the language of your ancestor and can weave their curses and oaths into your battle-cries. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with a creature of your ancestors' type, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

Ancestral Origin:
Ancestor | Damage Type | Language
Aberrant | Psychic or Force | Deep Speech
Celestial | Thunder or Radiant | Celestial

        <name>Supernatural Fury (Path of Sacred Kin (HB))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you can focus on the magic in your blood, allowing you to concentrate your rage into the ancient magic of your bloodline and enter a Supernatural Fury. You gain the ability to cast and concentrate on spells, even while raging, at the expense of your physical resistances.
	When you enter your Supernatural Fury and you aren't wearing heavy armor, the following benefits replace the benefits of the Rage feature:

	• You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of +1).

	• You have advantage on Constitution checks and saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell.

	• You have resistance to damage from spells and other magical effects.

Your Supernatural Fury lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you're knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature, cast a spell, or taken damage since your last turn. You can end your Supernatural Fury on your turn as a bonus action.

You gain two of the metamagic options of your choice from the sorcerer's list of available options. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.
	You can use only one metamagic option when you cast a spell, unless otherwise noted.

	At 14th level, weapon attacks with this feature ignore resistance to this damage, but not immunity.

        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Courageous Heart (HB)</name>
        <text>For some adventurers, their internal reservoir of fearlessness and gallantry might border closer to foolhardiness. An intrepid do-gooder might take the first step down this path by complete accident, meddling in affairs they ought not and finding themselves unable to turn back. Their impromptu effectiveness in battle isn't due to anger but rather matching pluck, tenacity, or stubbornness to shrug off the worst the enemy has to offer.
	These brawlers might not be as graceful as trained fighters, but they're guardians of the weak, and what they lack in polish they make up for in valor.

Inspiring. Your inspiring last stand fills your allies with renewed vigor. Allies within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you gain 10 temporary hit points.

        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Red Reaver (HB)</name>
        <text>The Path of the Red Reaver is a warrior's hunt for meaning in a life borne of suffering and violence, not some ritualistic process for raiding cannibals as inexperienced adventurers might have you believe. The barbarians that follow this path fuel their rage with this pursuit of purpose. For those that live long enough, their discipline becomes almost monk-like in its meditation, chasing their sense of self through the arteries of those they deem worthy in battle.
	As wizards live to slake their thirst for knowledge, barbarians who follow the Path of Red Reaver are usually drawn to the greatest challenge in the field, not for bragging rights, or even to turn the tide of battle, but to further discern their place in the veins of their world.

        <name>Devouring Rage (Path of the Red Reaver (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your thirst for blood channels the life-force of your foes to sustain you. When you're raging and below half of your hit point maximum, at the start of your turn you can enter a devouring rage by expending any number of Hit Dice as a bonus action. For the duration of your rage, your weapons become magical for the purpose of overcoming damage resistances and immunities, and on a hit, you regain a number of hit points equal to 1 plus the number of Hit Dice you spent. On a critical hit, you restore twice that amount of hit points.
	Your target must have blood in order for you to regain hit points from an attack.
	At the beginning of each turn, if you haven't hit a hostile creature since your last turn, you suffer damage equal to the number you would regain on a hit but retain your devouring rage and its features.
	Your devouring rage ends once you reach your hit point maximum or you exit your Rage, whichever happens first.

        <name>Sanguine Scent (Path of the Red Reaver (HB))</name>
        <text>Also at 3rd level, your senses become preternaturally attuned to the scent of blood. As an action on your turn, you can draw a deep breath to immediately track the scent of creatures around you. For the next 10 minutes, you're able to smell the approximate number of living creatures within 60 feet of you. You can differentiate the type but not the identity of any specific creature.
	If you know the creature you're looking for and have access to one of its possessions, you can focus solely on that target. While focused, you can't use this feature to detect any other creature but your quarry. When you would make a Wisdom (Survival) check to track your quarry, the creature instead makes a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. On a failure, you learn the direction and approximate distance to that creature, and are able to follow its scent even through terrain that would normally cover its scent, like running water.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses. You must be able to breathe in order to use this feature.

The range of your Sanguine Scent is increased to 120 feet and you no longer need access to a creature's possessions to track it if you have spent at least 5 minutes within 30 feet of your target within the last 24 hours.
	Additionally, you can spend 1 Hit Die to learn the exact number and general location of creatures in the area or, when focused on a single target, impose disadvantage on your target's saving throw against being tracked by you and the range of your tracking ability becomes 5 miles for that creature.

While your current hit point total is at least half of your hit point maximum, you can expend any number of Hit Dice as an action to heal an equal number living creatures other than you within 10 feet of you. On your turn, roll 1 Hit Die for each creature you target with this feature. The creature regains a number of hit points equal to the result + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).
