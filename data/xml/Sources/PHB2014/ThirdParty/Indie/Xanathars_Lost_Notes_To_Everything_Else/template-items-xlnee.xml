    <text>Made from the wood of yew trees charred by lighting, this heavy crossbow is studded with hearts carved of rose zircon. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the crossbow. Before shooting the crossbow you may turn a nonmagical bolt loaded in the weapon into a healing bolt as no action. If you don't use the bolt within an hour after converting it, it reverts back into a normal bolt. When struck with a healing bolt the target takes damage as normal and then heals a number of hit points equal to 4d10 + 4. You can't shoot another healing bolt from the crossbow until you complete a short or long rest.</text>
