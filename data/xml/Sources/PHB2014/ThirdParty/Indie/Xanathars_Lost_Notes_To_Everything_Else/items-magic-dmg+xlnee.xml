When you roll a 1 or a 20 on a d20, roll another d20 to create a random effect. Each time you roll, the new effect replaces any previous effect. Unless otherwise stated, the weapon returns to its normal state when you finish a short or long rest.

Chaos Weapon Effects:
d20 | Effect
1 | Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.
2 | A spectral aura coats your weapon. Until the end of your next turn, whenever you hit with this weapon, it casts magic missile as a 1st-level spell.
3 | Until the end of your next turn, you have advantage on attack rolls with this weapon.
4 | You and all creatures within 30 feet of you gain vulnerability to slashing damage for the next minute.
5 | Your attacks with this weapon deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage.
6 | Your weapon casts entangle on the next creature you hit with it before the end of your next turn.
7 | Instead of rolling, treat the result of this weapon's damage dice as 1 until the end of your next turn.
8 | You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
9 | You gain a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
10 | You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
11 | You gain a -1 penalty to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
12 | You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
13 | You gain a -3 penalty to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
14 | Instead of rolling, treat the result of this weapon's damage dice as the maximum result until the end of your next turn.
15 | You and all creatures within 30 feet of you gain vulnerability to piercing damage for the next minute.
16 | Your attacks with this weapon deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage.
17 | You and all creatures within 30 feet of you gain vulnerability to bludgeoning damage for the next minute.
18 | You are surrounded by a faint, ethereal music for the next minute.
19 | A glorious blaze flashes across your weapon, then vanishes. Immediately after, your weapon casts fireball as a 3rd-level spell, centered on yourself.
20 | Roll twice on this table, gaining both effects.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

A two handed ranged weapon that fires bullets.

When you roll a 1 or a 20 on a d20, roll another d20 to create a random effect. Each time you roll, the new effect replaces any previous effect. Unless otherwise stated, the weapon returns to its normal state when you finish a short or long rest.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers.

You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.
