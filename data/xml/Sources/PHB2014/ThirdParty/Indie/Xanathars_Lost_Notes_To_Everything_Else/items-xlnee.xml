    <text>This mithral longsword is of elven design, bearing runes along the blade that read "Arelind", an ancient elven word that means "Champion of the People". These blades were often gifts given by elven wizards to non-elven allies of great esteem.
	You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. It sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius when unsheathed. You can speak, read, and write Elvish so long as the sword is on your person.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Proficiency: martial, longsword

    <text>This appears to be a simple, unassuming black leather belt when wrapped around the user's waist. When removed, a small diamond can be seen stitched into the belt's underside. Each time this belt is buckled, it sounds like a sword being drawn from a sheath. As part of an attack, you can draw a hidden +2 dagger from the belt. If the dagger leaves your hands it ceases to exist at the end of your turn. The belt doesn't run out of daggers. You must be wearing the belt to use this property.

    <text>This metal belt is made of silver monkeys locked arm in arm with tiny pieces of jade for each primate's eyes. While wearing it, you feel the tickling urge to treat the world as a playground by swinging on objects, climbing trees, and scaling buildings. While wearing this belt, you add double your proficiency to Strength (Athletics) checks to climb.
	As an action, any tail you have becomes prehensile for an hour. If you don't have a tail, you grow a 3-foot prehensile tail out of your posterior for an hour. You can hang from your tail, provided it has something to hold onto. Your tail also acts as a third arm and hand, allowing you to manipulate and wield objects that weigh 5 lbs. or less. In this state you could hold three weapons at once, but you can still only fight with two at a time. You can't use this ability again until you have completed a long rest.

A stiff but bendable chain makes up the curvature of this longbow. Each link of chain has a small pink pearl in the center. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage roll made with this longbow. When you shoot a creature with a flying speed with this bow, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its flying speed reduced by 10 feet. The target must complete a short rest before it can regain any speed lost in this way.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>These plain boxes are carved with Dwarvish runes, surprisingly light, and roughly the size of a loaf of bread. Inside, the box is much more extravagant, lined with crushed velvet and studded with gems. An old dwarf nursery rhyme plays when the box is open. "The Legend of Calibra Daliq" is about a dwarf wizard thief who shrunk herself to sneak past guards and locked doors in order to get her riches.

The DM either rolls to determine the box's type or chooses one from the options available.

Box of Shrinking Type:
d100 | Metal | Original object space | Rarity
01-50 | Iron | 5-ft cube or smaller | Uncommon
51-80 | Steel | 10-ft cube or smaller | Rare
81-95 | Mithral | 15-ft cube or smaller | Very Rare
96-100 | Adamantine | 20-ft cube or smaller | Legendary

You can use the box of shrinking's Grow and Shrink abilities once per day each. You must be holding the box to use either ability.

Grow: As an action, any item previously shrunken by a box of shrinking of equal or lesser rarity and power may be grown. The item must be placed in the box of shrinking and its original size must be within the parameters on the table above. Once the command word is spoken the object appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the box of shrinking. You must be holding the box of shrinking to use this ability.

Shrink: As an action you may speak a command word and one non-living object within 50 feet of the box of shrinking has its size reduced to a 1-inch cube, weighs half a pound, and is teleported into the box. The item stays this size until it is grown by a box of shrinking. The shrunken item may be no larger than specified on the table above.

    <text>While holding this scimitar, you can use a bonus action to activate its brambles. When you do, several barbed vines coil around its crossguard, over your wrist, and dig into your flesh. At the start of each of your turns, it drains 2 hit points from you to empower its poison. While attached to you in this way, you can't be disarmed by normal means, and you are resistant to poison damage and immune to the poisoned condition. Each time the weapon drains your hit points, it gains one charge, to a maximum of 5 charges. The weapon continues to drain your hit points while fully charged.
	On a hit, its vicious barbs lash out from the scimitar and rake your target with venomous brambles, expending all charges within its vines. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus. On a failure, the creature takes 1d4 poison damage for each charge spent.
	If you stow the weapon without expending all of its charges, the poison courses through your veins as you release the hilt and you must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take the damage from its thorns for each remaining charge.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

	When wielding this weapon, you can spend a bonus action to activate the weapon's special feature, extending the range of existing shadows surrounding you. You and any creature within 5 feet of you gains advantage to Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in dim light. This effect lasts for 1 minute and doesn't work in complete darkness. Once this effect is used, a long rest must be completed before it can be used again.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

While holding the flail of force you can use your action to spin the flail very quickly creating a small wall of force per the spell adjacent to you.

    <text>This black net is adorned with skulls carved of ruby and shrieks when thrown. When you hit a target with the net you speak a command word that turns the net into a twisting iron cage for 1 hour. While transformed this way the DC for the Strength check to break free of the net rises to 18, the iron net has AC 15, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Once you have used this ability you can't use it again until dawn the next day. If the net is destroyed, it reforms in 24 hours.

Special: A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

If the item is held by another creature, roll a Dexterity check contested by the creature's opposing Strength check. If your Dexterity check is greater, you remove the object and drag it to you.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon.
	When a wielder attuned to this longbow slays a creature with an arrow shot from it, the soul of the creature it killed is trapped within the mahogany, runescored bow. The creature killed in this manner can't be resurrected. As a bonus action, the wielder can transfer the soul trapped into the bow into an arrow is it is fired. Such an arrow attacks with advantage and does an extra 3d6 necrotic damage on a hit. Once a soul leaves the bow, another can't enter the bow for a full 24 hours.
	If the wielder attuned to the longbow of lost souls dies while within 10 feet of the bow, the wielder's soul enters the bow instead. The wielder can't be returned to life until the bow is attuned to a new wielder, and then an arrow can be fired to release the soul.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon.

    <text>These fine green, silver, and blue silk slippers are crafted with emeralds on the heel and made by mages for the more clumsy members of the royal court. The pleasant jingling of tiny bells can be heard when you dance in these shoes in front of an audience. While wearing these shoes, you add double your proficiency to Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to dance or tumble and opportunity attacks made against you are made with disadvantage.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This small fly is carved of black pearl and no bigger than the real thing. The small fly is hard to spot and requires a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to detect. You can use an action to speak the item's command word to make the fly come alive. While it is activated and within 300 feet of you, you can use your action to move the fly 30 feet and you see and hear through the item for up to one hour. During this time you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. If the fly moves more than 300 feet away from you, it is deactivated. You can deactivate the fly by speaking the command word again as an action. Once the fly has been activated it can't be reactivated for another 24 hours.

    <text>This staff has a head carved of onyx and a shaft of gold and functions as a quarterstaff that grants +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The staff has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along its length.

Six Buttons: You can press one of the staff's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.

If you press button 1, the staff becomes a frost brand greatsword as the top half of the staff transforms into an enormous blade.

If you press button 2, the staff's onyx head transforms into an enormous hammer, turning the staff into a magic maul that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

If you press button 3, the staff's onyx head lengthens and transforms into an pointed tip, transforming the staff into a magic pike that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

If you press button 4, the staff floats on top of liquid like a piece of driftwood. The staff can float with up to 4,000 pounds of weight attached to it.

If you press button 5, the onyx head of the staff sheds bright light in a 60-foot-radius sphere and dim light for an additional 60 feet.

If you press button 6, the staff will suck up 50 gallons of any liquid its head is placed in. Pressing this button again causes the staff to release all the liquid at once out of its head.

Detect Magic: While holding the staff you can use your action to cast the detect magic spell from it. This property can't be used again until next dawn.

Detect Secret Doors and Traps: While holding the staff you can use your action to search for secret doors and traps. If a secret door or trap is within 30 feet of you, the staff's onyx head pulses with light and points at the one nearest to you. This property can't be used again until next dawn.

Thunder Strike: When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the staff, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure the target takes an extra 4d6 thunder damage and is knocked 20 feet away from you and lands prone. This property can't be used again until next dawn.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Arcane Focus: An arcane focus is a special item designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.

Proficiency: simple, staff, quarterstaff

    <text>When the fog of war is at its thickest, soldiers know to attack anyone wearing the enemy's colors or emblems. The traitor's tabard is a finely tailored piece of clothing that can be worn over armor. As an action, the creature wearing the tabard can change the color and crest on the tabard to anything they want.

    <name>Tromberd's Ladle</name>
    <detail>rare</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This silver ladle was created by a dwarven cook named Tromberd, who acted as a cook for a successful adventuring party. As an acolyte of Moradin, Tromberd combined his divine, metalworking, and culinary skills to take his profession to new heights. He created a magical ladle that imbued the meals it made with magical healing properties. While the name and exploits of the adventuring company was lost to the ages, Tromberd's magical ladle has survived and continues to serve astounding and magical meals.
	When the ladle is used to cook a pot of soup or stew for at least 2 hours of constant stirring, the meal becomes magical food that can feed up to 8 creatures. The meal must contain at least 20 gp worth of ingredients, including rare herbs and spices. If the meal is eaten as part of a long rest, the number of hit dice recovered by the creatures eating the meal at the end of the long rest increases by 2 (to the creature's normal maximum). The creatures also gain 10 temporary hit points at the end of that long rest. Once used, the ladle's magic can't be used again until a week passes. The creature who cooks the meal can't gain the magical benefits of the food.
