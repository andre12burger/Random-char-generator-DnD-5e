The congregation's strength is in numbers, and clerics who follow this domain almost never serve alone and are almost always found in at least pairs. Priests of the congregation can favor war or competence over battle might, but all are dedicated to leading large groups of worshippers, sharing their faith, and lending a hand to their co-religionists.

        <name>Divine Domain: Darkness Domain (HB)</name>
        <text>The clerics of the Darkness Within are secretive individuals who detach themselves from society and keep to the shadows. They accommodate themselves to darkness and operate unseen, focusing on hiding what they deem significant from the eyes of those who seek them. The imprint of the Dark Star's reign still resonates with the populace of Aglarion, manifesting in the subconscious memory of the society as a whole. Those who follow the Darkness Within keep their faith to themselves even if they are not devoted to the ideology of the dark solar avatar of their dualistic god. They pray at midnight and venerate the new moon as the absolute peak of their god's power.

Domain Spells:
At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

Darkness Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1st | fog cloud, sleep
3rd | darkness, darkvision
5th | fear, nondetection
7th | greater invisibility, phantasmal killer

        <text>Starting at 1st level, as a bonus action, you can weave shadows around you into a magical cloak that hides your form and protects you from attacks. For 1 minute, creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight, as with blindsight or tremorsense, or can see through illusions, as with truesight. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and summon a 30 foot radius globe of darkness that functions as the darkness spell that lasts for 1 minute. The globe appears in a space that you can see within 30 feet of you. Any magical light effect within the globe is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within the globe must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC when the globe of darkness appears. A creature takes necrotic damage equal to 2d6 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is unaffected.

        <text>Clerics of the Ooze Domain believe in a higher level of physical existence that is represented by oozes. They serve their formless god to learn to be free from physical bounds. They believe that in the end, all organic materials will be wholly absorbed by oozes and are ready to sacrifice even themselves towards the fulfillment of this eventuality. In Aglarion, clerics of the ooze domain usually serve the Blind God, a minor entity that has only a few fanatic believers.

Ooze Domain Spells:
