        <text>Giving orders is second nature to a commander. These exemplary fighters lead their squadrons by inspiring their subordinates and bolstering their fighting prowess through the strength of their voices and their presence. As a result, the forces under their command can achieve incredible feats of battle, even when odds are stacked against them.

        <name>Commander's Orders (Commander (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you can inspire others through the power of your commands. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose any number of creatures other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. Those creatures gain one Command die, a d6.
	Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Command die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Command die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Command die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
	Your Command die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The dice becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

        <name>Martial Archetype: Mercenary (HB)</name>
        <text>Those who offer their martial skills for hire face various challenges with each mission. Their most essential skills are surviving any threat, standing their ground in any situation they face, and overcoming their foes. A good mercenary is always prepared for the unexpected and will creatively improvise a solution to meet the requirements of the battle. Most of the large mercenary companies operate out of the Drayl City States where this type of warfare based on swords-for-hire has long-established traditions.

You can't benefit from the same Fighting Style option more than once. Choose one of the following options at the beginning of your turn:

	• Archery: You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

	• Defense: While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

	• Dueling: When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

	• Great Weapon Fighting: When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
