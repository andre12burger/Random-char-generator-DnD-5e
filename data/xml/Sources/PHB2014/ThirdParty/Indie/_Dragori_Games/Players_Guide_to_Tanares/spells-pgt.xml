    <text>When you cast this spell, you can make 1 to 20 arrows magically enchanted for the duration, making a special magical bond with each of them. You make any ranged attack using these arrows with advantage, as well as ignoring half cover and ¾ cover that protects the target of this attack. Also, for the duration of the spell, you always know where your enchanted arrows are, as well as you can use your action to magically see through one of those arrows of your choice, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses. As long as you are seeing through the arrow, you are blind to your own senses. You will not be able to see through one of its arrows if it is more than 1 mile away from you. If one of these arrows breaks, the enchantment no longer affects it.

It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the aberration, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.
	If your concentration is broken, the aberration doesn't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the aberration, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled aberration can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.

    <text>You manipulate reality to create an echoing effect. As a reaction to the end of another creature's turn, you can cast this spell to replicate the effects of that turn. To use this spell, you must have witnessed the events of that turn within your line of sight. The replicated effects include spellcasting, attacks, damage, and the results of saving throws and ability checks. All targets remain the same, and any attacks or effects that become impossible, such as a target moving out of reach, will simply not occur. No additional dice rolls or checks are required, and the results of the replicated actions remain unchanged.
	It is important to note that casting echoing does not incur any additional costs or expenses, such as consuming spell slots or expending resources from abilities or spells. However, if the original action had any side effects on the caster, such as those caused by a wish spell, you will experience these side effects instead of the original creature, as if you had performed those actions yourself.

    <text>When you cast this spell, a glowing rune appears on the ground in a 5-foot square you can see within range. The first time a creature enters the area on a turn, or if it starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be frozen for the duration. A frozen creature takes 10d6 cold damage at the start of each of its turns and is petrified.
	The cold damage ignores resistance. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, it is no longer frozen. If a frozen creature starts its turn outside the area (for example, if an ally moves it away), this saving throw is made with advantage. If a frozen creature suffers the cold damage from this spell on 5 consecutive turns, it remains petrified after the spell ends.

If the creature's soul is free and willing, the creature returns to life with 10 hit point, provided that it has been dead no longer than 24 hours. This spell can't return a creature to life that has died of old age or one that is an undead, nor can it restore any missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.
	Each time the restored creature ends its turn in contact with the rune, it regains 10 hit points.

    <text>When you cast this spell, a glowing rune appears on the ground in a 5-foot square you can see within range. The first time a creature touches the rune after the spell is cast, the rune disappears and a willing creature is transformed for the duration. An unwilling creature may make a Wisdom saving throw; on a success, the spell ends and the creature is not transformed. You choose which transformation occurs when the rune is touched: Reptilian, Avian or Botanic.

Reptilian: The target becomes covered in scales, grows a long tail, and its mouth turns into a crocodilian maw.

	• The maw is a natural weapon. The target can attack with it using your spell attack modifier, dealing piercing damage equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier on a hit.

	• The scaly hide provides improved protection. While the target is not wearing armor its AC is 13 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

	• The tail has a reach of 10 feet. If a creature enters this reach, the target can take a reaction to attempt to trip the creature. Then, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, or it falls prone.

Avian: The target becomes covered in feathers, grows wings, gains bird-like reflexes and hawk-like eyes.

	• The target gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed.
	• The target gains advantage on any perception checks based on sight.
	• When hit by an attack, the target may take a reaction to move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

Botanic: The target becomes covered in bark, and grows leaves and roots.

	• The target's speed becomes 0.
	• The target gains resistance to non-magical bludgeoning damage.
	• The target gains vulnerability to fire damage.

The interior is furnished with 4 sets of bunk beds with comfortable bedding and a padded chair facing the fireplace. A pantry in the cottage and a barrel of ale in the corner contain enough ale and provisions to sustain 8 people for one day. At the end of the duration, the cottage and any remaining contents created by the spell vanish.

    <text>In an elaborate ritual, you wipe clean the psyche of a humanoid creature and imprint a new directive, effectively making it almost irreversible. The targeted creature is required to be seated on an obsidian throne worth at least 5,000 gp atop a marble circle, both inscribed with arcane symbols. The creature must also be adorned with a tameranium bracelet on its right wrist and a bauronite bracelet on its left wrist.
	The spell carries significant side effects; however, these are mitigated by increasing amounts of tameranium and bauronite used. With a minimum of 50 gp worth of each material, you gain 2 levels of exhaustion and are unable to cast this spell for 48 hours. Utilizing at least 500 gp of each reduces the exhaustion to one level, but the spell remains unusable for 24 hours. If you use at least 1000 gp of each, you suffer no exhaustion but are unable to recast the spell for 12 hours. The spell fails if casted before the time above pass.
	The subject of the spell must remain seated for the entire casting time. Upon completion, you may choose to implement one of the directives Mindless Soldier, Berserker Beast, or Focused Servant on the target. The Mind Return option can be used on a target already affected by this spell to reverse its effects, which is the only way to do it besides the casting of a wish spell.

Mindless Soldier: The creature becomes dedicated to executing orders and will only comply with commands given by individuals bound to it during the casting. You can designate any number of entities that are part of the same organization known to the creature before the ritual.

Berserker Beast: The target operates on pure instinct and obeys only the caster's basic commands. The target loses speech capability and becomes exceptionally hostile. Also, it has advantage on Strength ability checks and saving throws, and it gains a +2 bonus on Strength-based damage rolls, while it has disadvantage on Intelligence ability checks and saving throws.

Focused Servant: The target concentrates all its proficiency on one particular field of knowledge. Choose one skill or tool. The creature gains proficiency in it, doubles its proficiency bonus for checks related to it, and gains advantage on these checks. However, it cannot apply its proficiency bonus to any other skill checks that aren't directly related to the chosen skill or tool.

Mind Return: For this effect, it is also necessary to provide an object that once belonged to the target, which the spell consumes. If done, you revert the target to its state before the spell was cast on it.

    <text>You shoot a powerful beam of dark purple energy from your open hands at a creature within range. You make a ranged spell attack against the target, and if it hits, it takes 7d6 psychic damage and becomes frightened for 1d4 rounds.
	If you are in dim light or darkness, increase the damage by 3d6 and the target remains frightened for 2d4 rounds. The target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the frightened condition.

Frightened:
	• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
	• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the sword stabs the creature, dealing 5d10 necrotic damage. The sword remains stuck to the target, and on subsequent turns, you can use your action to deal 4d10 necrotic damage to the target automatically. The sword dissipates and the spell ends if you use your action to do anything else.
	The creature cannot have its hit points restored by any means until the sword is removed or the spell ends.

On a failure, the sword is not removed, and the target takes half as much damage.

3-4 | The branches and vines begin to whip the creature, dealing 2d6 slashing damage per turn as long as it remains in the area.
5-6 | Branches, roots, and leaves sway around the creature, blocking its movement and vision. Terrain occupied by the wall of bushes is considered difficult terrain. While within the area, the creature has disadvantage on attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
