    <text>A character may only attune to the Continental Crown by performing a special 1-hour ceremony with six other characters who are each attuned to the corresponding Seals of the respective nation.
	While attuned to the crown and wearing it, you are immune to any effect that would sense your emotions or read your thoughts, divination spells, and the charmed condition. The crown even foils wish spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect your mind or to gain information about you.
	The crown has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast the wish spell from it. The crown regains one expended charge every ten years.

This is a golden two finger ring worn on the second and third finger. The ring is set with a large diamond in the center and three smaller sapphires on either side.
	The ring has three charges. You can use your action and expend one charge from the ring to try to make a humanoid creature forget the details of a conversation you've had with it in the past hour, replacing its memories with an alternative explanation you provide (limited to a short sentence or two). The explanation must sound plausible, and immediately fails if you imply the target made any sort of agreement, choices, or decisions. The creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it loses its memories of the conversation with you and accepts your explanation regarding what occurred. On a successful saving throw, the target isn't aware you tried to affect its memories.
	All expended charges are replenished each day at dawn.
