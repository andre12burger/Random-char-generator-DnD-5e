    <description>Not all mageborn are cut out for the rules, regulations, and intense study and practice required by the Amethyst Academy, and some do not make it through their schooling. An outcast may still be under the guidance of the Academy, performing field work or odd jobs that require a more hands on approach. Oftentimes these outcasts dabble in dangerous magics, and have far less caution, and far too much confidence for the Academy's liking.

Octarine Breath:
d8 | Breath
1 | The target takes 6d12 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
2 | The target takes 6d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
3 | The target takes 6d12 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
4 | The target takes 6d12 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
5 | The target takes 6d12 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
6 | At the start of each of its turns, the affected target uses all its movement to move directly towards the closest creature it can see. Then, the affected target uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the affected target does nothing this turn. At the end of each of its turns, the affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.
7 | At the start of each of its turns, the affected target gains 1 level of contamination. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.
8 | The target is struck by an additional ray. Roll on this table twice more. There's no limit to how many additional rays can strike a single creature in this manner.</text>

    <description>This extremely withdrawn Academy Director dwells on the moon. Although they typically interact with mortals in the guise of a human wizard, Amaranthyst is in fact an ancient delerium dragon. Indeed, the dragon's unique complexion of crystalline purple scales and gemstone-like features is the namesake of the Amethyst Academy itself.

Personality Trait. How do you know if you are the dreamer, or merely the dream? I speak in absurd paradox, asking mortals vexing questions to which they cannot answer within their limited reference frame.

Ideal. A single grain of sand makes no sound upon falling, but a million grains make a sound. Hence a thousand nothings become something. That is the nature of magic.

Bond. Mortals believe they can comprehend the fundamental forces of the universe, but they are gravely mistaken. If I know one thing, it is that even I know nothing.

Flaw. I find the fixed nature of the mortal world deeply strange. It is for the best that this world is unravelled by delerium, for chaos will only improve it.

Amaranthyst is order out of chaos incarnate. Aeons ago, the dragon entered the mortal plane from the Space Between Worlds, and has aided mortal mages out of curiosity and amusement. They have long sought to understand the unknowable properties of the strange dimension where it sprung into existence, and has spent millennia wandering that unfathomable place. Amaranthyst has long known about the secret properties of delerium, and views the crystals as merely the fundamental building block of reality itself. To them, the crystals are transforming the world into something wondrous, and he does not understand why mortals would fear it.

      <name>Lair Actions</name>
      <text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

	• Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.

	• A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage. 

	• Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</text>

      <name>Regional Effects</name>
      <text>The region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

	• The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.

	• Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.

	• Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.

If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over 1d10 days.</text>

      <name>Black Dragon Lairs</name>
      <text>Black dragons prefer to lair in swamps and jungles—the more dismal and fetid, the better. Within those environs, they favor ruins for their defensibility and dreary aesthetic.
	When choosing their lairs, black dragons are fond of locations that are naturally constraining and con founding. Whether adventurers seeking the dragon must wind their way through the roots of an ancient mangrove swamp or brave a trap-filled boggy ruin, the experience promises to be a deadly affair.

      <name>Additional Lair Actions</name>
      <text>At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) black dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

	• Filth Burst: The dragon chooses a point on the ground it can see within 120 feet of it. A 20-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder of watery filth centered on that point erupts from the ground until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature in the cylinder when it appears or that ends its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cylinder is difficult terrain.

	• Grasping Muck: Tendrils of roiling muck extend from the dragon's lair to grasp up to three creatures of the dragon's choice that it can see within the lair. A targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained until initiative count 20 on the next round.

	• Noxious Gas: A bubble of swamp gas erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within its lair. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	• Ennui: Creatures that spend a year within 10 miles of the dragon's lair are filled with listless despair.

	• Grating Spies: Trilling, obnoxious birds, bugs, and reptiles follow any Humanoid creatures unknown to the dragon within 6 miles of the lair, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. The dragon can suppress this effect at will.

	• Rotting Domain: Stinging bugs are aggressive and the air is heavy with the odor of rot within 6 miles of the lair.

      <name>Black Dragon Treasures</name>
      <text>Black dragons appreciate objects of cultural, magical, or scientific significance that originated from lost cultures. Knowing a relic they possess is coveted by others because it presents a link to a lost past is what gives that relic its value. Black dragons also love conventional treasures such as gems (particularly opals), precious metals that don't corrode easily, and stone sculptures.
	Because their lairs are inevitably slimy and dank, if not outright flooded, black dragons rarely have cloth, wood, or paper items unless such items are stored in watertight containers. Black dragons versed in magic often record notes and rituals on bones, shells, and metal plates instead of paper or parchment. These unusual works are art in their own right, each featuring rows of graceful Draconic script etched with the dragon's own acid.
	Most black dragons keep their treasure well hidden and have a private viewing room for particularly prized possessions. Knowing that interloping inferiors were able to so much as see their hoard can drive a black dragon to a state of rage.

Black Dragon Art Objects:
d10 | Object
1 | An elegant necklace owned by a beloved noble who disappeared years ago
2 | Stone carvings representing a pantheon of deities that passed from common knowledge long ago
3 | The lost secret to forging an alloy imbued with arcane potential, etched on twelve metal disks the size of dinner plates
4 | A sealed platinum flask containing the last known aqua vitae created by a master dwarf distiller
5 | A ceremonial longsword with an embossed silver hilt and a blade of amber
6 | A lavishly illustrated genealogy kept in a magically sealed container that disputes a current monarch's right to the throne
7 | Heretical religious symbols carved on a trio of gemstones the size of apples
8 | An elaborately carved mask representing a god of harvest and fertility
9 | Metal horn caps inset with gems, made for the dragon by loyal cultists
10 | A beautifully enameled urn holding the desiccated heart of the dragon's former green dragon rival

    <description>The ancient black dragon of the Shadowfens is among the oldest living dragons in the known world. Residing in the ruins of Tolan's Keep, this dragon has a history of torment against the people of the Eastern Vales. While occasionally adventurers and even armies mustered in the Vales take up arms against the dragon, these attempts to drive the beast from the Shadowfens have never succeeded. Most now avoid venturing into the northern reaches of the marsh. Sometimes, when the wetlands are letting off ample mist, you can see the shadow of black wings soaring through the swamp gasses.
	Amarodial has a lasting rivalry with Commander Callisto of the Caspian Scalebreaker Legion, who lives just over the southern mountain range. The two have fought several great battles. Amarodial loves conflict, and thrives on devouring those foolish enough to believe they can defeat them. Some say that the ruined castle that they use as a lair is filled with thousands of bones from those the great dragon has feasted upon.

Ancient Black Dragon:
The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.
	With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.
	When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.

Brutal and Cruel: All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.
	A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.

Foes and Servants: Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.
	Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master's domain.
	A black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.
	Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon's hunger.

Wealth of the Ancients: Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.

Dragons:
True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
	Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
	Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
	True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

Dragon Age Categories:
Category | Size | Age Range
Wyrmling | Medium | 5 years or less
Young | Large | 6-100 years
Adult | Huge | 101-800 years
Ancient | Gargantuan | 801 years or more

Chromatic Dragons:
The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.

Driven by Greed: Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

Creatures of Ego: Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

Dangerous Lairs: A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
	Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

Queen of Evil Dragons: Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
	Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
	Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.

    <description>This powerful Academy Director wizard is descended from a line of sorcerer-kings who infused their bloodline with a celestial heritage. As a result, he has angelic features, pale lavender skin, a short black beard, and sparkling opalescent eyes. He is often encountered simply wearing goggles and a stained leather smith's apron over a purple tunic, setting aside his Academy robes for attire more appropriate for his work.
	Alabaster is a peerless master of alchemy and transmutation magic. His experimentations and research involve using delerium to alter the material properties of other matter. Alabaster is well known to have created the formula for aqua delerium. He has already successfully developed a process to use delerium to transform lead into gold, but is now much more interested in using the stones to create some form of life. However, Alabaster is keenly aware of the erratic and chaotic effects of the crystals on flesh, which tend to produce insane, contaminated monsters. Instead, deep within the depths of the Enigma Ziggurat, he has fashioned several prototype human-sized golems with delerium crystal hearts. His unique method has produced magically animated constructs imbued with sentience and personality. Each is a unique and immaculately crafted being with intricate facial features, often decorated with porcelain, glass, and silver. The archmage quietly released a handful of his creations into the world to see what adventures they will find.

Personality Trait. I seek to finish any conversation as quickly as possible so I can go back to my experiments.

Ideal. If it is true that celestial beings created life and the universe, I am merely striving to emulate the example of my ancestors. The world is but a grand experiment, now longforgotten by those who set it in motion.

Bond. Delerium is the true philosopher's stone: its transformative properties are supreme. Using its magic, we can transform anything — perhaps even life itself.

Flaw. I have created many things in my life. However, I quickly move on to the next project and care little for my past experiments.

Alabaster is a close confidant, partner, and sometimes lover to Penumbra, the Archmage of Terene. Together, the two are parents to several up-and-coming Academy students.

    <description>Director of the Amethyst Academy, Lasaia is a pencil-thin elven woman of indeterminate age. The Academy Director always levitates or flies through the air; her long elegant purple robes sweeping across the floors, and her platinum hair is constantly moving as if she were underwater.
	Writings attributed to Lasaia Nightbreeze have been found in Academy textbooks hundreds of years old, most notably a thousand-year-old tome titled On the Origins of Evocation buried in the great Starspire Observatory. She is sometimes seen drifting through the halls of Paradox Castle like a wayward ghost. She greets students occasionally, but many are uneasy around her and find her blank stares and emotionless expression rather haunting.

Personality Trait. I speak in an ethereal voice, and often my words slip into ancient dialects and riddled expressions.

Ideal. I know full well the destructive potential of evocation magic. These world-shattering spells must be kept as safeguarded secrets, to be used only in times of dire need.

Bond. The other Academy Directors cannot match my absolute mastery of war magic. Their magic is but parlor tricks compared to the destructive power I command.

Flaw. I often miss or completely ignore social cues, forgetting that other beings have opinions... or relevant thoughts.

There is a rumor amongst many Academy students and even some faculty regarding Lasaia's origins. Students and faculty speculate that she came through the Elfgates when elves first arrived, and unlike the other elves of the world, the archmage knows exactly why and how they came. When Headmaster Rupert Greywell of Paradox Castle once confronted her on the topic in front of several observing students, Lasaia trapped him within a forcecage and classes were canceled. It is well-known that Lasaia has been trying to replace Rupert Greywell for some time and is seeking a good excuse to demote the care-free oaf.

In the twisting unrealities of Paradox Castle, there sometimes appears a blue door with a gemstone knob in various locations throughout the school. The door leads to Lasaia's offices and lab, but students who have opened the door have found nothing but an eternal black void stretching out forever.

Deep within this secret laboratory, Lasaia Nightbreeze has been working to unlock the full destructive power of delerium. She has assembled a sequestered team of brilliant evokers all sworn to absolute secrecy — the archmage has inscribed an explosive rune on the forehead of each wizard, which will slay them if they utter a single word of their great project outside her lab. Together, they have created the disjunction bomb, a horrifically devastating delerium-based weapon of mass destruction with the power to annihilate an entire city district. Now, they are working on even more powerful variants.

One of the compelling outcomes of this research has been the potential for delerium to be used simply as a conventional power source which could unlock wondrous improvements into the lives of common folk, though such quotidian applications bore the archmage. She is convinced delerium is the next evolution of magic, not a frivolous tool.

    <description>Academy Penumbra, one of the Academy Directors, is a short tiefling woman with mottled brown-red skin. She has large, spiraling gray horns emerging from her forehead, and keeps her bluegreen hair in buns along the sides of her head. The archmage has deep, dark eyes, and sharp pointed teeth.
	Amongst the few who have met her in person, Penumbra is known as being both incredibly charming and extremely disarming. Those who speak with her are caught completely off guard by her outward kindness, and find themselves talking endlessly to her. Only after Penumbra leaves do they realize she never said anything about herself, and simply listened to them talk Penumbra enjoys the trappings of everyday life, and is fascinated by the people in it. She enjoys spending time amongst the locals and admiring the sandy beaches and warm weather in Terene, though her powerful enchantments cause those who meet her to forget she was ever there. Penumbra's tendency to mingle with common folk has been a concern of the other Directors for some time. They know she travels to cities all over the continent, and often appears in taverns and pubs to hear tales of local problems, or sometimes sends hapless adventurers on dangerous quests to unknown ends.

Personality Traits. I aim to be friendly and humble to the people around me. I am often delighted by mundane non-magical life.

Ideal. The more we can learn about the people of this world, the more we can use our magic to change it.

Bond. Alabaster has been with me through thick and thin for years and I admire his dedication and passion.

Flaw. I often upset my peers with my carefree attitude and nonchalant use of magic.

The archmage works from a secret academy stronghold, where she had studied the effects of delerium contamination on the mind to understand the madness it causes. She has been using fish, rats, and birds as test subjects, attempting to imbue them with intelligence enough to manifest psionic abilities. If successful, she hopes to begin testing her method with human volunteers soon, potentially using delerium to imbue non-mageborn with magical powers.
	Penumbra has an on-again, off-again relationship with Archmage Alabaster of Liberio. The two have several magically gifted children.

    <description>Leuchten
Capital of the Gap
Population: Approximately 10,000 people
Ruler: Baron Boris the Bold, a human knight
Civil War Allegiance: Cecilia von Kessel
Known For: Impressive Fortifications, Siege Workshops

A great fortress-city rises up in the flat valley flanked by the Drakeclare Mountains to the west and the Glimmer Mountains to the east. Leuchten stands as a bastion against the armies of the south. Imposing walls of stone and round towers bristling with guns and cannons are layered atop jagged wedge-shaped earthworks. A deep black moat surrounds the city, the only entrance via two longspanning drawbridges at the north and south ends.

Leuchten defends the important land route connecting Westemär to the southern nations. Inside the city proper are all manner of arsenals, stockpiles, workshops, and barracks.
	Naturally, the city has faced more sieges over its history than perhaps any other city on the continent, and certainly within Westemär. Despite its impressive defenses, it has fallen twice — though never to a direct assault. When Albrecht von Drakken died in battle amidst his failed invasion of Caspia, the Scalebreakers broke against the walls and guns of Leuchten in their retaliatory attack. During the Mage Wars, the city was briefly captured thanks to a forged document, and fell again thanks to adventurous mercenaries during a minor conflict between Westemär and Liberio.
	Given the strategic importance of Leuchten, the city does not have an ancestral noble house as its traditional ruler. Rather, the monarchs of Westemär have typically assigned title and authority to one of their top military figures, or, as is more often the case, a problematic royal sibling who needs a distant but seemingly important assignment far away from the politics of the capital. It was previously under the rule of Cecilia von Kessel, but since her death the city is now controlled by her former general, Baron Boris the Bold.

Knight:
Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and noble causes. A knight's alignment determines the extent to which a pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and hirelings who are commoners.

Fish guts are placed daily upon the shoulders of the statue to attract gulls to perch and feast. Bogdan Strangewayes, an old hermit and druid of the Old Faith lives in a small shack nearby. He tends to the shrine daily and performs ancient rituals to appease Nodens and prevent the Old God from sweeping Drannsmund in to the ocean.

Druid:
Druids dwell in forests and other secluded wilderness locations, where they protect the natural world from monsters and the encroachment of civilization. Some are tribal shamans who heal the sick, pray to animal spirits, and provide spiritual guidance.

Bond. The jungle is my home. I will protect it at all costs, and take vengeance against those who trespass here.

Flaw. I am incredibly impatient, whether in conversation or battle.

Tenesha wants to maintain the peace in Terene, but has an intense hatred for Caspians. She has long considered striking back into their lands as revenge for all the bloodshed their invasions have caused in Terene.

Riding throughout the jungles of Terene atop great Clawstrider Raptors or other giant lizards, the Rangers are skilled at guerrilla tactics and mounted combat, often wearing camouflaged leather armor reinforced with jungle leaves and hardwoods. The Clawstriders are a fearsome and stealthy force. If you see a lone ranger in the jungles, you are already surrounded.

    <description>Claudia is a delicate noble woman in her mid-fifties. She has sunken features and a small, narrow face framed by flowing silver hair. She often wears a wide-brimmed brightly-colored hat and matching dress. She adorns herself with pearls, rings, jewels, and other finery. She speaks with a soothing, honeyed voice and often carries an air of elegance and false kindness.

	• Personality Trait. I present myself as a woman of importance, and speak from a position of power. One must know how to sound like a queen if one is to be treated as such.

	• Ideal. The House of Eden deserves to be the most powerful house in Elyria and so I represent it at all times as if it always has been, and always will be.

	• Bond. I must see the House of Eden rise to power again, and reclaim itself as the leading family of Elyria.

	• Flaw. I am quick to denounce the sins of others, but will never examine my own actions.

Claudia is desperately working on rebuilding her house's connections in Elyria. She would eventually like to see one of her daughters become Divine Matriarch, but none have mustered up the dedication and faith to become clerics of the Sacred Flame. In moments of fragile faith, she contemplates other magical means to get back the power she craves. In the meantime, she is working diligently to manipulate her way back on to the Cabinet. She talks sweetly to everyone she meets, but is just as likely to scheme against them if it means putting her family's name in a position of greater power in Elyria.

House Eden:
House Eden was once regarded as the most powerful family in Elyria. Over the past century, three separate Divine Matriarchs have been members of House Eden, at least a dozen High Flamekeepers, and two Lords Regents. If any has come close to establishing a new monarchical line in Elyria, it has been House Eden. However, their fortunes fell considerably after the assassination of Divine Matriarch Courage IX, who had been a scion of their household.
	Outwardly, the house holds deeply fundamentalist views regarding the Faith, and is zealous to the extreme. They believe their righteousness begets prosperity, and have used their position to funnel vast amounts of coin collected by the Faith into their family vaults. Their methods have never crossed the line of theft, however: instead, previous High Flamekeepers and Divine Matriarchs have openly gifted indulgences and land to the family as "blessings upon their faithful service" and other such contrivances. They use these funds to build lavish, castle-like cathedrals on their estates, filled with expensive art, sculpture, and gold decorations.

Noble:
Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.
	The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.

    <description>Commander Livingston, a human veteran is the current ruler of Port Brynor. She commands the strongest military force in the Vales and overlooks much of the trade passing through her city. She is a stern and intellectual woman, but honest to a fault. Commander Livingston has no desire to stretch her reach any further than the outskirts of her city, and instead wants to ensure that the Eastern Vales remains a free and proud collective of communities. She has been known to aid many of the other towns and cities along the Dawnbreaker Trail when dealing with unwanted monsters from the woods, or rival nations interfering.
	Esther is a sturdy woman with short brown hair, thin pointed eyebrows, dark eyes, and pursed lips. She is often clad in dull steel armor and carries her sword with her wherever she goes. She drapes a red mantle cape off her left pauldron.

Personality Trait. I speak in a gruff and commanding voice. I haven't gotten where I am being soft, so don't expect me to humor you with false kindness.

Ideal. It's a dangerous world, full of dangerous people. Rely on yourself, and those you know you can trust. Be wary of everyone else.

Bond. Port Brynor is a strong position in the Vales, and one I plan to maintain and hold for as long as possible.

Flaw. I value integrity over everything, and will never lie or hold back information, even when it would be better for me to keep my mouth shut.

Esther knows very well that frail alliances hold the Eastern Vales together. Many have tried to claim these lands in the past, and many have been torn down by foolhardy battles, or overstepping their bounds. Esther wants to be known as a peacekeeper for the Vales, keeping her own borders in check, and protecting the various petty kingdoms from extending their reach any further than they need to.

Veteran:
Veterans are professional fighters that take up arms for pay or to protect something they believe in or value. Their ranks include soldiers retired from long service and warriors who never served anyone but themselves.

      <text>If the vampire isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.
	While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
	While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.</text>

Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point.

    <description>Today, the ruler of House Kleinkessel is Countess Constance Kleinkessel. She is secretly a vampire. Constance Kleinkessel is a voluptuous woman who appears in her late forties. She has gleaming emerald eyes, crimson red lips, a flushed round face, and a small pointed nose. Her jet-black hair is tied up into braids and woven into an intricate headpiece set with pearls. She wears a scarlet gown and is dripping with jewelry. Her painted fingernails are sharpened into points. She often meets guests for dinner, where she licks her lips and runs her fingers on the edge of a cup of red wine.

	• Personality Trait. I could eat you up. I fill my speech with macabre innuendo which mix dining, physical intimacy, and slaughter.

	• Ideal. The living must be made to serve the dead. When my plans come to fruition, mortals will be divided into cattle and corpses.

	• Bond. I am bound by bonds of blood to serve dark masters and vampiric overlords, but one day I will take it all for myself.

	• Flaw. I can't ever resist a good meal... would you like to stay for dinner?
Constance Kleinkessel herself is in fact the sister of Helena I.

Originally known as Camilla von Kessel, she has passed through a series of identities to hide her vampiric nature. Every few decades, she marries a hapless nobleman, slowly draining his life force so that he appears to expire from old age. Shortly thereafter, her so-called daughter inherits the estate and the cycle continues.
	During the Civil War, Constance Kleinkessel used her vampiric abilities to manipulate and scheme alongside Cecilia von Kessel and Lord Commander Elias Drexel to plot the murder of Mannfred von Kessel. She had planned to follow through and murder her co-conspirators, but the subsequent death of Cecilia von Kessel was an unexpected development: she had been planning to target Cecelia's future children with her replacement scheme to seize the throne of Westemär.
	Since undead creatures are not immune to the effects of delerium contamination, Constance Kleinkessel has also worked closely with her doctor, the malfeasant wizard Deidrick Mors, to experiment with new ways delerium can create augmented vampires.


Vampire:
Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces.

Dark Desires. Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.

Born from Death. Most of a vampire's victims become vampire spawn-ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master's control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.

Chained to the Grave. Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn't receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way.

Undead Nature. Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air.

    <description>Isabella is a bold, middle-aged noble woman with long brown hair usually tied up in a ponytail. She wears a modest long skirt and blouse and has served three terms as Consul of the Republic of Liberio. Isabella is a well-spoken woman and a powerful leader. She is a staunch supporter of the people and has fought hard for the city and its freedoms.

Personality Trait. I always speak as though I am giving a speech. I choose my words carefully to ensure their impact.

Ideal. No gods or kings rule Liberio; it is the people who make things great. By the choices of the people will we see our triumph or our ruin.

Bond. Liberio is constantly on the brink of losing its freedom to one of the nations hounding our borders. Our freedom is a fragile thing, and we must treasure it.

Flaw. I will go to any length for freedom: lie, cheat, steal, and if I have to kill, I will.

During her years in office, Isabella has found herself having to stand up to the High King of Caspia, and the Divine Matriarch of Elyria. She has struggled to have a voice in the concerns of delerium and Westemär, and has continually been pushed out of the major debates regarding the continent. Isabella feels it is her duty to bring the concerns of Liberio to the table and make a bold example to show Liberio is a player in the continental ongoings, especially during such tumultuous times.

Noble:
Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.
	The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.

    <description>No one living in the world today has shaped the political destiny of the continent through their words and actions more than Divine Matriarch Mercy V. The responsibility and gravity of these decisions weighs heavily upon her. Now twenty years into her tenure, she was the youngest ever to assume the office. Nevertheless, she wields incredible divine power.
	Before taking up the position as the head of the Sacred Flame, Mercy V was named Emeralda Poe. As youngest scion of House Poe, she was groomed from a young age to take up the mantle of a Flamekeeper by her father, Lord Balthazar Poe. Remarkably gifted with the Divine Light, she could channel the holy magic of the Sacred Flame from the age of ten. Nevertheless, her election to the office over the experienced miracle-worker Lucretia Mathias was a shocking upset.
	Mercy V speaks with warm wisdom and fiery conviction, and holds each syllable of every hymn, prayer, or text of the Sacred Flame in her memory. A tall and slender woman in her late forties, Mercy V has long, wavy black hair and a striking gaze. Her garb consists of ornate flowing white robes with golden trim and embroidered with golden filigree. The symbol of the Sacred Flame is emblazoned prominently upon the robes. She carries a long scepter of white-gold, and wears a large frilled collar that looks like golden flames flickering around her head.

Personality Trait. Though I know every word of our holy texts, I do not use them in my speech except when I am conducting prayers or rituals. To speak them otherwise is to use these words in vain. If others cite the Song of Fire against me, I remind them devils can quote scripture too.

Ideal. The Sacred Flame is the guiding light of the world, which will lead us to truth and righteousness. It is my role to help others follow its holy beacon, a narrow path we must all walk together. The more good we put into the world, the brighter the road ahead becomes.

Bond. My office comes with great responsibility, and the power I hold is a burden, not a privilege. I understand now that sometimes one must step through shadows in their quest towards the light, but I shall bring justice to those consumed by darkness.

Flaw. The ancient words of the saints and martyrs are absolute and incontrovertible. I have disdain for those who try to reinterpret ancient truths which have stood the test of time with new ideas.

The cosmic disaster, civil war, and religious schism raging in Westemär have been pressing challenges for the Divine Matriarch. It was Mercy V who declared delerium an unholy blight and dispatched the Silver Order to Drakkenheim, and she who decided to expel Lucretia Mathias for blasphemy. She knows full well that her proclamations are slowly leading the continent down the path of outright war. Others in the Faith might be eager to make war against the Amethyst Academy, or transform Elyria into a holy empire by conquering Westemär, but Mercy V takes no joy from either prospect. For her, these decisions were made from necessity. The righteous path runs narrow, and she stands resolute to do what must be done to protect the faithful and the world.
	Mercy V was more surprised than anyone when she won the position of Divine Matriarch over Lucretia Mathias, as she had been a longtime admirer of the prophetic cleric. When the meteor fell upon Drakkenheim, Mercy V earnestly believed in Lucretia Mathias's vision. It was not until the stories of the unspeakable horrors from that place first emerged, and Lucretia Mathias returned with an eldritch stone embedded within her, that the Divine Matriarch grasped the darkness which had taken root in the world.
	Mercy V is horrified by how far Lucretia has taken the Falling Fire, and is convinced it must be the work of demonic possession or some kind of otherworldly malevolence controlling her. The Divine Matriarch would like to see Lucretia Mathias captured so she can have her repent and renounce the Falling Fire. Theologically, however, she does find the prophecies and arguments of Lucretia Mathias compelling. She often questions how, if their positions had been swapped, things may have gone differently. However, she knows in her heart that no good can come from the delerium.
	As for the Amethyst Academy, the Divine Matriarch has no trust for the Directorate. She believes they are merely waiting for their best opportunity to convince the nobility to dissolve the Edicts of Lumen. She fears that too many power-hungry nobles will be easily swayed by the prospect of deleriumforged weapons, and that the terrible arcane might of such blasphemous magic will overpower those who stand against it.
	Ultimately, the Divine Matriarch weeps for the fate of Westemär. If none can rise to the task of ruling it with truth and righteousness, she sees saving that nation as another burden she must bear for the good of all.

    <description>The current head of the household is Duke Ludwig von Fritz, a cantankerous and covetous noble miser. The decrepit man is suffering from long-term delerium contamination, made worse by his reliance on an utter quack of a doctor who uses the duke to test his own tinctures.

	• Personality Trait. I don't care for pleasantries and care even less for appearances, even my own. I speak openly about my thoughts, and can't resist the opportunity to belittle others' deeds.

	• Ideal. I am tremendously pleased that the Civil War ultimately destroyed House von Kessel. Now, I can carve out the Marshlands as a petty kingdom of my own.

	• Bond. I seethe over the destruction wrought upon Todesfeld as a result of the Civil War — not because of what has happened to the people of the city, mind you, but what it has done to my fortune ever since.

	• Flaw. There is nothing anyone can do to earn my respect or admiration other than money and power.

Duke von Fritz's wife died several years ago of delerium contamination after the Todesfeld Dam broke. His eight children run their own estates, preferring to have as little contact as possible with their father. He eagerly took arms against Mannfred von Kessel during the Civil War. He eyes the port of Drannsmund and the city of Leuchten, and has begun eagerly purchasing weapons and armor from the Amethyst Academy hoping to increase his military prowess.

Noble:
Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.
	The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.

    <description>A finely-dressed male human liege, Duke von Baden is a stately man in his mid-forties. After spending his youth adventuring among pirates in the Middle Sea, Valentin took up the mantle of the Duke of Drannsmund when his father and elder brother were slain in the early attempts to reclaim Drakkenheim. Now a shrewd admiral and diplomat, Duke von Baden chose discretion during the Civil War, remaining neutral throughout the conflict despite repeated entreaties from both sides of House von Kessel.

	• Personality Trait. I conduct myself with professional savvy and charm, addressing others with their formal titles and proper names. I pepper my speech with nautical references and naval terminology.

	• Ideal. A good business sense, fair exchange, and mutual profit set the sails for a good relationship, whether in life, love, or politics.

	• Bond. I must be a safe harbor to my city, its ships, and its people. Under my leadership, I will shelter them from the storm facing our times.

	• Flaw. Just as one must sail carefully on uncharted waters, one should regard new allies and situations carefully. It is better to remain distant and impartial, keeping along shallow waters, lest you become caught up in an unseen tempest far from shore.

Duke von Baden now wrestles heavily on whether or not he should forbid the trade and export of delerium within his city. However, that could compromise his ambitions. Since he remained staunchly neutral during the Civil War, he has cold relationships with the other dukes and nobles. Valentin increasingly believes Drannsmund is best positioned as an independent city-state: a northern rival to the independent Liberio.

Liege:
Many nobles of the great nations of the continent lead their own soldiers into battle, or set out on heroic adventures and diplomatic missions. Especially in the lands of Caspia, princes and princesses are more often than not trained and skilled combatants, looking to make their mark as a scion of their house.

    <description>Elder Nightsong has watched over the Circle of Danu and its druids for thousands of years. They are a respected druid sage amongst not only other druids, but all the people of Terene. The elder is a strange turtlefolk with pale, green, wrinkled skin and squinting beady eyes. They have a beard of moss that hangs off their chin, and their shell is adorned with carvings of ancient symbols of Danu. Elder Nightsong carries a gnarled wooden walking stick that has many mushrooms and flowers growing from it.

Personality Trait. I speak on behalf of the forest and the earth, for mortals today can no longer hear the true voice of Danu. I am slow and ancient in my ways, but I offer wisdom to all who seek it.

Ideal. Danu is life. Without her blessing we cannot survive, and if we continue on our path, she will abandon us.

Bond. I am the keeper of these sacred grounds, and my followers are those who wish to aid in the betterment of this world. Together we can heal the harm being caused throughout the continent.

Flaw. For all my sagely advice, I find myself untrusting of outsiders, and assume the worst in foreign travelers.

Elder Nightsong enjoys sharing their wisdom with those passionate about the Old Gods, and keeping the temples of their ancient people safe and protected.

Druid:
Druids dwell in forests and other secluded wilderness locations, where they protect the natural world from monsters and the encroachment of civilization. Some are tribal shamans who heal the sick, pray to animal spirits, and provide spiritual guidance.

    <description>Archmages are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption.
	An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.

    <description>These strange arachnid-like creatures seem to weave together partial realities, parallel dimensions, and alternate timelines like a spider spinning its web. They have features that resemble that of a large spider, but their twisted forms, elongated torso, fanged maws, and spiny hides give them an otherworldly guise that makes them hard to distinguish as anything from this plane of existence. Those who have faced one have commented on the broken sense of reality that occurs when attempting to attack an eldritch crawler.

    <description>This floating mass of wet flabby flesh drifts through the air, its many long spindly tendrils dangling down like some form of incomprehensible jellyfish. Oftentimes these creatures appear in strange hues of pale pinks, purples, and whites. Their large eye placed in the middle of their fleshy mass glows with octarine hues and their gaze weakens the body and mind. The soft sound of thrumming and suckling follows them as insane chattering of unknown languages murmur in the minds of those unfortunate enough to behold these creatures that drift through the thin places into our world.

Floating inches above the ground, its hands out to either side as shifting motes of otherworldly energy float amongst its long, gnarled fingers.

Chittering whispers and slurping chorused mumbles of maddening truths and unfathomable realities echo in the minds of those who bear witness to this mastermind of the space between worlds.

      <name>A White Dragon's Lair</name>
      <text>White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.
	A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.
	A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in its lair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.</text>
    </legendary>
    <legendary category="lair">
      <name>Lair Actions</name>
      <text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

	• Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.

	• Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage. 	• The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</text>

      <name>Regional Effects</name>
      <text>The region containing a legendary white dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

	• Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.

	• Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when the dragon is at rest.

	• Icy walls block off areas in the dragon's lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. 	• If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.

If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.</text>

      <name>White Dragon Lairs</name>
      <text>A white dragon's lair is a place of freezing temperatures and profound solitude. Forgotten mountain holds, inaccessible chasms, and frozen caverns buried deep beneath glacial ice are typical of the places white dragons seek out to make their homes.
	White dragons enjoy the mournful sound of the wind and frequently choose lairs with long, winding tunnels down which icy gusts can travel. They seldom work to improve their lairs, but when they do, it is often to channel wind currents to create effects the dragon finds pleasing. The labyrinthine tunnels and the mirror-like icy surfaces in a white dragon's lair confound would-be thieves and might foil their escape.

      <name>Additional Lair Actions</name>
      <text>At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) white dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

	• Blinding Sleet: Driving sleet falls in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until initiative count 20 on the next round.

	• Whirling Wind: A strong wind blows in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on strong wind). The dragon's flying is not affected by this wind, which lasts until the next time the dragon uses a lair action or until the dragon dies.

    <legendary category="lair">
      <name>Additional Regional Effects</name>
      <text>Any of these effects might appear in the area around a white dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the Monster Manual:

	• Biting Chill: Extreme cold envelops the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on extreme cold). If the climate in the area already features extreme cold, the cold is numbing, giving creatures in the area without immunity or resistance to cold damage disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks.

	• Mirror Ice: The icy surfaces in the dragon's lair reflect light like mirrors, giving creatures in the lair other than the dragon disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage, any creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.

      <name>White Dragon Treasures</name>
      <text>White dragons favor gems and precious metals that mirror the cold sparkle of ice. The floors of their lairs are often scattered with diamonds, moonstones, and quartz, as well as with silver and platinum coins, creating the impression of a river of stars when light spills across it. Though white dragons still value gold and copper, they usually bury such metals in pits filled with rock or snow to keep their yellow gleam from spoiling the look of their lair.
	The greater part of a white dragon's hoard consists of trophies taken from defeated foes. Although these trophies include items such as mighty weapons or ornate regalia that are valuable treasures in their own right, they can just as easily be worthless junk. A white dragon hoards trophies not for their material value, but as testaments to the dragon's dominance. An ancient white dragon's lair is a literal memory palace and a maze of rime-encrusted treasures that recount the story of the dragon's many victories.

White Dragon Art Objects:

1 | A war horn carved to resemble a dragon's head with a wide-open maw, which the dragon calls "Little Toot"
2 | A statue depicting an elf paladin with the face turned upward; the body has been defaced by the dragon's claws
3 | A mammoth tusk engraved with images depicting the history of a nomadic tribe; the dragon uses the tusk to mark the spot where it has buried its pile of gold
4 | A giant-sized cloak decorated with silver braiding that the dragon uses as a nest lining for its egg
5 | A wooden throne heaped with furs; any visitors must sit on the throne while the dragon recounts the grisly death of the seat's previous owner
6 | A huge wooden door carved and painted to depict a monarch enthroned with sword and scepter; the dragon occasionally raps the door with its knuckles, pauses, and then chortles, "Nobody home"
7 | A frost giant jarl's crown with broken horns; the dragon enjoys perching the crown on an icy stalagmite and then knocking it off with its tail
8 | The prow of a ship carved to look like a pouncing lion; the dragon occasionally roars at the lion
9 | A gilded shield emblazoned with the holy symbol of a forgotten god; the dragon enjoys flicking the shield with a claw to hear the sound it makes
10 | A ceremonial anvil of dwarven make; gazing at the anvil, the dragon fondly recounts, "Seven at one blow!"
11 | A long, embroidered linen tapestry showing the history of an ancient realm's civil war; the dragon "reads" the tapestry when it has trouble sleeping.

    </legendary>
    <description>Glasyadriel is the youngest of the known dragons. This adult white dragon resides in the tall peaks of the Giantfrost Mountains. The dragon had a rather unfortunate run-in with Jarma Polaris and his Reavers where both parents of the dragon were slain, and Glasyadriel lost her right claw. When the dragon discovered giant ruins high up in the mountain, still filled with the riches of an ancient giant warlord, the ferocious dragon claimed the treasures for themselves. Glasyadriel is the most visibly active of the dragons and can often be seen circling the Giantfrost Mountains, occasionally tormenting giants and travelers alike, stealing any precious belongings.
	Glasyadriel has developed a strong hatred of both humans and giants, both of whom have attempted to kill them on multiple occasions. Recently, a host of giants from Stonerest ascended the great mountains to kill Glasyadriel. Their bodies are now known as the Forest of Giants, as the entire hunting crew now stand frozen in place along the mountainside. Glasyadriel keeps them there as a warning to anyone bold enough to approach their lair.

Adult White Dragon:
The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.
	A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.

Primal and Vengeful: White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.
	A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warnings to intruders.
	Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.

Lone Masters: White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.
	White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.
	Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.

Treasure Under Ice: White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.
	Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.
	A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.

Dragons:
True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
	Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
	Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
	True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

Dragon Age Categories:
Category | Size | Age Range
Wyrmling | Medium | 5 years or less
Young | Large | 6-100 years
Adult | Huge | 101-800 years
Ancient | Gargantuan | 801 years or more

Chromatic Dragons:
The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.

Driven by Greed: Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

Creatures of Ego: Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

Dangerous Lairs: A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
	Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

Queen of Evil Dragons: Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
	Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
	Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.

    <description>Duchess Beatrice Atwood is a human noble in her late twenties. She has dark brown hair done up in a bun at the back of her head. Her face is sharp and angular with a thin nose, pointed chin, pursed lips and narrow eyes. She often wears a long gray skirt, a white blouse, and a black overcoat. She is a stern negotiator and exceptionally clever. She often dresses for her role as grand Ambassador, opting for neutral tones and smart fashion rather than anything overbearing or ostentatious.

	• Personality Trait. I am a forceful conversationalist and hardline negotiator. In an argument, I never let others get a word in edgewise. Don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.

	• Ideal. Elyria is the greatest nation in the world. Our foes are envious of our mighty nation, and often hypocrites who seek one-sided concessions from us at every turn.

	• Bond. I have two young children. Recently, I have noticed strange occurrences and happenings around my estates, and I'm greatly concerned they might be mageborn.

	• Flaw. The other people of the world should think and act more like Elyrians, and we have little to learn from their faithless ways.

Beatrice has ruled Michael's Gate for the past six years. Previously she was in training to become a Silver Order paladin, and showed potential as both a cunning warrior, and clever diplomat. Now, with two young children to take care of, and the responsibility of ruling Michael's Gate, she has set aside her warrior days. Her new life of politics and leadership are no less fraught with conflict, however.
	Recently her two children have begun to cause strange sights and sounds around her home with no reasonable explanation. Beatrice is concerned they may be developing mageborn qualities. Terrified of facing this possibility, she has greatly ignored the signs and kept her concerns a secret. Unbeknownst to Duchess Atwood, the mages of the Amethyst Academy have already determined her toddlers are mageborn. Once they reach the age of six, the purple-robed mages will come to take them off to Paradox Castle.

Noble:
Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.
	The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.

    <description>This wizened old archmage of the Amethyst Academy resides at Starspire Observatory. She has held her position for nearly two centuries, having used magic to extend her natural lifespan. Delilah diligently manages the observatory's students and faculty, but is intensely devoted to the collection and study of astrology, the cosmos, the planes, and theories about time and space. Perhaps the greatest living expert on astronomy, she is a studied academic who has a tendency to talk for hours on end about any topic she is excited about.

Personality Trait. I speak endlessly and in great detail about the stars, cosmos, and celestial bodies. They fascinate me deeply.

Ideal. A journey into outer space should be the Amethyst Academy's most important goal.

Bond. Zodiac has been an incredible mentor. I am honored to be counted amongst his friends and will do everything in my power to follow his teachings.

Flaw. I can't keep my mouth shut and am terrible at keeping secrets. I just love to tell people things.

Delilah is among the only mages outside the Academy Directorate that Zodiac confides in and discusses matters with regularly. The two are close friends despite the giant's misanthropic nature.

Archmage:
Archmages are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption.
	An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.

    <description>Headmaster of Paradox Castle
Rupert is a human archmage in his late sixties. He has a bushy brown beard, and a thick curled mustache that spans the entire length of his face. He has large circular glasses that cause his eyes to look much larger than they should. He is a hefty man who wears elegant purple robes and a pointed purple hat. He is always smiling and his bellowing laugh echoes through the chambers of his school. He adores the Academy Stronghold and loves meeting and pranking the students. Headmaster Greywell has a tendency to speak in riddles, and half-true jovial warnings. Many a new student is often put off at first when Rupert chuckles "Stay clear of the necromancy section in the library at night, unless you don't mind being possessed!"

Personality Trait. I love riddles, trivia, and curiosities. I adore the look of wonder on a student's face when they are unprepared for the magical madness that is my castle. Always play with their minds!

Ideal. Being a wizard takes years of hard work and dedication, but what's the point of all that work if you can't have a bit of fun with it!

Bond. My students and faculty are my family. I would protect them with my life, every single one of them. If you are here at my castle, you are the most important person in the world to me.

Flaw. I don't take anything as seriously as I should, and often overlook obvious problems and danger.

Rupert loves his job, and is admired by the students and faculty of Paradox Castle. However, the Directorate does not love his quirky and rambunctious attitude, and have been waiting for him to slip up for years so they can replace the headmaster. Rupert however, is not a dullard, and knows well the opinion his higher ups have of him. He has a cunning intellect and mind for politics that many do not expect, and carefully treads the line of being regarded by his staff and students as carefree, fun-loving, and a joy to work with, while also making sure he stays well within the guidelines, rules, and structure laid out by the Academy. Whenever he is asked to answer to the Directorate, Rupert comes prepared with ironclad documents and signed papers to prove all his claims, ensuring the Directorate cannot find a sliver of a reason to justifiably remove him.

Archmage:
Archmages are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption.
	An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.

    <description>Greta is a lively elder commoner of the Kinland Hills halfling community. She is the elected mayor and is a local sage to the people of the smallfolk community. Greta is a halfling woman in her mid-seventies and has held her mayoral position for almost thirty years. She is well-loved by the people and is regarded as a kind and caring individual, welcoming to all people, and exuding love and compassion to everyone she meets. Greta has established the Kinland Hills as a welcoming place for smallfolk to escape the many wars of Caspia, Elyria, and Westemär.
	Standing four feet tall, Greta is a rotund elderly woman. She often wears a brightly-colored yellow dress. The lovable mayor has an old wooden cane she uses as a walking stick, and curly, frizzled, brown hair, full rosy cheeks, a round nose, several chins, and a large warm smile that pushes her cheeks up into her bright green eyes.

Personality Trait. I naturally speak to everyone as if they were my dear children, offering hospitality and kindness to anyone and everyone. It doesn't matter what sort they are —
everyone deserves a friendly welcome.

Ideal. Kindness in abundance will never steer you wrong. The world is dark enough. We should strive to be a light for those we meet.

Bond. I want to build a peaceful community for those seeking a simple life. There ain't many places left in the world for someone to kick up their feet, tend to their fields, and rest their mind. I just want to protect what we have here.

Flaw. I refuse to see evil in people. Others can easily take advantage of my kindness.

Greta wants nothing more than to live her days surrounded by love and kindness. She aims to protect Kinland Hills as long as she can, and continue to offer a safe home for her halfling brethren.

Commoner:
Commoners include peasants, serfs, slaves, servants, pilgrims, merchants, artisans, and hermits.

    <description>Gwenavere is the older sister of Divine Matriarch Mercy V. She is a wispy noble woman in her early fifties who often wears colorful gowns and opulent headdresses. She carries many symbols of the Sacred Flame at all times to present herself as a devout worshiper of the faith, though she could never muster up the patience and will to cast divine spells as a Flamekeeper. She is exceptionally proud to have her sister as the Divine Matriarch, and everyone in Elyria knows it. She holds the title of her kin over everyone's head and uses it as a justification for her to be treated as though she were royalty.

	• Personalty Trait. I take every opportunity to mention my sister, her importance to the nation of Elyria, and in turn express my own importance.

	• Ideal. Position, wealth, and power are all that matter in this world. If you can have your grip on all three there is nothing stopping you from achieving anything you want.

	• Bond. It's wonderful that my sister is the Divine Matriarch, but it means that our family will need to fight all the harder to hold on to everything we've gained.

	• Flaw. Though 1 was raised to follow the Sacred Flame from a young age, I don't care for the religion. I find the whole matter boring and tedious.

Gwenavere desires nothing more than to help maintain her family's newfound power, and grow her own importance within Elyria. She is a cunning and manipulative woman who will take any and every opportunity to undermine and deface anyone who speaks ill of the Divine Matriarch, and will use her public image to ruin anyone who attempts to get in the way of her family and their name.
	For all this, Mercy V does not get along well with her sister. The Divine Matriarch finds the way her sister flaunts her status arrogant and unpleasant, and Gwenavere herself finds her sister's great faith tiresome and overbearing.

Noble:
Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.
	The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.

    <description>Elara Jones is an anomaly in her family: the household is not normally known for being particularly faithful or zealous. However, Elara nonetheless found herself called to the faith at a young age, and departed her household as a teenager. She returned years later as a devout warrior-priest of the Sacred Flame having spent many years in Elyria under the mentorship of the Divine Matriarch. Now in her early thirties, she has retired from adventure, and taken up the mantle as High Flamekeeper for the High King of Caspia. However, thanks to her new station, she has now become entangled in the politics which drove her to leave Caspia in the first place.

Personality Trait. I speak slowly and calmly to ensure I am understood. I often feel like Caspians yell and shout like wild animals, so a firm but soft voice often puts them in their place.

Ideal. Strength is one thing, but having a good head on your shoulders and knowing how to use it will take you much further in Caspia than you might expect.

Bond. I live by the tenets of the Sacred Flame, which I hold in higher regard than my household. Still, as both a noble Caspian and High Flamekeeper, I am burdened with many responsibilities, and must uphold my obligations to the faith, the crown, and my house.

Flaw. I sometimes talk down to Caspian men when I find their pig-headed nature exhausting or absurd Elara uses her words of wisdom to sway High King Venus Joplin II towards a righteous course, and also towards favorable outcomes for her family in political matters. Long has the High King contemplated invading Westemär now that the kingdom is weakened, and it has been Elara's urgings that have prevented that from happening.

Flamekeeper:
Every monastery, chapel, cathedral, and shrine to the Sacred Flame is watched over by a Flamekeeper. These white-robed women guided by their faith are known throughout the nations to aid the downtrodden, protect the innocent, and perform religious ceremonies of many types. Occasionally Flamekeepers will join Silver Order knights on holy expeditions, or as envoys for the Sacred Flame, joining battlefields and wars as protectors, healers, and symbols of the Faith.

    <description>Venus Joplin is an imposing woman in her late fifties. She has broad shoulders, a square face with defined features, and black pixie cut hair. She has almond shaped brown eyes and narrow lips. She wears a thick breastplate with open arms to accentuate her muscular strength. Her cape is emblazoned with the crest of her house, and she wears a circlet with a single sapphire gem placed in the center.

Personality Trait. I let my actions speak for me, and am a woman of few words. I know my house's worth, and I treat each Caspian as their house demands. Which means some I speak to as equals, and some I speak to as inferiors. Mostly inferiors.

Ideal. I am always the strongest and bravest person in the room. To say you are a great warrior is one thing, to be one takes guts.

Bond. House Joplin is the strongest Caspian house; the evidence is in the history books. I will hold the title of High King until I die, and on that day, my daughter will take my place.

Flaw. I do not care for the petty squabbles of my fellow houses.

I am rude and demeaning to the other Caspian Houses when I feel they are not living up to my expectations of what a Caspian house should be, which is basically always. Venus has held tightly to the role of High King for nearly three decades, and does not plan on relinquishing her title at the next Kingsmoot. Although she is well-loved by her people, and spoken of highly in tales and songs of her incredible victories, great monster hunts, and amazing arena duels, the other houses often dislike her, or are intimidated by her. She often enjoys this fact and revels in being the greatest Caspian warrior since Rex himself.

    <description>Uriel Radley is a lanky but incredibly fit man. He has wispy, unkempt, dirty-blonde hair that falls down just past his shoulders, and he keeps a blonde trimmed beard and mustache. The man has a prominent chin and dark sunken eyes of piercing sky blue. His angular jaw and thick brow give him a stern and brooding appearance. He is often found wearing his shimmering full plate armor with a large waving blue and white cape, and a matching large tower shield both emblazoned with the symbol of the Sacred Flame. His left pauldron is in the shape of a large griffon head; highlights of gold and white decorate the armor.
	His warhammer, aptly named The Judge, is renowned for its many battles, and passed down amongst the High Paladins. It is a massive silver warhammer with a white hilt filigreed with gold with a head shaped like a griffon.

Personality Trait. I do not suffer those who turn their backs on the faith or seek evil ends. I speak sternly and directly, often quoting scripture to guide my words.

Ideal. I am judgment, I am the flame, and those who spend their days writhing in the shadows should fear the light I bring. I am staunchly loyal to my people, I will defend innocence with my life, and I will vanquish evil and deliver swift judgment to the fiends and monsters of this world Bond. My role as the leader of the Silver Order is something I take very seriously. Elyria needs me, and I will stop at nothing to do right by the Sacred Flame, the Divine Matriarch, and the legacy of Saint Tarna.

Flaw. I see the world in absolute terms. You are either on the side of righteousness and good, or you are on a path to evil. If I cannot alter that path, then you receive my final judgment.

Uriel Radley is a stoic commander known to be brutal in battle, but fiercely loyal to his people. He very much wants to be remembered like the great saints of legend. Not for fame or glory, but for upholding his oath to the Sacred Flame above all else and protecting Elyria and the continent from the evils seeping out of the shadows. The tales of spreading corruption and otherworldly horror has planted the idea in his head that it is his duty to see these problems solved, with him and his soldiers at the heart of that resolution.
	Uriel sent his best friend and protégé, Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal to Drakkenheim. He imagines that the skilled captain might one day take his place as High Paladin once he retires from the role.
	Uriel despises arcane magic and sees mageborn as problematic at best. Though he is a righteous man, and upholds the values of the Edicts of Lumen to the letter, Uriel dreams of the day he can unleash the Judge upon the members of the Directorate of the Amethyst Academy.

    <description>Although the term "ranger" has often been used to describe lone hunters on the fringes of society, or great groups of warriors from the jungles and forests, the Hooded Lanterns are renowned for their mastery of urban environments, military strategy, and skilled marksmanship. The talents and accuracy of the Hooded Lanterns has allowed them to survive and maintain a foothold in the ruins of Drakkenheim, arguably the most dangerous environment in the entire continent.

    <description>Gloria is a young Silver Order paladin who made the rank of Knight-Captain early in her career, and has been a strong leader since. She has long blonde hair often worn in a tight ponytail and narrowed green eyes. Her round face and pleasant demeanor give her an air of kindness that can be disarming to many at first, but the kind exterior hides her cunning and strength that comes out any time she speaks.

	• Personality Trait. I do my best to be welcoming and kind to those 1 speak with, but I speak loud and firmly to hold the attention of those around me and I know how to command a room.

	• Ideal. It is our duty as knights of the Silver Order to uphold the tenets of our faith and help those in need. We go where we must and do everything we can to spark the Sacred Flame in the hearts of those we aid.

	• Bond. The world can be a dark place, and I joined the Silver Order to help bring a little more light into it. It is my sworn duty to provide a light to those wandering the darkness, and help them find their way.

	• Flaw. I assume the best in everyone, and believe that everyone has good in them.

Gloria is extremely proud of her position as KnightCaptain and wants very much to give the Silver Order a good reputation amongst those devout to the Sacred Flame, but even more importantly, those who are not. She sees good deeds, acts of kindness, and helping those in need as an important job for the Silver Order as every person they help is more likely to look to the Silver Order with kind regards, and in turn, become more open to the ideals of the Sacred Flame.

Silver Order Paladin:
The knights of the Silver Order are world renowned as the defenders of the Faith of the Sacred Flame. Taking on holy quests and religious missions for the Divine Matriarch, these holy knights have been known to ride griffons into battle, or march forth in force armed with plate mail, swords, and shields, and divine magic to bolster their combat prowess. To some, these paladins have a reputation of being divine protectors, noble warriors, and divine symbols of the Faith. To others, they are a terrifying and ugly example of the power of the Sacred Flame.

    <description>The presumptive heir to House von Baden, Verona von Baden is a cunning human spy with many connections spread throughout Westemär. She is an athletic woman in her early twenties with wide brown eyes, tightly curled black hair, and soft features. She is known as having a good eye for money and is well-versed in politics and trade. She is responsible for many of the diplomatic arrangements, political discussions, and negotiations with other cities and rulers. Verona von Baden is often dressed in a white button up with a brown leather vest, dark trousers, and swashbuckling boots. She carries a shimmering rapier with an ornate golden hilt with an engraving of her family crest upon it. Like her father, she is an avid sailor and ship captain. Her own caravel is known as the Rose of Thorns, a ship built from rosewood with an ornate carved bouquet as its figurehead, white sails, and armed with canons. She has been at the helm of many sea battles, and her swift ship is known and feared by many.

	• Personality Trait. I am a careful listener and observer, knowing what to say to make people around me feel at ease, and get what I need out of them. Kindness is a master manipulator.

	• Ideal. Money can't buy you happiness, but the more of it you have, the less you need to worry. Having strong allies and good cash flow is the recipe for a happy life.

	• Bond. I am the best negotiator and smartest leader this city has ever had, and will prove myself invaluable to the people and my father.

	• Flaw. My overconfidence and desire to do things myself has seen me in over my head on multiple occasions, whether it be with a pirate's sword to my throat, a political debate, or captured by otherworldly monsters.

Verona Von Baden has positioned herself as an incredible leader, both in naval expeditions and battles, but also in political debates and trade. She hopes to not only claim the duchy of Drannsmund after her father steps down, but prove to the people of the city her value as their leader. In doing so, she believes that if no successor is found to rule Westemär, her connections and alliances will ensure she will be the most obvious choice.

Spy:
Rulers, nobles, merchants, guildmasters, and other wealthy individuals use spies to gain the upper hand in a world of cutthroat politics. A spy is trained to secretly gather information. Loyal spies would rather die than divulge information that could compromise them or their employers.

    <description>Many nobles of the great nations of the continent lead their own soldiers into battle, or set out on heroic adventures and diplomatic missions. Especially in the lands of Caspia, princes and princesses are more often than not trained and skilled combatants, looking to make their mark as a scion of their house.

    <description>This catfolk warrior has led the Lion Guard for the past decade. Still deemed a newcomer to the elite warriors of Orleone, she proved herself in a battle she led against the black dragon Bitterheart, who ventured across the borders from the Eastern Vales looking for farmland to desolate. Lava carries several scars to show for it.
	A catfolk in her mid-thirties, she has lush yellow and orange fur that matches her yellow cat-eyes and a stern look on her face. She wears many piercings through both her ears and is often dressed in the red and brown leather strappings of the Lion Guard.

Personality Trait. I am always suspicious and on high alert;
every sound, every movement could be a danger. I never remove my hand from the hilt of my blade.

Ideal. It's better to be prepared for anything, and suspect that everything is a trap, that way you will never be surprised.

Bond. The ancient traditions of the Lion Guard have been part of Orleone for centuries, and I plan to live up to the position granted to me, and protect the people I love dearly.

Flaw. I am quick to draw my blade at nearly any possible slight or stir. Some people have called me jumpy, or overly aggressive.

Lava is still relatively new to her position and has a lot she feels she needs to prove. Although most of the Lion Guard looks up to her, there are a few older warriors who do not like taking orders from someone much younger than them. Lava takes the whispers about her and occasional comments of her age and position to heart, and is very eager to prove herself.

Lion Guard:
The Orleone Lion Guard were instrumental in defending their homes against the ruthless Kristoff Karn, who attempted to invade the small forming nation. These skilled martial artists use their agility and speed to outmaneuver their enemies, and lay out a relentless barrage of attacks against their foes.

    <description>The leader of the Hooded Lanterns is Lord Commander Elias Drexel. He is a large, gruff man in his early fifties. He is well-built and imposing, with a grim frown on his wide, angular face. His harsh features are framed with a thick mustache, side chops, and a mane of long braided brown hair. He is often garbed in chainmail with heavy leather gloves and boots, worn under a fur-lined dark green cloak and iron pauldrons, upon which is firmly clasped the Lord Commander's Badge.

	• Personality Trait. I seldom take time for niceties and pleasantries. I prefer people to be direct and to the point.

	• Ideal. I am loyal to my soldiers and expect the same in return. I do not often trust outsiders, but if they show their worth, I will treat them like my own.

	• Bond. My past is wrought with bloodshed and loss; and I feel intense guilt for every warrior who has died under my command. I seek redemption by staying true to what the Hooded Lanterns represent.

	• Flaw. I avoid talking about my past failures, and if it comes up I am quick to anger.

Elias Drexel leads the Hooded Lanterns' mission to reclaim Drakkenheim and uncover a worthy successor to the throne of Westemär. He would love to have the financial support of House von Baden, but has a complicated relationship with Ludwig von Fritz, as the two were bitter foes during the Civil War. The Lord Commander receives moderate support from House Kleinkessel and the rulers of Geldstadt and Altbruke in his mission.
	The Lord Commander orchestrated the original failed incursions into Drakkenheim before the Civil War broke out, and during the war itself, he fought for Mannfred von Kessel. However, when Mannfred made it clear he no longer intended to retake Drakkenheim after the war, Elias Drexel secretly seethed over the lives lost there in vain. The Lord Commander joined the plot to assassinate Mannfred and his heirs, but did not expect Cecilia von Kessel to die soon after. Now, Drexel believes strongly it is his duty to make amends for the mistakes he caused. At the time he believed he was doing the right thing, but since the apparent end of the von Kessel line, he was left with nothing to fight for. The Hooded Lanterns represent a new purpose for Drexel, and a way to right the wrongs of his past.


Hooded Lantern Ranger:
Although the term "ranger" has often been used to describe lone hunters on the fringes of society, or great groups of warriors from the jungles and forests, the Hooded Lanterns are renowned for their mastery of urban environments, military strategy, and skilled marksmanship. The talents and accuracy of the Hooded Lanterns has allowed them to survive and maintain a foothold in the ruins of Drakkenheim, arguably the most dangerous environment in the entire continent.

    <description>Lord Regent Polonius Reed is the most prominent figure amongst the Elyrian nobility, and sits at the head of the Parliament of Lords. Though a distant second to the authority and influence of the Divine Matriarch, he nonetheless holds much sway over the military and economic decisions of the nation.
	Polonius is a burly man in his early sixties. The noble has a round, full face with a thick beard and short black hair combed over his balding head. His shaggy eyebrows highlight his deep-set, dark brown eyes. He dresses in exquisite silk Elyrian jackets, complete with a frilled ruff, puffed sleeves, and gold filigree. He is a clever and persistent man who carries himself with an air of importance.

	• Personality Trait. I relish in a good heated discussion. I find the skills of diplomacy and debate are best honed with an oldfashioned argument.

	• Ideal. I can argue any point convincingly, regardless of its truth. Feelings are more powerful than facts when it comes to politics.

	• Bond. Elyria needs strong leaders — such as myself — if it is to remain the greatest power in the continent.

	• Flaw. I am bull-headed when someone refuses to see my point, and refuse to admit I'm wrong. I must always have the last word in any argument.

House Reed has strived for years to pave a clear path for one of their daughters to possibly become the next Divine Matriarch. Now, they have a promising prospect in the Lord Regent's daughter, High Flamekeeper Ophelia Reed. Ophelia is currently attached to the Silver Order's deployment in Drakkenheim, and the Lord Regent hopes that should his daughter successfully aid in the purging of the city and bringing Lucretia Mathias to account, House Reed will be well positioned to take both the regency and the Divine Matriarchy in the years to come.

Noble:
Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.
	The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.

    <description>Stari is the third of his name and has ruled over Orleone for about thirty years. He is a middle-aged noble catfolk who resides in the Palace of the Lord in Esnier. He has a great orange mane and yellow fur. His eyes are a piercing crimson and he is draped in a flowing red cloak. He wears a golden circlet of glittering ivy leaves encrusted with pearls from the Auroral Reef off the coast of his city. Stari often carries a golden scepter that is said to have magical properties that protect him from harm.

Personality Trait. I hold my head high when I speak to others and enforce my words with authority and gravitas.

Ideal. One must always present themselves in the manner they wish to be perceived. I will never show weakness, and I will never show fear or frailty.

Bond. My people rely on me. I am one of the few, if not the only non-human ruler of any nation. I am proud of my ancestry, my home, and my people, and I will do all 1 can to keep Orleone a prosperous and united kingdom.

Flaw. I am harsh to people, especially my own family. I am always concerned with politics and leadership, and forget to enjoy the small moments.

Stari is a proud man and stresses endlessly about doing what is right and just for his people and his nation. He struggles to please everyone and has been known to come off as harsh or stern as he constantly tries to make rulings that best suit all parties. Many like Stari, but both his grandfather and father were regarded as the best rulers Orleone had ever had, and many worry that Stari is being crushed under the weight of his bloodline.

    <description>The Lurker on the Threshold is a vile and maniacal being, drifting into our realm through thin places and screaming in the minds of those it witnesses. It laughs in hysterical dissonant tones and peers out with its three unblinking dark pools of eyes, with a mass of fleshy tendrils dangling from its slimy form. It ripples with black voidlike hues and splashes of deep purples and blues as if its flesh was a moving image of the cosmos.

    <description>Marigold is an Academy Director, and possibly the most mysterious of them all. This two-and-a-half foot gnomish woman is about as wide as she is tall. She has curled yellow hair that falls about her round rosy face. She is always beaming with a large smile, red dimpled cheeks, and an abundance of chins. She has a round nose and big bright eyes; one is green, the other is a strange crimson red. She carries a short staff made of iron laced with golden swirls.
	Marigold wears a wide-brimmed, pointed, purple hat and a well-fitted purple Academy tunic. She is always a delight to be around and many Caspians admire her optimistic attitude and overt friendliness.

Personality Trait. I speak in excited and friendly tones and am always looking for an opportunity to help out. No one suspects a jovial gnome!
Ideal. Tricking mortals is so easy, you just need to smile and nod and occasionally throw in a mild request and a quick illusion and you can bend them to your will.

Bond. No one suspects the truth of my presence here, and I will continue to play this role and pull the strings of the Amethyst Academy as I see fit.

Flaw. I am reckless and care little for those around me. My friendly facade is merely another illusion.

Marigold is a master of illusions and has been known to occasionally pull pranks and small jests on the High Kings of Caspia, and even the Academy Directors. Behind closed doors, Marigold has been heard muttering in deep whispers of unknown languages to herself. She vanishes every night when her duties are done, and even goes weeks or months without communicating with the other Academy Directors. She has spoken briefly of her walking castle, but no one is sure what she refers to, and assume it is another jest.
	Marigold has been working in secret to study how delerium affects illusion magic. She hopes to create a means of making illusion spells function like summoning spells — conjuring up an illusion and infusing it with delerium to give it form and make it real. If she can master this new advancement, she will be able to create any object, reshape landscapes, manifest riches and items, and reshape reality in ways hitherto unheard of.

    <description>A great bear of a man, Martyn Mac Lochlann is the chieftain of Darryl, and the mightiest warlord in Skye. This human reaver has a mane of long reddish-brown hair that goes down past his shoulders, a thick beard with a gray patch at the chin, bushy eyebrows, and wild sky-blue eyes. He is typically clad in animal pelts and furs, and has tattooed arms like tree trunks bearing druidic symbols. Standing almost eight feet tall and weighing nearly six hundred pounds of pure muscle, he is an intimidating beast to behold.

Personality Trait. I adore stories of glorious battle, and revel in retelling and reliving the great myths of my people and our gods.

Ideal. Through signs and portents, the Old Gods guide my path and destiny. If I am to lead Darryl to a prosperous future, it is by their will.

Bond. The druids have guided my family for generations, and I do not stray from their teachings or rituals.

Flaw. My superstitious beliefs have gotten in the way of my goals in the past. I often wait for the correct alignment of stars before performing a task, or hold off on a battle until I can hunt a boar in the name of Kromac.

When charging into battle, Martyn often paints his face with woad and bear blood and drinks mead from a goblet carved from a skull. He claims the skull belonged to his traitorous brother. Martyn keeps close relations with the Druids of Kromac and Nodens, and often seeks the elders for guidance and direction in his political dealings. However, he is a deeply spiritual and superstitious man, and frequently partakes in blood rituals and midnight seances.

Reaver:
Many of the northern warriors have adopted the title "reaver". Donned in animal furs, wielding axes, and painting themselves with blood, these brutal warriors rage in to battle with an unrelenting ferocity. Many reavers believe they are closely tied to nature, the elements, and the wild animals of the places they inhabit. Whether it be the Netherwind Reavers, or the Northfolk from Skye, these terrifying warriors are infamous for their brutality.

Its pink flesh is caked with thick patchwork tufts of fur, with three gangly long arms that end in long bony fingers with talon like claws. Rather than a head, the top of its massive body has two beady rodent-like eyes and rat-like features. Upon its belly is a large gaping maw filled with jagged teeth and a massive purple tongue slurping and slathering gobs of vile saliva out of it as it drags itself towards its next meal.

      <text>Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath the sands.
	Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon's first line of defense.
	A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions-along with the wealth of the dead intruders.</text>

      <text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

	• Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.

	• A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	• Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.</text>

	• Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (-5).

	• Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 × 10 feet into the sinkhole.

If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.</text>

      <name>Blue Dragon Lairs</name>
      <text>Blue dragons make their lairs in deserts and other arid landscapes. They prefer warm climates, but if an otherwise ideal potential lair presents itself in a cold environment, they find ways to adapt. Instead of seeking out lofty domiciles, blue dragons build their lairs underground, burrowing beneath sand or using magic to hew rock into an intricate warren of rooms and tunnels that can be expanded to accommodate a growing family. Still, they appreciate the tactical advantages of height and usually create their lairs near a spire or cliff from which they can keep watch over their territory.
	Though most blue dragons would be loath to the use the term themselves, their lairs are often surprisingly homey. They favor lairs that balance beauty and comfort and adorn them in soothing shades of blue, purple, and green.

      <name>Additional Lair Actions</name>
      <text>At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) blue dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

	• Misleading Mirage: Until initiative count 20 on the next round, at each intersection or branching passage in the lair, a creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.

	• Sudden Sinkhole: The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A 5-foot-radius, 20-foot-deep pit forms centered on that point. A creature on the ground above where the pit formed must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature falls to the bottom of the pit, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone. On a successful save, a creature moves to the nearest unoccupied space instead of falling in the pit.

      <name>Additional Regional Effects</name>
      <text>Any of these effects might appear in the area around a blue dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the Monster Manual:

	• Blue Luster: Creatures that spend a year within 1 mile of the dragon's lair find blue objects fascinating and feel compelled to acquire them at every opportunity.

	• Mirage Terrain: The area immediately surrounding the lair appears to be a lush oasis. A creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to disbelieve it. A creature who disbelieves the illusion sees it as a vague image superimposed on the underlying terrain.

	• Sandstorm: A sandstorm blows constantly within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.

      <text>Blue dragons have strict standards for what treasures they allow into their hoards and reject valuable objects that don't meet those standards. One blue dragon might keep only treasure that coordinates visually with the other items in the hoard, while another might focus on artwork from a particular period or seek out jewelry made for rulers in a certain region. Blue dragons' hoards are an enormous source of pride, and these dragons are insulted by offerings that don't meet their standards.
	Blue dragons favor blue, purple, and green gemstones; art depicting oases and fountains; and fine textiles in cool colors. They also love scents that evoke storms and rain, and magic items that produce weather effects.

Blue Dragon Art Objects:
d8 | Object
1 | An intricately carved seal from a civilization that worshiped the dragon's ancestors as gods
2 | An extensive collection of elaborate jewelry, including a tiara, tail rings, and claw covers, which the dragon wears when meeting with supplicants
3 | A set of sculptures depicting the dragon's deceased relatives, all adorned with ground-up jewels
4 | A jeweled mosaic map of the dragon's territory
5 | A glass bell that creates the sound of rainstorms and thunder for 1 hour when struck
6 | An ornately tooled tome recording the lineages of all the blue dragon families in the area
7 | A massive geode that contains spectacular blue, purple, and black crystals
8 | A blue silk fan painted with ground gems that creates a briny breeze when hung from the ceiling

    </legendary>
    <description>Greatest among the dragons of the Pale Tooth Mountains is Opularis the Wise, an ancient blue dragon. The scholarly dragon keeps a great library within the ruins of an ancient monastery. They are said to be the most welcoming of all the known dragons of the continent. Several grandmaster wizards of the Amethyst Academy meet Opularis for games of chess and afternoon tea, and once every century, the dragon takes on a mortal apprentice.
	However, Academy professors are quick to warn headstrong pupils about seeking the dragon's mentorship: Opularis does not teach amateurs, beginners, or raw talents. The dragon has been known to slay any would-be student who cannot impress them by casting three different spells of 6th level or higher.

Ancient Blue Dragon:
Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert's reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.
	A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.
	A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.

Vain and Deadly: A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.
	A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant.
	When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm's reach as it waits to attack again.

Desert Predators: Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.
	When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.

Overlords and Minions: Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.
	A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.

Hoarders of Gems: Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelry and magic items adorned with those gems.
	A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.

Dragons:
True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
	Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
	Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
	True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

Dragon Age Categories:
Category | Size | Age Range
Wyrmling | Medium | 5 years or less
Young | Large | 6-100 years
Adult | Huge | 101-800 years
Ancient | Gargantuan | 801 years or more

Chromatic Dragons:
The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.

Driven by Greed: Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

Creatures of Ego: Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

Dangerous Lairs: A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
	Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

Queen of Evil Dragons: Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
	Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
	Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.

    <description>Prince Abdalla is the current head of House Laurent. He is a human noble man of some forty years. He has short, tightly curled black hair, large brown eyes, brown skin, and a full face, with piercings through his nose and several along one ear. He wears a golden chain with the symbol of Arwyn the Moon Hunter as a pendant, but is an avid follower of the Old Gods and holds worship to Danu, Lugh, and Nodens as well. The prince wears a crown fashioned out of golden reeds upon his head and wears a yellow robe with red lining.

Personality Trait. I speak often of the Old Gods, of their blessings, and look for signs and omens in the natural environments around me.

Ideal. Terene is a free nation, where people may worship as they choose, live as they choose, and be who they choose.

We do not squabble or dissolve into infighting as the "great"
nations of the continent often do. We protect our borders and defend our lands from those who wish to bring their version of "civilization" to our peaceful kingdom.

Bond. My family has protected these lands, stood at the front lines of all our wars, and worshiped the gods who created this jungle and gave us this place to call home. I aim to continue their legacy as a leader and a prophet to my people.

Flaw. I often read dark omens in the clouds, moon, and plants, and sometimes make drastic choices hoping to appease the gods.

Noble:
Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.
	The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.

    <description>Mars is a slender liege with black hair and a prominent thick unibrow across his furrowed brow, a thick black mustache that covers his mouth, and thick sideburns. He is often clad in black half-plate that he and all the wyvern-riders wear, as well as a black helm with a red crest. Mars is rarely far from Duke, his black-and-red wyvern. There are many famous stories involving Mars and his uniquely colored wyvern rampaging over their enemies. Mars is almost inseparable from the beast, and many say he loves it more than his own children.

Personality Trait. I speak in a biting, strong tone, and often use analogies of battle and blood to make my points.

Ideal. True friends stab you in the front. Honesty is harsh, but in the end it's the best way.

Bond. To fly through the air and feel, for a brief time, what it's like to be free, is the most incredible feeling any man can have. We wyvern-riders will always be the freest, and most glorious of the Caspians. The others could never understand.

Flaw. I talk to my wyvern and love it more than anything else and would die to protect it.

Mars is less concerned with the Kingsmoot than he is building up his military strength. He has a growing vendetta against the people of Terene, and is often jealous of their Clawstrider rangers. He is focusing all his energy training more wyvernriders to push into the neighboring lands to capture and tame the giant lizards of the jungle. His goal is to build a force of both mounted ground and aerial troops that puts all other Caspian houses to shame.

Liege:
Many nobles of the great nations of the continent lead their own soldiers into battle, or set out on heroic adventures and diplomatic missions. Especially in the lands of Caspia, princes and princesses are more often than not trained and skilled combatants, looking to make their mark as a scion of their house.

    <description>Neptune is a middle-aged man with a bushy blonde beard and a bald head. This gladiator has a burly build, and unlike many of the Caspian Princes, rarely wears armor. Instead, he is known for sailing the Middle Sea in his leather tricorn hat, a sea-swept beige tunic, and a large belt with a silver skull for a buckle. He has tattoos covering his arms and back detailing every monster he has claimed to have slain, including a kraken, a dragon turtle, and most important to him, a great white sperm whale who devoured his original crew. Neptune is known to be a ruthless commander in combat, and takes endless joy in downing pirate ships and plundering them of their stolen goods. He is often accompanied by a pet ferret he calls Pip.

Personality Trait. I use naval jargon and sailing analogies whenever I talk. I curse often, and have little mind for manners.

Ideal. Go where the wind takes ye, and always be ready to fight for what ye believe in.

Bond. I may not be a trueborn scion of House John, but I was brought into this family all the same. I have proven myself my own brand of warrior. No one can take my title, or my victories away from me. I'm still waiting for a thank-you from Joplin for keeping the Middle Sea safe for our people.

Flaw. If anyone mentions my bloodline as not being a true heir to the throne of Caspia, I'll stick 'em with my saber a few times to show them my Caspian ways.

Neptune John wants to win the next Kingsmoot to stir the pot of Caspian royalty, and rub it in the face of the other houses for thinking low of him. Most Caspians are loud and proud with their shining armor and big swords, and not used to seeing a tattooed pirate amongst their people. Currently Neptune has been detailing plans to slay the great Leviathan of the South Ocean, which would surely claim him some votes in the Kingsmoot.

Gladiator:
Gladiators battle for the entertainment of raucous crowds. Some gladiators are brutal pit fighters who treat each match as a life-or-death struggle, while others are professional duelists who command huge fees but rarely fight to the death.

    <description>Sol is a ninety-year-old barrel-chested liege who is almost always wearing his shining decorated armor. He wears a red cape with several small motifs of his family's crest upon it, and he sports a great white beard and slicked back hair. He is tall and muscular, sporting an envious physique for a man half his age. He speaks in a booming voice, and often spouts tales of glorious battle and exaggerated monster hunts.

Personality Trait. I take every opportunity to speak of my great deeds and the deeds of my house. People need to know that although the Jacksons have yet to win a Kingsmoot, we are still one of the strongest houses in Caspia.

Ideal. Every Jackson needs to know three things: how to swing a sword, when to swing a sword, and how to tell everyone how good you are at swinging a sword.

Bond. My family is important to me. I push them to do great deeds to achieve glory for our house.

Flaw. I often talk over people and completely ignore what they say. I much prefer the sound of my own voice anyways.

Sol is a boisterous and proud man who will never say a bad thing about his house or his family. He spends most of his time bragging about their deeds and ensuring everyone around him knows how great the Jacksons are. In truth, the upcoming Kingsmoot has Sol on edge. His house has never won a single Kingsmoot and at ninety years old, his time is running short for him to claim being the first Jackson to ever take the throne of the High King. Since he started swinging a sword, Sol determined himself destined to be the first Jackson on the throne, and wants that title more than anything. If he does not win the upcoming Kingsmoot, he doubts he has another decade left in him.

Liege:
Many nobles of the great nations of the continent lead their own soldiers into battle, or set out on heroic adventures and diplomatic missions. Especially in the lands of Caspia, princes and princesses are more often than not trained and skilled combatants, looking to make their mark as a scion of their house.

    <description>Persephone Joyce is a middle-aged noble woman who wears white robes similar in fashion to those seen within the clergy of the Sacred Flame, but greatly embellished with gaudy Caspian baubles. She often wears gold jewelry to contrast her white attire and mimic the colors worn by the Divine Matriarch. Persephone fancies herself very in tune with the teachings of the religion, and she attends the cathedral in Joyce Harbor every day.

Personality Trait. I offer guidance and wisdom with my words, and aid those who would turn away from the Sacred Flame by gently pushing them in the right direction towards

Ideal. Caspians should take their inspiration more readily from righteous figures like Saint Tarna, not uncouth warlords like Rex Caspian.

Bond. My faith has proven a valuable ally to me and I believe that as long as I work under the guidance of the Flame, I will always be moving in the right direction.

Flaw. I believe the Sacred Flame guides my every choice, and so I rarely question the wisdom of my actions.

Persephone is aiming to take the seat of High King in the next Kingsmoot, tear down the Rex Colosseum, and construct a great cathedral in its place. She dreams of turning the Tower of Swords into a holy site of worship, and sparking the Sacred Flame throughout all of Caspia. She has wild ambitions this would unite Caspia and Elyria as a unified force, and fancifully imagines her and the Divine Matriarch as two pillars of the Faith working together to spread truth and justice to the continent.

Noble:
Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.
	The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.

    <description>The current Queen of Eladria, Genevieve Autumnfall, is an elven mage with platinum hair, wide-set bright blue eyes, a long neck, and long, thin arms and legs. She wears faded brown robes interwoven with spun gold, and crown set with jewels to resemble red, yellow, and orange leaves upon her head.

Personality Trait. I very carefully think out my words before I say them, making sure they are important and impactful.

Ideal. I believe the elven people came to this world for a reason, and that reason was more than to just forget who we were and fade away.

Bond. We might never know where we came from, but my people deserve a place to call home.

Flaw. I am hopeful to a fault. I refuse to accept the end of the elves, and believe strongly that no matter what, we will endure.

Genevieve has watched over the small community of elves for a hundred years. She wants nothing more than to create a kingdom for elves to thrive. However, she is welcoming to half-elves within her community as well. She wants to create a place where the elves can grow their population, and stop them from becoming the faded and lost memories like the ruins she calls home.
	Since the Isles of Skye are not a united nation, they were not an official party to the Edicts of Lumen. As a mageborn wizard, Queen Genevieve only holds her title thanks to the remoteness of her domain. As such, she is careful to remain relatively obscure lest she get dragged into the politics of the mainland.

Mage:
Mages spend their lives in the study and practice of magic. Good-aligned mages offer counsel to nobles and others in power, while evil mages dwell in isolated sites to perform unspeakable experiments without interference.

    <description>Many of the northern warriors have adopted the title "reaver". Donned in animal furs, wielding axes, and painting themselves with blood, these brutal warriors rage in to battle with an unrelenting ferocity. Many reavers believe they are closely tied to nature, the elements, and the wild animals of the places they inhabit. Whether it be the Netherwind Reavers, or the Northfolk from Skye, these terrifying warriors are infamous for their brutality.

    <description>Rickard Steelfang is a unique human lycanthrope whose curse renders him almost unkillable.
	Rickard is a massive man standing nearly 7 feet tall with broad tree trunk arms, a barrel chest, and a large potbelly. He has a mane of long, red, unkempt hair with a beard to match. He wears animal furs and a thick brown leather belt that holds up several daggers and two large axes. He speaks in a loud, boisterous, grizzled voice, and cares little for manners or etiquette. He swears and spits when he talks, and speaks his mind to just about everyone.

Personality Trait. I'll tell you how it is and then some. Don't expect honeyed words and a helping hand from me. You're more likely to get a swift insult and an axe in the back.

Ideal. Life is what you make of it. You gotta do the best with what you're given, and if you're good at something, never do it for free.

Bond. All of my pack are cursed and these folks can never go home again. The least I can do for 'em is give them purpose and pay to make their cursed lives worth a damn.

Flaw. I'm uncouth and vulgar to a point where most everyone I meet wishes they hadn't.

A ruthless warrior, his curse has caused him a life of bloodshed that he never wanted, but he has made the most of his situation and given up on fighting what he is, embracing his animal side fully. However, as the years march on, he has grown weary and considers searching for the means to break his lycanthropic curse.

Inherited Silver:
Rickard Steelfang's unique curse means that normal silvered weapons are not effective against him. Instead, the weapon must be made specifically from silver that was passed down to the wielder from a now-deceased friend or family member. The weapon need not be in the original form the silver was inherited in. For example, a character could make silver arrowheads or crossbow bolts by melting down a silver locket given to them by their grandmother.

    <description>Earl Orlando Timmins is a slight commoner man with goldyellow skin, well-dressed in a black-and-white silk tunic. He wears a heavy leather satchel overflowing with paper records and ledgers, and carries the Secretary General's Quill.

	• Personality Trait. I am soft-spoken, polite, and analytical, so others often ignore me. I keep my records with meticulous detail; nothing is unaccounted.

	• Ideal. I believe the Sacred Flame can lead us to progressive enlightenment, so long as our rulers do not keep us wallowing in the dark. We cannot forget how the Faith compels us to act with integrity and compassion in all things.

	• Bond. There are few moderate and open-minded leaders amongst our nobility today. We need such people to reverse Elyria's slow slide into theocracy.

	• Flaw. I hesitate to speak my mind or tell others uncomfortable truths, as I fear their anger, scorn, or retribution. My fears often cloud my reason.

The Secretary General is privy to all manner of sensitive information, so often the role is filled by a trustworthy and capable scion who lacks greater political ambitions. House Timmins is an Elyrian noble family known mostly for moneylending, but who have seldom been power-players in Elyria. Lord Regent Polonius Reed chose Orlando Timmins for this reason, but is quickly growing tired of the Earl's honest work.

Commoner:
Commoners include peasants, serfs, slaves, servants, pilgrims, merchants, artisans, and hermits.

    <description>The knights of the Silver Order are world renowned as the defenders of the Faith of the Sacred Flame. Taking on holy quests and religious missions for the Divine Matriarch, these holy knights have been known to ride griffons into battle, or march forth in force armed with plate mail, swords, and shields, and divine magic to bolster their combat prowess. To some, these paladins have a reputation of being divine protectors, noble warriors, and divine symbols of the Faith. To others, they are a terrifying and ugly example of the power of the Sacred Flame.

    <description>Commander Callisto, a male Scalebreaker knight, has looked after the Dragon Vault for thirty years as the head of the Scalebreaker Legion. He himself is noted for having slain the children of Amarodial "Bitterheart" the Black Dragon of the Eastern Vales when they ventured over the mountains into Caspian territory. That was some time ago, and now, over the age of seventy, Commander Callisto has retired from the battlefield and helps train new recruits. He is a strict commander who expects the best from his knights, and constantly reminds them that if they think he is too harsh, they will be sorely disappointed with how a dragon treats them.
	Callisto has short gray hair and keeps a gray stubble beard. He has an eyepatch over his left eye and three scars across his face — a memento from one of his earliest battles. Commander Callisto wears the same armor into battle each and every time, complete with its many burn marks, dents, and holes from draconic teeth and claws. He is missing his left arm after having lost it to a red dragon on the Drakeclaw Mountains years ago. Despite his injury he returned with the head of the dragon in tow. Anyone who has made a comment about his missing arm is thrown into the training pit with the commander, who challenges them to beat him in a duel. The Scalebreaker Commander remains undefeated.

Personality Trait. I am a stern man with a lot of wisdom from experience. I speak harshly and honestly. In battle there is no place for niceties.

Ideal. I train the best, because anything less won't survive long enough to learn better.

Bond. The Scalebreakers are one of the most important forces in all of Caspia, we may not be nobles or High Kings, but you can bet on your life that they know they need us when the monsters of this world come crawling out of their holes.

Flaw. I am incapable of relaxing. I have been on my guard my whole life and constantly in battles. I don't know if I am capable of settling down.

Callisto has a long-standing rivalry with the black dragon Amarodial, who dwells in the Eastern Vales. He has faced the dragon several times and the two are well aware of one another. Since they are separated by the Rust Edge Mountains, their battles have subsided for many years. Still, Commander Callisto dreams of facing the dragon once more. If he is to die, he would rather it be in the jaws of that treacherous beast than lying in a bed.

Scalebreaker Knight:
The Scalebreakers are renowned Caspian knights trained specifically for dragon slaying, and monster hunting. They train for years to perfect teamwork, organized strikes, and unique combat tactics that make them a fearsome foe on the battlefield, or a competent ally.

    <description>Tower of Storms. On the eastern end of the city is a small rocky peninsula where a tall tower stands overlooking the bay. Court mage to House von Baden, master wizard Sundar Stormgale, a blue dragonborn mage, uses his evocation magic to operate the tower as a beacon for ships to make it into harbor safely during storms. The wizened dragonborn has a wispy white beard and wrinkled face. He wears uniquely-crafted spectacles and flowing purple robes.

Mage:
Mages spend their lives in the study and practice of magic. Good-aligned mages offer counsel to nobles and others in power, while evil mages dwell in isolated sites to perform unspeakable experiments without interference.

    <description>This horrific monstrosity is larger than a whale. It has a long, serpentine body bristling with sleek fins, undulating barbed tentacles, and rubbery purple-black flesh. It writhes through the waves with unearthly grace despite its bulk, and seeping from the flaps and vents within its skin come secretions of a thick, oozing oil which shimmers with prismatic hues. The monstrosity has a gigantic fanged maw which it holds agape. Seaweed, fish entrails, and slime dribble from between its sharp teeth, and its bulbous eyes glow with octarine light. It has adorned its brow with fishing nets, coral, sea debris, and delerium crystals, as if wearing a coronet and jewelry. As you look upon its form, you feel a slight headache, a buzzing in your ear, and a pressing in your chest; as if the psychic presence of this otherworldly creature has conjured up the crushing pressure of the abyssal depths.
	The Duchess is a contaminated sea monster that haunts the shores of Ash Bay (see Appendix A: Monsters for its game statistics and those of its minions). The creature originally made its home in the sewer cisterns of Drakkenheim. However, as the Duchess matured and grew larger, it departed the cursed city via the Drann River in search of more plentiful prey and fresh thralls, bringing a new wave of contamination to Ash Bay. It deliberately destroyed the Empress Geraldine just off the coast of Drannsmund; the merchant vessel was transporting a vast hoard of delerium to the far continent. The Duchess has slowly tended the new reef of delerium coral flourishing around the shipwreck, transforming it into a personal underwater palace.

	• Personality Trait. "What horrific condition afflicts the land-dwellers! How awful must it be that you cannot live and languish in the wonderful sea... such a terrible curse which keeps you bound to the land..."

	• Ideal. "My magic will weaken the curse which holds you to the land, so you might swim through the waves of my court, and be welcomed as one of my loyal subjects! Perhaps you will be worthy enough to become one of my valiant Knights!"

	• Bond. "Come see the wondrous treasures of my Grotto! Gaze upon the opalescent, prismatic beauty of my prized coral... you may hold it in your hands, for a while, if you wish...

	• Flaw. "I abhor the land, and will never set scale or fin upon it." The Duchess has powerful and otherworldly psychic powers.

They can communicate telepathically, read the thoughts of mortals, and turn mortals into its contaminated thralls. It makes deceptive offers that appeal to characters' deepest desires, manipulating them into embracing contamination. Those under its control slowly mutate, taking on horrific aquatic features.
	The Duchess has seized control over the population of Ashshaffen, where it summons its worshipers at the Salt Cove Shrine, an underground cavern beneath the ruined chapel in town. The monster is now slowly spreading its tendrils of influence over Drannsmund.
	Meanwhile, the creature has dispatched one of its more capable thralls to the Starwatch Lighthouse. There, the Duchess hopes to open a dimensional rift so she can conjure other beings like itself, styling itself no longer as a duchess — but an empress.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

      <name>A Green Dragon's Lair</name>
      <text>The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath. The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled.
	At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</text>
    </legendary>
    <legendary category="lair">
      <name>Lair Actions</name>
      <text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

	• Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.

	• A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.

	• Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.</text>
      <attack>Piercing Damage||4d8</attack>
    </legendary>
    <legendary category="lair">
      <name>Regional Effects</name>
      <text>The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

	• Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the 'thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns.

	• Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. 	• Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.

	• Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.

If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.</text>

      <name>Green Dragon Lairs</name>
      <text>Green dragons prefer making their lairs in verdant places—jungles, bayous, pine forests, or anywhere with abundant vegetation that they can shape according to their desires. An older green dragon might indulge in horticulture, cultivating the local flora as befits their individual aesthetic. However, most green dragons are content to either excavate beneath trees and nestle among the roots or make lairs inside trees large enough to be hollowed out without compromising their structure.
	Green dragons take great interest in woodland settlements when seeking lair sites. Though they are fully capable of modifying forests to their own liking, they find it easier and vastly more entertaining to take something belonging to smaller and weaker beings.

      <name>Additional Lair Actions</name>
      <text>At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) green dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

	• Creeper Vines: The dragon can use the vines and roots within its lair to animate up to three Humanoid corpses, which become zombies (see their entry in the Monster Manual). The zombies take their turn immediately after this lair action. Each one reverts to an inanimate corpse after 1 minute, when the dragon uses this lair action again, or when the zombie is destroyed.

	• Lashing Root: One large root or branch that is part of the lair makes a melee attack roll against a creature within 10 feet of it. It has a +7 bonus to hit and deals 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

      <name>Additional Regional Effects</name>
      <text>Either or both of these effects might appear in the area around a green dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of those described in the Monster Manual:

	• Inviting Whispers: Whispers rustle in the foliage within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The words are indistinct, but a creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or higher interprets them as an invitation to move deeper into the greenery.

	• Twisted Messengers: The dragon can cause any Tiny Beast within 1 mile of its lair to act as its mouthpiece. The effect is horrendous, as the creature's throat and mouth temporarily warp into a twisted version of the dragon's own in order to allow the dragon's voice to issue forth.

      <name>Green Dragon Treasures</name>
      <text>Green dragons relish gems and jewelry whose palettes reflect their chosen forest environments, favoring viridescent colors and bursts of floral brilliance. Many develop vast collections of emeralds and beryls as a result, punctuated by amber, red rubies, tiger's eyes, bismuth, and the like. They likewise covet finely crafted items and works of art depicting unspoiled nature.
	Unlike many of their kin, green dragons use the transformative power of nature to turn those valuables into truly unique treasures. By wrapping and threading treasures with rare vegetation and carefully applying their own skill as gardeners, green dragons meld nature and artifice into new masterpieces. This can lead to complications for would-be treasure hunters, as green dragons take enormous pride in their handiwork—so much so that intruders damaging the delicate arrangements of flower and vine that surround a treasure cache might come under attack before even touching any of the hoard's contents.

    <description>This adult green dragon dwelling in the Achtungwald is an elusive creature who has occupied the deepest and darkest center of the woods for hundreds of years. Trethysia narrowly avoided being drawn into the wars of House von Drakken, and has skillfully escaped countless Caspian dragonslayers. The dragon is a capable illusionist and can tap into the primal energies of the forest, and uses these powers to deceive and trick their foes and hunters. Now, they are quite content to live in solitude. There is an ancient ruined elven village in the heart of the forest that is said to be the dragon's home now, but from time to time the dragon is seen flying over the forests on raids, snatching livestock from the smaller farmsteads. However, Trethysia generally avoids direct confrontation with humans.
	Still, many a campfire story tells of the great elven treasures the dragon hoards inside those ancient ruins, and there are still those who remember Trethysia's treachery on the outskirts of Schaffburg, or the damage they did to the walls of Altbruke.

Adult Green Dragon:
The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible.
	A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.
	A wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.
	A green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.

Capricious Hunters: A green dragon hunts by patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry enough, but its favorite prey is elves.
	Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.
	A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.

Manipulative Schemers: A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires.	Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creature is only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.
	When manipulating other creatures, green dragons are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.

Conflict and Corruption: Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watchsometimes for decades-for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.
	Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, ores, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.

Living Treasures: A green dragon's favored treasures are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.

Dragons:
True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
	Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
	Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
	True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

Dragon Age Categories:
Category | Size | Age Range
Wyrmling | Medium | 5 years or less
Young | Large | 6-100 years
Adult | Huge | 101-800 years
Ancient | Gargantuan | 801 years or more

Chromatic Dragons:
The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.

Driven by Greed: Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

Creatures of Ego: Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

Dangerous Lairs: A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
	Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

Queen of Evil Dragons: Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
	Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
	Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.

    <description>Floating gemstones orbit about the head of this ancient and wispy elf archmage; their magic has sustained him for thousands of years. Valtar Banemoon is the hermetic lighthouse keeper, and has not left the lighthouse in millennia. He knows little of the world beyond, and even less about how he got here.

	• Personality Trait. I haven't spoken to anyone in... well, ever. If I got the chance, I would love to know everything about them and their world.

	• Ideal. I remember a time when many elves were here, and have dim visions of them passing through a faery-gate, anguished and tired, refugees from an unknown cataclysm which destroyed our world. I know not what has happened to them, but I hope beyond hope they are safe and thriving

	• Bond. I was charged to protect and guard this place, but why I cannot recall.... What was lost, that wondrous place... Acadia. The name is the only thing I can remember, and I hold on to that memory dearly.

	• Flaw. The pang of missing memory is palpable. I struggle to remember anything.

Valtar Banemoon has never had any visitors, and is uneasy about leaving his post. He knows that he was born on another world and traveled to this earth, but remembers nothing else of that time. If convinced to leave the lighthouse and enter the world, though, perhaps it may be possible to unlock his memory and learn the great mystery of the elven people.

Archmage:
Archmages are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption.
	An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.

Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps.
	With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.

	• A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

	• Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads a round corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn.

	Minions often attend red dragons in their lairs. These servants keep the place swept clean of refuse and watch out for intruders, while providing the imperious dragon with subjects to bully and command. Some minions worship the dragon and serve willingly, but others would escape if they could.

Red dragons favor items made of metal and stone, which can survive the test of time. Many such items in an ancient red dragon's hoard might be hundreds or thousands of years old. They tend to eschew treasures that burn, such as leather, paper, and cloth items.
	For a red dragon, every treasure is a mark of pride and a personal trophy. Like a proud hunter, a red dragon relishes telling the tale of acquiring each individual relic or coin, glorifying the dragon's own deeds.

    </legendary>
    <description>This ancient red dragon resides in the caldera of the Dragon's Maw. The dragon has lived here since before recorded history, and spends decades at a time slumbering.
	Vulmungoth rarely stirs in their lair. The caldera is so inhospitable, most would-be dragon slayers die scaling the volcano. Still, they emerge every century or so to slake their vast appetite, flying down into Elyria to consume mortals and their livestock. Their waking always follows great eruptions from the Dragon's Maw, and many towns and villages are destroyed. Thus, the locals living south of the Drakeclaws grow up with well-made plans for their evacuation and escape should the dragon return. During their last rampage, the dragon descended upon Holy Lumen in a horrible encounter that almost saw Saint Tarna's Cathedral destroyed.
	Vulmungoth is the last surviving dragon who was a part of the ancient Blood Pact, where the sorcerer-kings melded their bloodlines with draconic magic. Today many sorcerers and dragonborn can trace their distant ancestry to Vulmungoth.
	Shortly after the fall of the sorcerer-kings, a group of monks of the Sacred Flame attempted to ascend the Dragon's Maw and destroy Vulmungoth for their ties to the Arcane Empire. The dragon devoured most of them. Only a small handful of monks made it off the mountains. The resounding defeat ended the organized attempts by Elyria to defeat the Doom of the Mountain.

Ancient Red Dragon:
The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures.
	The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.
	The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.

Mountain Masters: Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hilldwelling copper dragons from time to time.

Arrogant Tyrants: Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.
	No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.

Status and Slaves: Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.
	When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.

Obsessive Collectors: Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.
	A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.

Dragons:
True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.
	Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.
	Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.
	True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

Dragon Age Categories:
Category | Size | Age Range
Wyrmling | Medium | 5 years or less
Young | Large | 6-100 years
Adult | Huge | 101-800 years
Ancient | Gargantuan | 801 years or more

Chromatic Dragons:
The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.

Driven by Greed: Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.

Creatures of Ego: Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.

Dangerous Lairs: A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.
	Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.

Queen of Evil Dragons: Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.
	Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship herblack, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.
	Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.

    <description>Jarma leads the Netherwind Reavers, leading them into battle against giants, dragons, and even the occasional battle with the Ironhelm Dwarves over the rich mountain resources to the south. They are a 9-foot-tall half-giant and wield a colossal greatsword carved with Jordic runes. They have a flowing mane of white hair and bushy white eyebrows that frame their pale gray skin and sunken piercing blue eyes. They wear the pelt of a mammoth across their back.

Personality Trait. I do not speak often to outsiders if I can avoid it. I know that I can intimidate just about any so-called champion from the south, and my silence is often my greatest weapon.

Ideal. To fight is to live, and to live for a Reaver, is to fight.

Bond. Ilove the north, and want to make my mother proud. She was a great warrior herself, and so I strive to be as good as she was.

Flaw. I enjoy mead and ale a little too much, and rarely say no to a good fire, some fresh brews, and stories of battle.

Jarma is torn between two worlds. The giants of Stonerest abandoned the half-giants years ago, and claimed they are not welcome in Stonerest any longer. Since then, Jarma's kind have found acceptance among the human settlements of Netherwind. Jarma looks up to their mother, Berna Icewyrm, a giant who once led great battles against dragons. Jarma wants to make her proud more than anything, but was deeply saddened when she did not leave Stonerest with them when they were banished. Jarma is happy to defend their new home, but they still hope to one day end the war of the giants and be with their mother again.

Reaver:
Many of the northern warriors have adopted the title "reaver". Donned in animal furs, wielding axes, and painting themselves with blood, these brutal warriors rage in to battle with an unrelenting ferocity. Many reavers believe they are closely tied to nature, the elements, and the wild animals of the places they inhabit. Whether it be the Netherwind Reavers, or the Northfolk from Skye, these terrifying warriors are infamous for their brutality.

    <description>Xel'vohca the Ancient is one of the eight Amethyst Academy Directors, and the Archmage of Elyria. The Academy Director Lich has held his position since the Amethyst Academy was founded, and was among the principal architects of the Edicts of Lumen. Indeed, since the time the Edicts were being drafted, the Divine Matriarchs have known about his undead nature, though they must tolerate this uncomfortable truth under the terms of the agreement.
	Even still, Xel' vocha's undead nature is not immediately apparent; aside from the High Paladin and the Divine Matriarch, the other members of the Elyrian Cabinet are not aware Xel'vohca is a lich. Upon first meeting he appears as an old man in an ornate wheelchair of strange metal, attended by his personal shield guardian. He has drooping jowls, sallow skin, sunken octarine eyes, wispy white hair, and an expression of deep sadness upon his face. He wears a simple purple robe and carries a glass-encased delerium orb. Except to incant his magic, Xel'vohca no longer speaks and relies on telepathy to communicate.

	• Personality Trait. I communicate telepathically in strained and long-winded streams of consciousness, my mind constantly burdened with centuries of thoughts.

	• Ideal. Magic can do great things. Terrible things, but great things indeed. We must wield it with responsibility, but wield it we must.

	• Bond. I was there when the first warlocks made their ancient pacts. The burden of the original sin of magic rests upon me, and I will steward the inheritors of the arcane until the last sun goes out at the end of eternity. I think of all mages as my children, and the sorcerer-kings were my wayward sons and daughters. I cannot repeat those mistakes.

	• Flaw. Though my undead heart no longer beats, it pains me to feed my phylactery and sustain myself. The memories of these stolen souls haunts me, so I only do so rarely. As a result, my body has greatly atrophied, and now I fear my mind is slipping into madness as well.

Xel'vohca was both the first warlock and the first lich. Far from an evil creature, Xel'vohca has spent thousands of years facing the consequences of the choices he made in life. He is older than recorded history, and was vizier to many of the sorcerer-kings, though he was unable to stop their tyranny. His existence has often been spent trying to make amends for the failures of his past, but this task grows ever harder as new conflicts arise. The destruction of Drakkenheim and the

Lich:
Liches are the remains of great wizards who embrace undeath as a means of preserving themselves. They further their own power at any cost, having no interest in the affairs of the living except where those affairs interfere with their own. Scheming and insane, they hunger for long-forgotten knowledge and the most terrible secrets. Because the shadow of death doesn't hang over them, they can conceive plans that take years, decades, or centuries to come to fruition.
	A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh stretched tight across its bones. Its eyes succumbed to decay long ago, but points of light burn in its empty sockets. It is often garbed in the moldering remains of fine clothing and jewelry worn and dulled by the passage of time.

Secrets of Undeath: No wizard takes up the path to lichdom on a whim, and the process of becoming a lich is a well-guarded secret. Wizards that seek lichdom must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul entities. Many turn to Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, whose power has created countless liches. However, those that control the power of lichdom always demand fealty and service for their knowledge.
	A lich is created by an arcane ritual that traps the wizard's soul within a phylactery. Doing so binds the soul to the mortal world, preventing it from traveling to the Outer Planes after death. A phylactery is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but it can take the form of any item possessing an interior space into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver.
	With its phylactery prepared, the future lich drinks a potion of transformation-a vile concoction of poison mixed with the blood of a sentient creature whose soul is sacrificed to the phylactery. The wizard falls dead, then rises as a lich as its soul is drawn into the phylactery, where it forever remains.

Soul Sacrifices: A lich must periodically feed souls to its phylactery to sustain the magic preserving its body and consciousness. It does this using the imprisonment spell. Instead of choosing one of the normal options of the spell, the lich uses the spell to magically trap the target's body and soul inside its phylactery. The phylactery must be on the same plane as the lich for the spell to work. A lich's phylactery can hold only one creature at a time, and a dispel magic cast as a 9th-level spell upon the phylactery releases any creature imprisoned within it. A creature imprisoned in the phylactery for 24 hours is consumed and destroyed utterly, whereupon nothing short of divine intervention can restore it to life.
	A lich that fails or forgets to maintain its body with sacrificed souls begins to physically fall apart, and might eventually become a demilich.

Death and Restoration: When a lich's body is broken by accident or assault, the will and mind of the lich drains from it, leaving only a lifeless corpse behind. Within days, a new body reforms next to the lich's phylactery, coalescing out of glowing smoke that issues from the device. Because the destruction of its phylactery means the possibility of eternal death, a lich usually keeps its phylactery in a hidden, well-guarded location.
	Destroying a lich's phylactery is no easy task and often requires a special ritual, item, or weapon. Every phylactery is unique, and discovering the key to its destruction can be a quest in and of itself.

Lonely Existence: From time to time, a lich might be stirred from its single-minded pursuit of power to take an interest in the world around it, most often when some great event reminds it of the life it once led. It otherwise lives in isolation, engaging only with those creatures whose service helps secure its lair.
	Few liches call themselves by their former names, instead adopting monikers such as the Black Hand or the Forgotten King.

Magic Collectors: Liches collect spells and magic items. In addition to its spell repertoire, a lich has ready access to potions, scrolls, libraries of spellbooks, one or more wands, and perhaps a staff or two. It has no qualms about putting these treasures to use whenever its lair comes under attack.

Undead Nature: A lich doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>This hermetic storm giant Academy Director is one of the eight members of the Amethyst Academy Directorate. Standing thirty feet tall with a flowing midnight-blue beard and pale blue skin, he carries a colossal staff carved from the trunk of an elm tree, topped with a boulder of elemental gemstones.
	Zodiac performs most of his research at Starspire Observatory, where he has spent centuries cataloging and monitoring the stars and cosmos. Zodiac rarely interacts with other mages in the observatory, and usually only speaks to the other Academy Directors. His oldest friend and former apprentice Delilah Willowart manages the day-to-day administration of the observatory, as Zodiac hates being disturbed and is quick to anger when someone interrupts him.

Personality Trait. I only speak to those I deem worthy of hearing what I have to say, but lightning crackles in my eyes and my voice booms like thunder when I do. Very few people are worthy of my attention, and I do not care for small talk, japes, or trivial matters.

Ideal. I am the most powerful mage in the Amethyst Academy and expect to be treated as such. Monarchs, high priests, and common folk alike are but squabbling pests who should kneel before the might of my magic.

Bond. I honor the Edicts of Lumen, but think the treaty is nonsense. Mages deserve to take their place as the true rulers of the world.

Flaw. I am completely vexed by how 1 did not see the meteor on its way to Drakkenheim long before it appeared in the night sky. I grow furious and indignant when others question me about it.

Zodiac has long known that small delerium crystals can be found powering rare ancient elven artifacts in Skye. He has had some larger deposits sent to him from Drakkenheim to compare samples. Meanwhile, the elusive mage has tapped into the thin places upon the Island, and is attempting to create controlled doorways to other timelines using delerium. Zodiac wants to explore not only other worlds, but the past and future as well. In particular, he would love to travel back in time to watch the arrival of the elves, and learn how they made the Elfgates to travel between distant planets.
