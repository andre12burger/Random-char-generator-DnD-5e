        <name>Divine Domain: Shadow Domain (HB)</name>
        <text>Clerics of the Sacred Flame know that life is at all times a balance between the light and the dark. Most clerics uphold the flame, whose divine purpose is to hold back the darkness, and offer guidance to those who pass on. Clerics of the Shadow Domain are in tune with the dark side of the divine. They stand to balance all things, practicing the powers of shadow against their enemies. They know that not all deserve the light, and so sending foul horrors to the shadows is their form of righteous justice.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Channel Divinity: Cloak of the Night (Shadow Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke protective shadows.
	As an action, you draw upon a curtain of magical shadow which lasts for 1 minute. When you do, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to be enveloped by the cloak of the night (which can be yourself). While the cloak lasts, that creature has resistance to all damage while it is in dim light or darkness.
	In addition, when you draw the cloak of night, all nonmagical light sources within 60 feet of you become extinguished. Magical light sources are dispelled if they were created by a spell with a level equal to or lower than your proficiency bonus.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Shifting Shadows (Shadow Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>You can twist shadow around other creatures to pull them through space.
	As an action, you can target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you that is in dim light or darkness. You teleport that creature up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. The chosen space must be on a surface or in a liquid that can support the target without the target having to squeeze. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC is unaffected.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

You only die if you do not regenerate on your turn. Additionally, you do not age while you are in darkness.
