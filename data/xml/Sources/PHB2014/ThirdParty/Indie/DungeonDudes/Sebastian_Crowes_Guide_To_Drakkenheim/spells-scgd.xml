    <text>Until the spell ends, acid rain falls in a 40-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is lightly obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.
	Chemical pools accumulate on the ground in the area, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 3d6 acid damage and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone in the pools, taking an additional 3d6 acid damage.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the acid damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell. When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

You banish a creature that you can see within range into the Space Between Worlds. Upon this roiling plane of chaotic potential, the target wanders incomprehensible vistas searching for a way back via strange and absurd exits. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes.
	The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes an Intelligence check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends. On a failed check, the target takes 4d6 psychic damage.
	When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.
	Time passes differently for the target within the Space Between Worlds, and it perceives its time spent there as having lasted hundreds or perhaps thousands of years, even if it was only gone for rounds or minutes in the mortal world.
	A creature which dies in the Space Between Worlds does not return.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell. When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

You create two Large hands of shimmering, octarine force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hands last for the spell's duration. Both hands move at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hands.
	Each hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If one or both of the hands drop to 0 hit points, the spell ends. Each hand has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0) and occupies its space.
	When you cast the spell, and as an action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hands up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with each. Both hands can perform the same action, or different ones. The two hands must move to remain within 30 feet of each other.

	• Arcane Slam. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 necrotic damage. If you direct both hands to attack the same target, they gain advantage on the attack roll.

	• Forceful Throw. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it. If both hands are used against the same target, you can throw them ten times your spellcasting ability modifier, and gain advantage on the check against a Large or smaller target.

	• Eldritch Grip. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If both the hands are used against the same target, they can grapple a creature regardless of its size, and you have advantage on the grapple check against a Large or smaller target.

	• Contaminated Crush. You can have a hand crush a target it is grappling. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, the target must make a Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Contamination Level. If both the hands are grappling the same target, you can have them rip the grappled target limb from limb. They deal an extra 4d12 necrotic damage.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the arcane slam and contaminated crush options increases by 2d12 and the damage from the eldritch grip increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.

You weave contaminated energy to temporarily imbue a creature within range with a beneficial mutation. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains that effect until the spell ends.

	• Strength. The target has advantage on Strength attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. The target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, its melee weapon attacks deal an additional 2d6 necrotic damage for the spell's duration.

	• Constitution. The target has advantage on Constitution checks and saving throws. The target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, it gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for the spell's duration.

	• Dexterity. The target has advantage on Dexterity attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. The target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, its attacks with ranged and finesse weapons score a critical hit on an 18–20 for the spell's duration.

	• Intelligence. The target has advantage on Intelligence ability checks and saving throws, as well as spell attack rolls. The target can also choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, for the duration of this spell, while the target is concentrating on a spell it has cast, it's concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.

	• Wisdom. The target has advantage on Wisdom ability checks and saving throws, as well as spell attack rolls. The target can also choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, for the duration of this spell, it gains blindsight to a range of 60 feet and can't be surprised while it is conscious.

	• Charisma. The target has advantage on Charisma ability checks and saving throws, as well as spell attack rolls. In addition, the target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, for the duration of this spell, when the target makes a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, it can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can choose one additional effect for every two slot levels above 2nd.

The mushrooms emit toxic spores, and any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the mushroom patch must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 poison damage for each mushroom in the patch and is poisoned until the start of its next turn.
	Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause an additional mushroom to sprout within the patch.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, one additional mushroom sprouts with the initial patch for each slot level above 4th.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell. When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

You call down eldritch falling stars that crash into the earth at four points you can see within range. Each creature within a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 10d6 radiant damage, 10d6 necrotic damage, 10d6 thunder damage, 10d6 psychic damage, and 10d6 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one burst is affected only once.
	The falling stars leave lasting contamination in the areas they affect, which lasts for one hour. A creature that starts its turn within the affected area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 5d6 necrotic damage and gains 1 Contamination Level. It takes half as much damage and does not gain any Contamination Levels on a successful save. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage immediately undergoes a Monstrous Transformation as if they had gained 6 Contamination Levels.
	The spell damages structures and objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell. When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

This spell transforms a willing creature that you touch into a horrific monstrosity. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.
	The new form can be an aberration with a Challenge Rating of 4 or lower.
	The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen aberration. It retains its alignment and personality.
	The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.
	The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
	The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
	In addition to a delerium fragment worth 100gp, you must provide either the heart or brain (or equivalent organ in the case of aberrations with a truly alien physiology) taken from a creature of the same type: the organ must either be recently harvested or magically preserved via gentle repose or similar magic. As part of casting the spell, you drive the delerium fragment into the organ, and both are consumed by the spell. The Game Master determines if an aberration's physiology makes its organs suitable for use with this spell.

    <text>You summon a roiling wind of flesh devouring disease and excruciating blood boiling fumes that sweeps over the area emanating from you in a 120-foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw a creature takes 5d8 poison damage and 5d8 necrotic damage or half as much damage on a success. After taking this damage, any affected creature with 25 hit points or fewer remaining immediately dies and is reduced to a weathered skeleton as their flesh and soft tissue blows off like ash.

You seize upon the flow of time around up to three creatures of your choice within range, drawing seconds from them to use them yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.
	An affected target can't take reactions. On its turn, it must choose to either move, take an action, or a bonus action: a target can do only one of the three.
	A creature affected by this spell can spend its action to try to pull back the threads of time. If it does, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.
	While at least one other creature is affected by this spell, you gain an additional action on each of your turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Cast a Spell, Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. If you use this action to cast a spell, that spell must be a cantrip with a casting time of one action.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell. When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

You call forth a contaminated elemental to do your bidding. Choose air, earth, fire, or water. Eldritch energy conjures a contaminated elemental of the chosen type, which appears in an unoccupied space within range: either an animated sludge (water), entropic flame (fire), living haze (air), or walking geode (earth). Each uses the summoned delerium elemental stat block below, but gains different traits based on the chosen element used to conjure the elemental. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
	The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration of the spell. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys any verbal command you give it (no action required by you). If you don't give any commands, it attacks the closest hostile creature it can see, moving towards it by the most direct route.
	The elemental doesn't disappear if you lose concentration on this spell. Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it attacks you. An uncontrolled elemental can't be dismissed by you, and it remains until it is destroyed.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

Perhaps it is the favoured cat of Phantasia, or a fragment of Shegorach, but to others, it is simply known by the odd name "Bruce".

You call forth The Thing with the Writhing Tail. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the stat block of "The Thing with the Writhing Tail" in the Bestiary. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
	The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger. 

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

	The potent poison lingers in the targets body and pulls it towards death. A target reduced to zero hit points by this poison damage automatically fails death saving throws until it finishes a long rest. A heal or greater restoration spell cast on the target also ends this effect.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell. When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

This spell allows you to control gravity in a 100-foot-cube centered on a point within range. When you cast this spell and at the start of each of your turns for the spell's duration, you decide which direction gravity pulls within the area. All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall in the direction you choose until they reach the edge of the area. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.
	If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the edge of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.
	Alternatively, you can decide to prevent gravity from acting within the area. When you do, creatures within the area levitate in midair, and must move by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows them to move as if they were climbing. Unattended objects float around randomly.
	At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.
