        <text>Some warlocks gain their eldritch power from the very cosmos, answering to entities of space, the constellations, planets, and moons. A warlock swearing fealty to a Cosmic patron typically believes they speak to gods, or god-like beings, but these entities are shrouded in mystery, their appearance incomprehensible and horrible, and their divine power is bestowed into the warlock from the stars and galaxies beyond.

        <name>Cosmic Attributes (Cosmic Patron (HB))</name>
        <text>You take on an otherworldly cosmic appearance or essence. Choose one or more of the attributes listed below, decide your own, or roll randomly to determine how the cosmic powers bestowed into you take form.

Cosmic Attributes:
d6 | Cosmic Attribute
1 | Your eyes become pools of inky black with small galaxies floating within them. To look into them is as if floating through the cosmos lost in the void of space.
2 | Your touch becomes cold as ice and your skin becomes pale. Some might think you undead or sickly. You appear as if you had died in the cold of space.
3 | Your voice has a slight echoing nature to it. As if there is more than one entity speaking through you. Your own voice is most prominent but when listening carefully one can make out a chorus of celestial voices speaking through you.
4 | You give off a faint smell of ozone — acrid and sulfuric, as if lightning had just struck nearby. It seems unnatural and otherworldly.
5 | You develop a third eye in the middle of your forehead that is unblinking, and seems to pierce into people's minds as it stares upon them.
6 | Your veins glow with a soft radiant light, giving you the appearance of a walking constellation of stars and cosmic energy.

        <text>Beginning at first level, you learn the eldritch blast cantrip if you don't know it already. It doesn't count against the number of warlock cantrips you know. When you cast eldritch blast, you can have it deal radiant damage instead of force damage.

        <text>You can speak, read, and write Celestial and Deep Speech. In addition, you learn the guidance cantrip. It doesn't count against the number of warlock cantrips you know. Additionally, you may cast the spell augury once without expending a spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

        <name>Orbit (Cosmic Patron (HB))</name>
        <text>Once per turn when you miss a creature with eldritch blast, the beam returns to you as an orbiting comet around your head. While you have an orbiting comet, you can absorb its energy to do the following:

	• Cosmic Power. Once on your turn when you cast eldritch blast, you can consume one orbiting comet to fire an additional beam.

	• Interception. You can use your reaction to intercept a melee or ranged attack, gaining resistance to the damage from that attack.

	• Lightspeed. As a bonus action, you can consume a comet to teleport 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. 

You can have a maximum number of orbiting comets equal to your proficiency bonus. As long as you have comets, you glow with bright light out to 20 feet, and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The comets last until you finish a short or long rest, or until you dismiss them (no action required).

        <name>Otherworldly Patron: Flesh Patron (HB)</name>
        <text>A Warlock of the Flesh has made a pact with an entity so alien and unknown that its mere existence is enough to cause madness in most people. These warlocks have allowed an alien entity to inhabit their bodies, answering to some ancient and eldritch thing from beyond comprehension. This entity creates a symbiotic relationship with the host, granting them powers while reshaping and twisting their form.

        <text>As an action, you can take on a reshaped form, which lasts until you become incapacitated, use an action to change back, or use this feature again. When you do, choose from one of the reshaped forms below:

	• Inverse Kneecaps. Your legs become more powerful, and your knees now bend the opposite direction. While in this form, you increase your walking speed by 10 feet, and you can double your long and high jump distance.

	• Aquatic Attributes. You grow gills and your skin becomes slimy, the flesh between your fingers and toes becomes webbed.

	• While in this form, you can breathe underwater, and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

	• Natural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. You can use your Charisma modifier for attack and damage rolls.
	The damage of your unarmed strikes increases as you gain levels in this class: 2d6 damage beginning at 10th level, and 3d6 damage at 14th level.

        <name>Body Modification (Flesh Patron (HB))</name>
        <text>When you choose your reshaped form, you can choose any two options available to you.
	You gain the following additional options when you take on a reshaped form.

	• Gelatin Bones. Your skin looks loose and saggy as you struggle to maintain your structure. You can now fit into spaces as small as one inch in diameter and gain advantage on Stealth checks.

	• Change Appearance. You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same. For example, if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal.

	• Combat Instincts. You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. In addition, your natural weapons and unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

	• Spider Claws. Your hands and feet grow strange mucus slicked insectoid features that allow you to climb surfaces. You gain a climb speed equal to your walk speed and can stick to ceilings as well without needing to make an ability check.

	• Aerial Adaptation. Feathered or batlike wings rip out of your back, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.

	• Toxic Fumes. A cloud of noxious gas seeps from your pores, you appear sickly, and green slime oozes from your pores. You have disadvantage on Charisma checks while in this form, but any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of you takes 2d6 poison damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

	• Hardened Skin. You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons.
