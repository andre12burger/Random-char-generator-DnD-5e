        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Arcane Hand (HB)</name>
        <text>Monks who practice the Way of the Arcane Hand have trained their bodies and souls to be attuned to the weave of arcane magic. They can harness those cosmic energies and use them to fuel their martial practices. Monks of this tradition, although not mageborn, have gained control over the rawest and most natural forms of power.

        <name>Spellcasting (Way of the Arcane Hand (HB))</name>
        <text>When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See Spell Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the wizard spell list.

Arcane Focus:
You can use a monk weapon as an arcane focus for your spellcasting.

Cantrips:
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.
You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Way of the Arcane Hand Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell thunderwave and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast thunderwave using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. The Spells Known column of the Way of the Arcane Hand Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of1st level or higher of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through contemplation and meditation. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

        <name>Eldritch Flurry (Way of the Arcane Hand (HB))</name>
        <text>Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of those attacks.
	When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action as a bonus action instead of making unarmed strikes. Finally, when you use your action to cast a spell, you may treat this as taking an attack with a monk weapon for the purposes of your other monk features.

        <name>Focus Power (Way of the Arcane Hand (HB))</name>
        <text>When you cast a spell, you can expend ki points to increase the level of the spell as if you'd cast the spell using a higher level spell slot. You must use a spell slot as normal to cast the spell, then expend 1 ki point for each level you increase the spell in this way. You can increase the spell's level higher than your highest-level spell slot to a maximum level equal to your proficiency bonus.
	For example, if you're an 11th-level Way of the Arcane Hand monk, when you cast the spell scorching ray using a 2nd-level spell slot, you could expend 2 ki points to cast the spell as 4thlevel spell.

Instead, the spell lasts up to 1 minute, or its maximum duration, whichever is shorter.

        <text>Master of the spear, this nimble warrior uses polearms not only as a weapon, but as an extension of themselves, using their weapon to amplify mobility, maneuverability, and combat. Like a snake in the grass, the Way of the Serpent hones one's ability to predict oncoming attacks, deflect from a distance, and strike with deadly precision.

        <text>You gain proficiency with the glaive, halberd, pike, trident, and similar spears and polearms. These weapons count as monk weapons for you, even if they have the heavy or two-handed properties. Furthermore, your grace and mastery of these weapons does not limit your ability to make unarmed strikes while wielding a two-handed weapon.
	While wielding a quarterstaff, spear, or trident in two hands, that weapon gains the Reach property.

	While wielding a weapon with the Reach property, when you expend a ki point to use your Step of the Wind feature, your jump distance is instead tripled for the turn, and you gain advantage on your next melee weapon attack you make this turn.

        <name>Serpent Strikes (Way of the Serpent (HB))</name>
        <text>You learn the following techniques to augment your attacks:

	• Cobra Strike. When a creature you can see moves into your reach, you can use your reaction to make one attack against that creature.

	• Python Strike. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can also use your Stunning Strike on that attack without expending a ki point.

	• Viper Strike. Once on your turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend 1 or more ki points, up to a number equal to your proficiency bonus. The attack deals 1d6 poison damage, plus 1d6 additional poison damage per ki point spent, and the target is poisoned until the end of your next turn.

	• Black Mamba Stance. While using this stance, once per turn when you miss with a weapon attack, you may make an additional melee attack as part of the same action.

	• Couatl Stance. While using this stance, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.
