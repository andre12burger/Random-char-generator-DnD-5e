        <text>Between the nations of Westemär, Elyria, and Caspia there have been countless wars fought. Many great knights, valiant soldiers, and powerful combatants have tested their mettle against man and monster alike. Amongst the brave there are always those who are born to lead, and the Commander is just that. They stand at the front of battle, uniting their allies and leading the charge against their enemies.

        <name>Battle Commands (Commander (HB))</name>
        <text>You can issue a battle command as a bonus action to an ally within 120 feet of you who can hear you. Choose one of the following commands:

	• Fight On! The target regains a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. The creature can't regain hit points from this command again until it finishes a short or long rest.

	• For Glory! The target can use their reaction to make a melee or ranged weapon attack.

	• Move It! The target can use their reaction to move up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

	• Never Falter! The target recovers from one charmed or frightened condition. Once a creature benefits from this command, it can't do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.
