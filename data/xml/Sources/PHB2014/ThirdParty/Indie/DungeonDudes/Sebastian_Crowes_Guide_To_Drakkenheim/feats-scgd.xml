    <text>Whenever you take a short rest, you and up to 6 allies can enjoy a quick meal prepared by you. When they do, any hit dice they use during that rest count as if they had rolled their maximum. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
	During a long rest, you can prepare a hearty meal for up to eight creatures using any ingredients at hand. Creatures who consume the meal gain a hearty resistance for 24 hours. While a creature has this hearty resistance, if that creature fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. It can use this benefit once, then the hearty resistance expires.

	• Poison trap. The triggering creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 poison damage and becomes poisoned until the end of its next turn.

	• Gas trap. The triggering creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated until the end of its next turn.

The saving throw DC for your traps equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
