Craft Components: 25 gp worth of materials typically found in a set of tinker's tools
Craft Time: 1 hour
Craft DC: 20

An arcane mine is an explosive devices designed to release the spell it contains when triggered by pressure or a tripwire. An arcane mine is typically buried just below the ground to conceal its presence.

Trigger: A creature that steps on an arcane mine or walks through the trip wire triggers it. The mine also triggers if it takes any damage or if a character rolls a 1 on the d20 when attempting to disable it.

Effect: The mine immediately casts the spell stored in it, centered on itself. The mine is destroyed by the spell.

Countermeasures: A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the trap-this DC increases to 20 if the trap is fully concealed. A successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables the trap.

Storing Spells: The following rules apply when storing a spell in an arcane mine:

	• Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the trap by touching the trap as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the trap.

	• Only evocation or necromancy spells that deal damage in an area of effect and force a target to make a saving throw can be stored in an arcane mine.

	• The stored spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and the spellcaster must expend a spell slot to cast it.

	• A spell contained in an arcane mine can be overwritten by a new spell only if the new spell is cast using a spell slot of a higher level than the stored spell. Otherwise, the new spell is expended without effect.

	• The save DC of a spell contained in an arcane mine equals 10 plus the spellcasting ability modifier of the original spellcaster.

	• Any spell stored in an arcane mine fades after 24 hours and is wasted.

    <text>This magic bow tests the virtues expected of a ranger. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

Hidden Effect: Three tiny gemstones are embedded in the bow's upper limb, one of which illuminates when each of the following conditions is met by the wielder:

Courage: Slay a legendary creature.

Commitment: Cleanse the wilderness of a corrupting influence.

Compassion: Make a great sacrifice to alleviate the pain of another.

When all the conditions have been met, the dynamis bow evolves into patience.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Proficiency: martial, longbow
