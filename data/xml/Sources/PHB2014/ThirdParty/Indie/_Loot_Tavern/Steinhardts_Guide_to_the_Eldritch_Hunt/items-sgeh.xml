    <text>This satchel contains various small implements that can bludgeon, cut, and pierce in ways designed to maximize pain. Meant to extract the truth, many use these tools with far more nefarious intentions. Proficiency with these tools grants the following benefits:

Exhaustion: Using these tools for 1 hour on a restrained creature causes them to gain 1 level of exhaustion, after which you must make a Dexterity (torture tools) check. The DC is equal to 20 - the creature's Constitution modifier. On a failure, the creature takes 10 points of your choice of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.

Intimidation: When you make an Intimidation check against a creature whom you used these tools against, you gain a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus + twice the level of exhaustion the creature has.

    <text>This basic technology invented by the Scions sacrifices lead bullets to generate powerful azure flames that scorch the abhorrent. This device is an effort to replicate the magical ability possessed by a select few.
	As an action, you can cause the damascena to project blue flames in a 15-foot cone in front of you. Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 11 + your proficiency bonus), taking 4d4 fire damage + a number of d4s equal to your proficiency bonus on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each use of the damascena consumes 5 lead bullets.

	Known for temporarily alleviating the effects of madness, the darker the tea, the more potent and challenging to brew. Once ingested, the afflicted individual is relieved of the affected madness for 1 hour or until the madness ends, whichever is shorter. However, upon swallowing the tea, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC listed in the table below. On a failure, you can't stomach the appalling taste, regurgitate the tea, and don't gain the benefits.
	The tea is made in kettles that can pour up to 2d4 cups.

    <text>A hand of glory is crafted from the hand of a hanged scourgeborne after it was covered in corpse wax and left to ferment in a casket.
	While holding the hand of glory, you can attune to one additional magical item. This magical item can only be a ring, and must be worn on the hand of glory.
	While holding the hand, you can use an action to set a digit of the hand ablaze and cast the invisibility spell on yourself. While a finger is ablaze, it casts bright light in a 10-foot radius that is only visible to the wearer of the hand. The spell ends early if the flame is extinguished by the wearer (no action required). In addition, while a finger is ablaze, you can cast the knock spell at will on objects within the radius of the light. The hand has 5 digits and regenerates 1 burnt digit daily at dusk.

    <type>P</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>The mostly-clear tonic in this vial is slightly milky and sparkles when light shines through. It was originally created by a secretive branch of the Radiant Church.
	When you drink this tonic, you regain 4d4 + 4 hit points and are cured of all diseases you currently suffer from.

Side Effects:
Depending on the lore your game implements, the holy tonic can have one or more of the following side effects. These effects are hidden from player characters and no magic can reveal them.

	• If you fall unconscious within 1d12 minutes after drinking the holy tonic, you must succeed a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or gain a long-term madness when you regain consciousness.

	• 1 hour after you drink the holy tonic, you hear whispering voices urging you toward violence and chaos. You must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on any Persuasion checks for the next 1d4 hours. Additionally, for the duration, you are compelled to act on aggressive impulses as determined by the GM.

	• 24 hours after you drink the holy tonic, you must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or gain a short-term madness.

	• 24 hours after you drink the holy tonic, you must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or crave more holy tonic. For the next 1d4 hours, you desperately search for a holy tonic and drink the first one you find. If you do not drink one within this time, you gain 1 level of exhaustion and the craving goes away.

	• Each subsequent holy tonic you drink in a 7-day period increases the DCs for the saving throws you must make by 1. Each three holy tonics you drink in a 7day period increases any exhaustion levels the tonic causes by 1.

	• If you fail five Wisdom saving throws caused by a holy tonic within a 7-day period, a curse fully takes hold. You undergo a horrifying transformation into a monstrous beast, losing control of your actions and permanently becoming a beast or monstrosity of the GM's choice under their control.

GM Note: Alternatively the holy tonic can restore 6d4+6 or 8d4+8 hit points.

    <text>Charged Shot: Once on each of your turns you can replace one of your cannon attacks with a charged shot. Instead of a regular attack, you let loose a ball of destruction and death. Each creature in a 120-footlong, 5-foot-wide line in front of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Firearm save DC or take 3d12 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
	You can use this property only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the property, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

Artillery. You must use Strength instead of Dexterity for the Firearm save DC and the attack and damage rolls of this weapon. Such a weapon can be fired once before it must be reloaded with an action.

Booming: The deflagration from firing this weapon makes a stupendous booming sound. The sound can be heard from up to 500 feet away. Firing this weapon makes it impossible to go undetected; you automatically fail Stealth checks to hide until the start of your next turn. In addition, if a creature is within the area of the sound blast, it automatically succeeds on Perception checks against you.

Concussive: These weapons bludgeon as much as they pierce. When determining a creature's resistance or immunity to damage from this weapon, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to piercing or to bludgeoning damage. For instance, if a creature is immune to piercing damage and has no resistance or immunity to bludgeoning damage, it would take full damage from a concussive weapon. Resistance to all physical damage applies as normal.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

	This moongold inlaid cannon deals an extra 1d4 damage to any non-humanoid creatures it hits. Moongold acts as a guiding light in the darknes; creatures holding or wearing moongold have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
	As a bonus action, you can rotate the dials on the cannon to infuse your loaded ammo with violent powers. Your next attack deals magical damage and you can choose one of the following effects.

Forceful Infusion: On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away and knocked prone. Alternatively, if you are standing on a solid surface and instead fire the cannon directly at your feet, the explosion pushes you into the air and you land in a square of your choice within 30 feet of the explosion's origin.

Incendiary Infusion: On a hit, the target takes an extra 3d4 fire damage.

Unstable Infusion: On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d8 cold damage and the terrain in a 10-foot radius centered on the target is covered in arcane mist, becoming difficult terrain for the next minute.

    <text>The guillotine shears are a wonder of mechanical engineering, created to tend to Carmella's garden. Once used to cut excess foliage, it has now been repurposed to sever limbs instead of greenery. This trick weapon was given to hunters as a means of containing the scourge—if they couldn't kill the beasts, they could at least cripple them.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the guillotine is two one-handed weapons—a longsword and a shortsword. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single one-handed weapon-shears. As part of this bonus action, you can do the following:

	• When transforming the swords into shears: you can make a single melee weapon attack with the shears. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative, and you can't use the Guillotine property on this attack.

	• When transforming the shears into swords: you can slide the longsword forward as part of dismounting it, making a single melee weapon attack with it. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you have the Two-Weapon Fighting Style, you can ignore this limitation.

Untransformed: While wielding both swords, the longsword is considered light. The shortsword deals your choice of slashing or piercing damage.

Transformed: The shears are a one-handed martial weapon that deals 1d10 slashing damage on a hit. In addition, it has the Guillotine property.

Guillotine: Immediately after hitting a target with the shears, if you have a free hand, you can use your reaction to pull the lever, snapping the blades together and dealing an extra 1d12 slashing damage to the target. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, you deal an extra 1d12 slashing damage. If this attack deals more than one-quarter of a creature's hit point maximum, you also chop off one the creature's limbs (anything but the head) at the GM's discretion. If this attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is decapitated.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>When the manikin of the Sloered abattoir gained sentience, the Scions sent enforcers to quell this threat to Luyarnha's delicate existence. From the abbatoir's meat hooks and the blunderbusses of the slain enforcers, The Slaughtered-as the manikins named themselves-crafted these versatile weapons. Nicknamed "the meat hook", the hookshot is a trick weapon used by hunters to help close the gap to their prey in a devastating whirl of blades and gunpowder.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the hookshot is two one-handed weapons connected by a short length of chain; a sickle and a blunderbuss. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single two-handed weapon; a blunderbuss with a bladed attachment that can act as a battleaxe.

Untransformed: While untransformed, the sickle has the finesse property, and the blunderbuss doesn't have the two-handed property. Using this pair of weapons together requires the sickle to be held in one hand and the blunderbuss in the other. When you take the Attack action with the sickle, you can make an attack with the blunderbuss as a bonus action, ignoring the barrel property.

Transformed: When you take the Attack action, you can attack with either the blunderbuss or the bladed attachment (which uses the stats of a battleaxe wielded with two hands). In addition, this item gains the Hookshot property.

Hookshot: As an action, you can launch the sickle from the blunderbuss, to which it remains attached by a length of sturdy chain. Make a ranged weapon attack against a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes slashing damage equal to 1d4 plus your Dexterity modifier. If the creature is of your size or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to you. If the creature is of a size larger than yours, you are pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to it. At the end of your turn, the hook detaches from the creature and reattaches itself to the blunderbuss.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>One of the most versatile weapons of the church.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the sanctified partisan is a spear and a shield. In its transformed state, the spear is sheathed by the shield, which retracts into a massive blade; the weapon becomes a glaive.

Untransformed: Using this pair of weapons together requires the spear to be held in one hand and the shield in the other. When you are targeted by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to deflect with the shield, gaining a +2 bonus to AC against that attack. If the attack misses, you can immediately make a single melee weapon attack with the spear as part of the same reaction.

Transformed: This glaive doesn't have the heavy property. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, as part of the attack, you can pierce the target, transform the weapon, and only pull out the spear. The shield remains in the target's body, impaling it. An impaled creature takes 1d4 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns, and its speed is reduced by 15 feet. To remove the shield, the impaled target can use its action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the shield is removed and falls at the target's feet. If you are within 5 feet of the shield, you can use a bonus action to retrieve and don it.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

The stick may only return to its untransformed state over the course of an hour as you use glue and bandages to bind the two pieces back together and wait for it to cure. It has the Ill Advised Weapon property.

Untransformed: It's a stick, has the light property, and if you hit with it, it deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

Transformed: It's two sticks, each held in a hand. A hit with either stick deals 1 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage (minimum of 0).

Ill Advised Weapon: When you attack with the stick, if you roll a 1 on the d20, it is destroyed and unusable. If this occurs during the transformed state of the stick, the stick not used in the attack remains, but cannot be untransformed. If the remaining stick also is destroyed by this property, you no longer have a stick.

    <text>Rather than carrying separate firearms, which often become ineffective when beasts get close, many hunters conceal them within enormous cleavers designed to rend flesh. Such creations of gunpowder and metal are aptly named rifling cleavers.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, it is a large cleaver. In its transformed state, the weapon is a rifle. You can reload the rifle even in its untransformed state.

Untransformed: After making a melee weapon attack with this weapon, you can immediately use your bonus action to make a ranged weapon attack with the rifle against a creature within range that is behind you and in a straight line with you and your first target. This shot extends the weapon, transforming it.

Transformed: Though unwieldy in melee, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the rifle. This attack uses your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The damage die for this attack is a d4, and it deals bludgeoning damage. Your weapon then reverts to its untransformed state.

    <text>Infused with otherworldly ichor, this dark blade is given to warriors of the Abyss Warden, forged from the remains of the monsters they've slain. The elegant and virtuous design of the weapon hides its macabre origins, mirroring the order it came from.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon by sliding the pommel up and down on the blade. In its untransformed state, the abyss warden's axeblade is a longsword. In its transformed state, the weapon becomes a battleaxe. As part of this bonus action, you can slam the weapon down, emitting a wave of radiance centered on you. Each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 radiant damage.
	Both forms of the weapon deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage on a hit. This damage increases to 2d6 for the longsword against Medium or smaller aberrations and to 2d6 for the battleaxe against Large or larger aberrations.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>To gain the benefits of the cordyceps sinensis, you must ingest it, or graft it underneath your skin. For 24 hours, the fungus will incubate within you; during that time, if you swallow liquid flames or light the grafted area ablaze, you will kill the parasite. After 24 hours have passed, the only way to remove the parasite is with a remove curse spell cast at 6th level or higher. If you receive Nawre's Blessing, nothing short of a wish spell will remove the fungus.

While infected with the cordyceps sinensis, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

If you have Nawre's Blessing tattooed or carved onto your body, the parasite becomes a trick weapon for you. You can use your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this magic weapon. In its untransformed state, it is a squashy tendril that emerges from your chest. In its transformed state, the parasite turns both your arms into grotesque elastic appendages of flesh.

Untransformed: The tendril is a simple melee weapon for you that deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit and has the reach property. You can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with the weapon. In addition, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

Transformed: The tendrils infiltrate your arms, turning them into massive clobbering weapons. In this form, you cannot wield any weapon or shield in your hands. These tendrils count as simple melee weapons for you, deal 1d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit, and have the reach property. When you make an attack on your turn, you can choose to do so with both arms at once, treating them as a two-handed weapon that deals 2d8 damage on a hit.

Curse: Evolved Parasite. If you die while infected with the cordyceps sinensis, the parasite gains more control over your body; if you die three times, you become an NPC under the GM's control, and your goals become aligned with that of Nawre. A GM can devise a way for the host to regain control over their body.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the executioner is a scythe and a lantern. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single massive maul.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Untransformed: When you hit a creature with the scythe, as part of the same attack, you can choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach to attack. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to half your initial hit. If you do so, your speed is halved until the end of your turn. In addition, the executioner has the Harvest Property.

Harvest: Whenever a creature of CR 1 or higher (or 1st level or higher) dies within 15 feet of you, the lantern harvests the creature's soul. The soul becomes trapped in the lantern and the creature cannot be resurrected until the soul is freed. As an action, you can free a soul trapped in the lantern. The lantern can hold a maximum of one soul.

Transformed: The maul gains the Soul Explosion property.

Soul Explosion: When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can sacrifice one of the souls held in the lantern to create a massive explosion of ghostflame, permanently destroying the soul. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 radiant damage and 2d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead automatically fail the saving throw.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

    <text>The electric sawblade is a viciously effective tool of war that combines the lethality of silver and electricity. The hilt and guard resemble those of a hunter's longsword, often ornately adorned with the markings of the hunter's faction, symbols of the Radiant Church, or grim skulls that embody the dominion over death of the Scions. From this hilt extends the true terror of the weapon: a broad, straight blade constructed from dozens of razor-sharp, silvered teeth arranged in a looped chain. When wielded, these teeth whirr into a blur of destructive motion, capable of rending flesh, bone, and even the thick hide of beasts with horrifying ease. A powerful generator housed within the hilt infuses the gnashing teeth with crackling energy, adding a galvanizing quality to each cut and rip.

Trick Weapon: This longsword has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to pull the trigger under the blade to transform and infuse it with electricity for 1 minute, until you fall unconscious, or until you use a bonus action to stop the current. This weapon regains 1 charge for each 10 minutes that it spends inside a miniature Galespire Coil (often found inside hunter's workshops).
	This silvered longsword deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage on a hit, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls against creatures not wearing metal armor, as long as the sword has at least 1 charge.

Untransformed: When a melee attack that you can see would hit you, you can use your reaction to parry the attack, adding a bonus to your AC equal to your proficiency bonus against that attack. If this causes the attack to miss you and it was made with a nonmagical weapon, the weapon is destroyed by the teeth of the sawblade.

Transformed: The surge of electricity causes the blade to rev faster, requiring both hands to control it. If you use one hand to attack with this sword while it is transformed, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with it. While transformed, the longsword deals an extra 1d6 slashing and 1d6 lightning damage. In addition, the momentum generated from it propels you. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>A sanctified partisan that was reinforced using gravity magic, typically given to high ranking hunters.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the gravitational partisan is a spear and a shield. In its transformed state, the spear is sheathed by the shield, which retracts into a massive blade; the weapon becomes a glaive.

Untransformed: Using this pair of weapons together requires the spear to be held in one hand and the shield in the other. When you are targeted by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to deflect with the shield, gaining a +4 bonus to AC against that attack. If the attack misses, you can immediately make a single melee weapon attack with the spear as part of the same reaction. On a hit, as part of the attack, you can transform the weapon and a gravity barrier forms in front of you, granting you a +4 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

Transformed: This glaive doesn't have the heavy property. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, as part of the attack, you can pierce the target, transform the weapon, and only pull out the spear. The shield remains in the target's body, impaling it. An impaled creature takes 2d4 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns, and its speed is reduced to 0. To remove the shield, the impaled target can use its action to make a DC 14 Strength check. Medium or smaller creatures have disadvantage on the check. On a success, the shield is removed and falls at the target's feet. If you are within 5 feet of the shield, you can use a bonus action to retrieve and don it.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    <text>When the manikin of the Sloered abattoir gained sentience, the Scions sent enforcers to quell this threat to Luyarnha's delicate existence. From the abbatoir's meat hooks and the blunderbusses of the slain enforcers, The Slaughtered-as the manikins named themselves-crafted these versatile weapons. Nicknamed "the meat hook", the hookshot is a trick weapon used by hunters to help close the gap to their prey in a devastating whirl of blades and gunpowder.

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with both forms of this magic weapon.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the hookshot is two one-handed weapons connected by a short length of chain; a sickle and a blunderbuss. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single two-handed weapon; a blunderbuss with a bladed attachment that can act as a battleaxe.

Untransformed: While untransformed, the sickle has the finesse property, and the blunderbuss doesn't have the two-handed property. Using this pair of weapons together requires the sickle to be held in one hand and the blunderbuss in the other. When you take the Attack action with the sickle, you can make an attack with the blunderbuss as a bonus action, ignoring the barrel property. If you hit a creature with the sickle and the blunderbuss on the same turn, it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws until the end of your next turn.

Transformed: When you take the Attack action, you can attack with either the blunderbuss or the bladed attachment (which uses the stats of a battleaxe wielded with two hands). In addition, this item gains the Hookshot property.

Hookshot: As an action, you can launch the sickle from the blunderbuss, to which it remains attached by a length of sturdy chain. Make a ranged weapon attack against a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes slashing damage equal to 1d4 plus your Dexterity modifier. If the creature is of your size or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to you. If the creature is of a size larger than yours, you are pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to it. At the end of your turn, you can detach the hook from the creature and reattach it to the blunderbuss; if you don't, the creature is grappled by you.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>Rather than carrying separate firearms, which often become ineffective when beasts get close, many hunters conceal them within enormous cleavers designed to rend flesh. Such creations of gunpowder and metal are aptly named rifling cleavers.

You have a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with both forms of this magic weapon.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, it is a large cleaver. In its transformed state, the weapon is a rifle. You can reload the rifle even in its untransformed state.

Untransformed: After making a melee weapon attack with this weapon, you can immediately use your bonus action to make a ranged weapon attack with the rifle against a creature within range that is behind you and in a straight line with you and your first target. This shot extends the weapon, transforming it.

Transformed: This rifle has the Barrel (F) property instead of the Barrel (S) property. Though unwieldy in melee, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the rifle. This attack uses your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The damage die for this attack is a d8, and it deals bludgeoning damage. Your weapon then reverts to its untransformed state.

Ammunition: The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use.

Barrel: The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to the number of bullets its barrel can hold (written as Barrel X) before it must be reloaded according to its fast or slow reload property (F or S, respectively).

	• Fast reload: You must use an attack, an action, or a bonus action to reload this firearm. You must have one free hand to do so.

	• Slow reload: You must use an attack or an action to reload this firearm. You must have one free hand to do so.

Blaring: Firing this weapon makes a thunderous crack. The sound can be heard from up to 100 feet away. Firing a weapon with this property makes it hard to go undetected; you have disadvantage on Stealth checks to hide until the start of your next turn. In addition, if a creature is within the area of the sound blast, it has advantage on Perception checks against you.

    <text>Tarblood is a creation of the Obitus Scholare, an amalgamation of hundreds of species' blood that was forcefully injected to create enhanced hunters. The tarblood could not only be used to push past the apex of mortal power, but could also be used to create weapons-echoing the power of its wielder-when fused with moongold.

This weapon, crafted with moongold, gives you a 1d4 bonus to damage rolls against nonhumanoid creatures. Moongold acts as a guiding light in the darkness; creatures holding or wearing moongold have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

Special Attunement: While you are attuned to this weapon, you know one Blood Shot option of your choice from the Blood Archer Fighter (choose between Bloodboil, Constraining, Shadowblood, or Thunderblood Arrow). You can use this option when you make an attack with this bow. You can use this option twice, and you regain all expended uses daily at dawn. If you are a Blood Archer Fighter, you instead gain 2 additional uses of your Blood Shot feature.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the moongilded tarblood is a longbow. In its transformed state, it's a longsword. By breaking the string, the tarblood melts and flows around the ivory handle, congealing into a longsword; if the sword handle is forcefully shoved into the blade, the weapon reverts into a longbow. Whenever you transform the weapon, the tarblood becomes unstable; your next hit with this weapon reduces the target's speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn as the tar wraps around them, before retreating to the weapon.

Untransformed: The bow can fire regular ammunition, or it can fire lead bullets, the tarblood melting them into arrows.

Transformed: While this weapon is transformed, if you inflict 25 points of damage with it in a single turn against a creature that has blood, and you have no more than one use of your Blood Shot remaining, you regain one use of your Blood Shot.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>This weapon, crafted with moongold, gives you a 1d4 bonus to damage rolls against nonhumanoid creatures.

Moongold acts as a guiding light in the darkness; creatures holding or wearing mongold have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can magically melt the moongold before solidifying it, switching between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the equalizer is a flintlock. In its transformed state, the weapon is an ornate, two-handed weapon; a rifle.

Untransformed: This flintlock has the Barrel 2 (F) property. In addition, being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with this flintlock.

Transformed: When you attack with this weapon, you can choose to replace your attack with a particularly violent shot. Make a ranged weapon attack. On a hit, the target takes the weapon's damage plus an extra 2d8 piercing damage. Hit or miss, this causes the weapon to partially liquefy and turn back into its untransformed state; it can't be transformed again until the end of your next turn.
	You can use this attack only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use this attack, your speed is 0 until the end of your turn.

Ammunition: The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use.

Barrel: The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to the number of bullets its barrel can hold (written as Barrel X) before it must be reloaded according to its fast or slow reload property (F or S, respectively).

	• Fast reload: You must use an attack, an action, or a bonus action to reload this firearm. You must have one free hand to do so.

	• Slow reload: You must use an attack or an action to reload this firearm. You must have one free hand to do so.

Blaring: Firing this weapon makes a thunderous crack. The sound can be heard from up to 100 feet away. Firing a weapon with this property makes it hard to go undetected; you have disadvantage on Stealth checks to hide until the start of your next turn. In addition, if a creature is within the area of the sound blast, it has advantage on Perception checks against you.

Dark and metallic, the crevices of a phantom limb glow with a wan, cold light when fused with the warm body of its wielder.

Attunement: When you attune to this item, the cold, lifeless hand merges with your flesh and either replaces a missing arm or consumes one of your existing arms (your choice when you attune to this weapon). An arm consumed in this way does not reappear when you unattune from the item.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the phantom limb is a metallic, articulating hand. In its transformed state, the weapon is a shortsword.

Untransformed: Unarmed strikes you make with the phantom limb deal magical bludgeoning damage. In addition, the limb reacts to deflect incoming blows, granting you a +1 bonus to AC.

Transformed: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this shortsword, which gains the Haunting Mark property.

Haunting Mark: Whenever you hit an undead creature with an attack using this blade then, for the next minute, you can see its form as a glowing outline, even if it is invisible, and you always know the direction and distance to the creature while it is on the same plane as you. This effect ends early if you hit a different undead creature with an attack using this blade, or if the phantom limb is no longer in its transformed state.

Losing limbs is not enough to keep a hunter down; in that sense, they are more tenacious than the very beasts they hunt.

In its transformed state, the gazer is a glaive which can be used as a spellcasting focus. To transform this weapon, you must feed it your blood: each time you shift this weapon into its transformed state, or start your turn with the glaive in its transformed state, you take 1d4 necrotic damage, which cannot be reduced in any way. This damage cannot break your concentration.

Transformed: While the glaive is in its transformed state, it grants you a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls, increases your spell save DC by 1, and gives you truesight out to 30 feet.

You have a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with both forms of this weapon.

Attunement: When you attune to this weapon, the cold, lifeless snake wraps around your forearm and bites your flesh, burying its head beneath it and inflicting 1d4 piercing damage. While attuned, you cannot be disarmed of this magical weapon. Ending the attunement causes the head to retract and the item to fall to the ground.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the bladewhip is a metallic whip. In its transformed state, the weapon solidifies by coagulating your blood to form a rapier.

Untransformed: Attacks you make with the serpent bladewhip add an additional 5 feet to your reach, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it. In addition, if you hit a creature twice in a turn with this weapon, the whip's devouring hunger awakens and tears out more of its flesh, dealing an extra 2d4 slashing damage.

Transformed: While transformed, you take 1 piercing damage at the start of each of your turns as the blade drains your blood to empower itself. This rapier gains the Fireblood Poison property and is considered silvered.

Fireblood Poison: Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack using this blade, you can coat the wound with poison and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is poisoned for the next minute as its innards start to boil. This can affect creatures immune to the poisoned condition. While poisoned in this way, the creature takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. This damage ignores resistance to fire damage.
	A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the blade's Fireblood Poison for the next 24 hours.

    <text>While attuned to this weapon, you have resistance to lightning damage.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, if you've taken lightning damage or spent a hit die since the start of your last turn, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the claw is a sinewy leather gauntlet, made from the muscle and hide of a galvanized prowler. In its transformed state, the claw surges with electrical energy, merging with its wearer's forearm and turning into a monstrous claw.

Untransformed: The bestial hide feeds off of you in exchange for power; you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, this gauntlet devours your life force. When you hit with a melee attack, you can spend a hit die to deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage.

The gauntlet has 2 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you take lighting or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge to instead take no damage and regain 1 hit die.

Transformed: The gauntlet merges with your form, turning your hand into an aberrant claw that you cannot be disarmed of. This claw changes the damage of your unarmed strikes to 1d8, the damage type to slashing, and you can use your Dexterity or Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls made with it.
	In addition, when you hit with a melee attack using this claw, you can spend a hit die to deal an extra 1d8 lightning damage.
	The claw is too unwieldy to use for delicate handling, such as activating intricate mechanisms (like the trigger of a firearm) or picking locks with thieves' tools.

The uncharged claw can be turned into a galvanized claw by crushing the live heart of a galvanized prowler with it.

    <text>While holding this weapon, your attacks and spells deal double damage to structures, and fire damage you take is reduced by an amount equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the crumbler is a roaring cannon with smoke coming out of its mouth. In its transformed state, the handle extends, turning the cannon into a highly unstable and destructive maul. As part of this bonus action, you can do the following:

	• When transforming the cannon into a maul, you can shoot at your feet, even if the cannon isn't loaded, using the deflagration to propel yourself and jump up to 30 feet in any direction. This jump doesn't cost you any movement.

	• When transforming the maul into a cannon, you can reload the cannon and retain its unstable force. If you load it in this way, the next time you hit with an attack with the cannon attack on your turn, it will push you back 30 feet in a straight line.

Untransformed: The unstable crumbler heats up cannonballs, transforming them into infernal ammunition. Whenever you roll a 15 or higher on the d20 when making an attack roll with this weapon, the cannonball becomes overheated and explodes on impact. When the cannonball explodes in this way, it is considered an explosive cannonball.

Transformed: Whenever you roll a 18 or higher on the d20 while making an attack roll with this weapon, the maul's head detonates, causing an effect that acts as the fireball spell (DC 15) centered on the target. If you succeed on this saving throw, you take no damage.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

As part of this bonus action, you can slam the weapon down, emitting a wave of radiance centered on you. Each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 radiant damage.

Both forms of the weapon deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage on a hit. This damage increases to 2d6 for the longsword against Medium or smaller aberrations and to 2d6 for the battleaxe against Large or larger aberrations.

Untransformed: When you hit a creature with an attack using this longsword, you can cause another creature of your choice within 5 feet of it to take radiant damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 1).

Transformed: When you hit a creature with an attack using this battleaxe, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls made against creatures other than you until the end of its next turn.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>The Caldera is an intimidating weapon. In its battleaxe form, it is crowned with a black-hole-like orb that bubbles menacingly with molten metal. This churning crucible holds the devastating axe together and serves as a searing ammunition barrel in the weapon's pistol form.

When you attune to the Caldera, the metallic crucible at its apex ignites, constantly simmering with superheated lead. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. Each time you transform the weapon, you take 1d4 fire damage as the liquid-fire reservoir that serves as a material catalyst surges with thermal energy. In its untransformed state, the Caldera is a battleaxe that can devour its haft to reform into a pair of pistols, each holding half of the crucible. In its transformed state, the weapon is two pistols that can be slammed together to reform the crucible, alongside the rest of the battleaxe.
	When you transform this weapon into pistols, the crucible refills each of the barrels with 6 lead bullets (12 total), filling up one pistol fully, then the other. When you switch to the untransformed state of the weapon, any unfired lead bullets are re-added to the boiling metal. The boiling metal can contain up to 60 lead bullets, and the weapon can't transform unless it contains at least 7 lead bullets. As an action, you can feed the crucible in either state by throwing lead bullets in it or by adding a cannonball, which counts as 30 bullets.

Untransformed: When you hit with this battleaxe, you can expend 3 lead bullets from the boiling metal to cover the target in molten lead. The target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage, and it takes that damage again at the start of each of its turns unless it rolls on the floor (prone) or uses a bonus action to wipe off the lead.

Transformed: You pull out two fiery pistols from the molten metal. When you attack with them, you can use your Strength modifier, instead of Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. These pistols are each loaded to full capacity, if there are enough lead bullets in the boiling metal.
	When you use the Fan Fire property of these pistols, the cumulative penalty per bullet fired is -2 instead of -
3, and the pistol deals fire damage instead of piercing damage. In addition, if you roll a 1, the gun doesn't jam, and you instead take 1d6 fire damage.

Bullet Hell: As an action, if both pistols are fully loaded, you can fire both of them in rapid succession, emptying all 12 bullets. Make 6 ranged attacks with the pistols, each dealing 1d6 piercing damage and 1d6 fire damage on a hit. Each attack after the first suffers a cumulative -2 penalty to the attack roll. You cannot add any modifier to the damage roll of these attacks beyond the first-such as the bonus from your Dexterity modifier or the Sharp-Shooter feat-apart from this weapon's bonus to damage rolls. The weapon then reverts to its untransformed state.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>This sword, formed of coagulated blood, is a dark red, nearly black color. It is warm to the touch and emits a vigorous pulse. According to legend, the blade has a will of its own and grows stronger by consuming the blood of its victims. The sword may even make its master immortal, but at a heavy cost.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage on a hit.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the blade is a vile longsword glowing with echoes of blood. In its transformed state, the weapon is a greatsword with an even more nefarious aspect.

To transform this weapon, you must feed it blood. Each time you deal damage with this weapon to a creature that possesses blood, the épée gains 1 charge. The épée can hold up to 4 charges. Each charge lasts for 1 minute or until it is consumed. If this weapon has 1 or more charges, you can use your bonus action to transform it.

Untransformed: You gain a 1d4 bonus to attack rolls you make with this weapon against creatures that have more than half their hit points.

Transformed: You gain a 1d4 bonus to attack rolls you make with this weapon against creatures that are bloodied (half of its hit points or fewer). In this form, the épée sanguine consumes 1 charge at the end of each of your turns, unless you've expended 1 or more charges that turn. It reverts back to its untransformed state if it loses all charges.

When you hit a creature with an attack using the épée, you can expend 1 or more charges to unleash the blood accumulated in the blade:

	• 1 Charge. You heal a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage you dealt.

	• 2 Charges. You deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage and heal a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage you dealt.

	• 3 Charges. The target becomes bound in blood and must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d6 necrotic damage and is restrained until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't restrained.

	• 4 Charges. Blood covers the creature's face and chokes it. The creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d 10 necrotic damage and is stunned until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't stunned.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

The weapon's blade emits bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can summon or extinguish the light at will (no action required). This weapon has the Deflective Light property.

Deflective Light: When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to cause a burst of sunlight to flare before the attacker, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll and transforming the weapon. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this property. This property can be used three times, regaining all expended uses daily at dawn.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the blade is a metallic greatsword glowing with light. In its transformed state, the weapon is two shortswords emitting the same glow.

Untransformed: While wielding this greatsword, your reflexes are enhanced. You gain a +1 bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.

Transformed: When you engage in two-weapon fighting with these shortswords, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. In addition, this weapon gains the Brightburn property.

Brightburn: Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature two times with these shortswords, the accumulated solar energy singes them. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Proficiency: martial, longsword, great sword

    <text>This weapon, crafted with moongold, gives you a 1d4 bonus to damage rolls against nonhumanoid creatures.

Moongold acts as a guiding light in the darkness; creatures holding or wearing moongold have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness.

Attunement: This weapon has 5 charges and regains them daily at midnight. While attuned to this weapon, you can expend a charge to turn ephemeral, granting you the ability to walk through objects and creatures as if they were difficult terrain until the end of your turn. If you end your turn inside an object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can magically melt the moongold before solidifying it, switching between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the equalizer is a flintlock. In its transformed state, the weapon is an ornate, two-handed weapon; a rifle.

Untransformed: This flintlock has the Barrel 2 (F) property. In addition, being within 5 feet of a hostile creature or targeting a prone creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with this flintlock.

Transformed: When you attack with this weapon, you can choose to replace your attack with a particularly violent shot. Make a ranged weapon attack and expend up to 5 charges. On a hit, the target takes the weapon's damage plus an extra 2d8 piercing damage + an extra 1d8 radiant damage for each charge expended. If you expended more than 2 charges for the attack, the target is also blinded until the end of its next turn. Hit or miss, this causes the weapon to partially liquefy and turn back into its untransformed state; it can't be transformed again until the end of your next turn.

You can use this attack only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use this attack, your speed is 0 until the end of your turn.

Ammunition: The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use.

Barrel: The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to the number of bullets its barrel can hold (written as Barrel X) before it must be reloaded according to its fast or slow reload property (F or S, respectively).

	• Fast reload: You must use an attack, an action, or a bonus action to reload this firearm. You must have one free hand to do so.

	• Slow reload: You must use an attack or an action to reload this firearm. You must have one free hand to do so.

Blaring: Firing this weapon makes a thunderous crack. The sound can be heard from up to 100 feet away. Firing a weapon with this property makes it hard to go undetected; you have disadvantage on Stealth checks to hide until the start of your next turn. In addition, if a creature is within the area of the sound blast, it has advantage on Perception checks against you.

    <text>The Faux Lunaire is a weapon of mystery and celestial majesty, echoing the moon in its transformations. The creators of this weapon are the lunar wardens, who have to fight creatures that are far beyond mere beasts.

If you cast the light cantrip targeting this weapon, the carved runes activate. For the duration of the spell, as long as you hold the weapon, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, and you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet.

Trick weapon: The Faux Lunaire is a wickedly curved scythe crafted from an arcane alloy and engraved with lunar imagery and celestial runes. With a swift, spinning motion, the limbs of the blade and shaft of the scythe fold in and rotate around the grip, locking into place to form an ornate longbow. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. As part of the bonus action, you can also magically teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. In its untransformed state, this weapon is a scythe. In its transformed state, it's a longbow.

Untransformed: Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this weapon, you can force it to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, becoming affected by the faerie fire spell on a failure. You do not need to concentrate on this spell, but it ends early if you put another creature under the effect of the spell, or if you fall unconscious.

Transformed: In its transformed state, the Faux Lunaire has 2 charges. When you attack a creature with this bow, you can expend 1 charge to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17) from it (no action required): moonbeam or darkness. The spell is centered on the creature's space and lasts until the end of your next turn. You do not need to concentrate on it, and you can only have one of these spells active at a time. If your attack misses, you expend the charge but the effect fails. The Faux Lunaire regains 1 expended charge each time it is targeted by the light cantrip.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>Ripping the flesh of the beasts they slay to fashion ferocious weapons is something hunters have gotten remarkably good at over the course of their hunts.

While attuned to this weapon, you have resistance to lightning and thunder damage.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the claw is a sinewy leather gauntlet, made from the muscle and hide of a galvanized prowler. In its transformed state, the claw surges with electrical energy, merging with its wearer's forearm and turning into a monstrous claw.

Untransformed: The bestial hide invigorates you, giving you the lightning fast reflexes of the galvanized prowler slaughtered to make this gauntlet; you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, this gauntlet feeds off of your power. If you have temporary hit points when you hit with a melee attack, you deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage.
	The gauntlet has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you take lighting or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge to instead take no damage and gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you would have taken.

Transformed: The gauntlet merges with your form, turning your hand into an aberrant claw that you cannot be disarmed of. This claw changes the damage of your unarmed strikes to 1d8, the damage type to slashing, and you can use your Dexterity or Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls made with it. Further, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
	When you use the Attack action with this claw, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action. In addition, if you have temporary hit points, when you hit with a melee attack using this claw, you deal an extra 1d8 lightning damage.
	The claw is too unwieldy to use for delicate handling, such as activating intricate mechanisms (like the trigger of a firearm) or picking locks with thieves tools.

    <text>You have a +2 to attack and damage rolls made with both forms of this weapon.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the guillotine is two one-handed weapons—a longsword and a shortsword. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single one-handed weapon-shears. As part of this bonus action, you can do the following:

	• When transforming the swords into shears: you can make a single melee weapon attack with the shears. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative, and you can't use the Guillotine property on this attack.

	• When transforming the shears into swords: you can slide the longsword forward as part of dismounting it, making a single melee weapon attack with it. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you have the Two-Weapon Fighting Style, you can ignore this limitation.

Untransformed: While wielding both swords, the longsword is considered light. The shortsword deals your choice of slashing or piercing damage. Whenever you damage a creature with both swords on the same turn, it takes extra slashing damage equal to your choice of either your Strength or Dexterity modifier (minimum of 1).

Transformed: The shears are a one-handed martial weapon that deals 1d12 slashing damage on a hit and scores a critical hit on a 19 or 20. In addition, it has the Guillotine property.

Guillotine: Immediately after hitting a target with the shears, if you have a free hand, you can use your reaction to pull the lever, snapping the blades together and dealing an extra 1d12 slashing damage to the target. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, you deal an extra 3d12 slashing damage. If this attack deals more than one quarter of a creature's hit point maximum, you also chop off one the creature's limbs (anything but the head) at the GM's discretion. If this attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is decapitated

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the phantom limb is a metallic, articulating hand. In its transformed state, the weapon is a shortsword.

Untransformed: Unarmed strikes you make with the phantom limb deal magical bludgeoning damage. If a creature damaged by your unarmed strikes has an ability that would allow it to walk through objects and creatures (such as a ghost's incorporeal movement), it loses that ability until the start of your next turn. In addition, the limb reacts to deflect incoming blows, granting you a +2 bonus to AC.

Transformed: You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this shortsword, which gains the Haunting Mark property. While the weapon is in this form, you can't be possessed.

Haunting Mark: Whenever you hit an undead creature with an attack using this blade then, for the next minute, you can see its form as a glowing outline, even if it is invisible, and you always know the direction and distance to the creature while it is on the same plane as you. This effect ends early if you hit a different undead creature with an attack using this blade, or if the phantom limb is no longer in its transformed state.

Losing limbs is not enough to keep a hunter down; in that sense, they are more tenacious than the very beasts they hunt.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the gazer is a glaive. In its transformed state, the gazer is a glaive which can be used as a spellcasting focus.

To transform this weapon, you must feed it your blood: each time you shift this weapon into its transformed state, or start your turn with the glaive in its transformed state, you take 1d4 necrotic damage, which cannot be reduced in any way. This damage cannot break your concentration.

Untransformed: While the glaive is in its untransformed state, you can use your spellcasting ability modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making attack rolls using the glaive.

Transformed: While the glaive is in its transformed state, it grants you a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls, increases your spell save DC by 1, and gives you truesight out to 30 feet. Further, while you aren't incapacitated, you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see.

The ravenous gazer can be turned into its improved version by feeding it enough blood from aberrations.

    <text>Head and spine severed from a Cloistered Maiden, the first wielder of this accursed weapon was considered insane, even amongst madmen-after all, the difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits. To control the osteosymbiosis, one must fuse their arm to the bony corpse of an abomination of nature and pray that the gods won't punish this crime against creation.

Attunement: When you attune to this item, the warm, still moving spine merges with the bones in your arm and replaces them. Bones consumed in this way do not reappear when you unattune from the item.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it has the Bone Explosion property.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the osteosymbiosis is embedded in your flesh, with spikes protruding from your knuckles, changing your unarmed strikes. In its transformed state, it generates a weapon made of bones. When it transforms, roll a d8 to determine the weapon's type, according to the table below. You are proficient with all the forms of this weapon.

Untransformed: Your unarmed attacks deal an extra 1d8 piercing damage. Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with an unarmed strike, you can rupture the bone spikes that grow from your hands, leaving them embedded in your prey. You deal an extra 1d4 piercing damage to your target and it gains 1 bone shard. Your bone protrusions regrow immediately.

Transformed: Your attacks with this weapon deal an extra 1d4 slashing damage and score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20. Further, the osseous nature of this armament renders it frail. If you score a critical hit against a creature, the weapon breaks upon the target's flesh, dealing an extra 4d4 piercing damage, and the target gains 4 bone shards. The weapon then reverts to its untransformed state.

Bone Explosion: As a bonus action, you can detonate all the bone shards embedded in one of your prey. If the target is dead, the shards fail to detonate. Each creature other than you within 15 feet of the target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 1d4 piercing damage for each bone shard that detonated. On a success, it takes half as much damage. The bone shards shatter into dust and disappear. A creature with more than 2 bone shards embedded in its body has disadvantage on this saving throw.

Maiden's Curse: While attuned to this weapon, when a Blood Moon of Rebirth rises, the maiden's curse awakens and spreads to its owner. You must make a Wisdom saving throw against the Madness DC of the moon. If your character has a womb—or has ever had a womb in their body—on a failure, the weapon merges with you completely and you turn into a Cloistered Maiden under the GM's control. If you never had a womb, on a failure, instead of transforming, you die.

Engaging in a symbiotic rapport with the sanctified metal that surrounds it, the noxious bloom possesses near-flawless regenerative abilities. Moreover, the flowers exude a cloying fragrance, simultaneously repelling ravenous beasts and the cold touch of death. When set alight, the Orphan's Tear can serve as a very durable fuel, only to restore itself in a cycle of rebirth once the flames have been extinguished. Some say that this very capacity to elude the grasp of death is the force that set Carmella upon her unique destiny."

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In both states, the weapon is a morningstar with the reach property.

Untransformed: The flowers growing in the cradle exude a sickly sweet scent that calms the mind of men and chases away nightmares. Humanoids within 10 feet of the cradle have advantage on saving throws against the charmed and frightened condition. In addition, the cradle has the Vile Miasma and Cleansing Miasma properties.

Vile Miasma: When you hit a beast or an undead with orphans cradle, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute, even if the target is immune to the poisoned condition. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Vile Miasma for the next 24 hours.

Cleansing Miasma: As an action, you can cleanse one humanoid you can see within 10 feet of you. It gains 1d12 temporary hit points and can end one of the following conditions: charmed, frightened, or poisoned. Once a creature has benefited from this property, it can't benefit from it again for 1 hour.

Transformed: When transformed, the cradle's plants ignite, and it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage on a hit. In addition, the weapon gains the Fanned Flames and Withering Flames properties.

Fanned Flames: As an action you can rotate the cradle wildly around you, fanning the flames. Each creature in a 20-foot cone in front of you must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Beasts and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. After using this property, orphan's cradle reverts to its untransformed state and can't be transformed again for 1d4-1 rounds.

Withering Flames: When you hit a beast or an undead with orphan's cradle, you can force the target to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target becomes vulnerable to your choice of one of the following damage types until the start of its next turn: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or radiant. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the cradle's Withering Flames for the next 24 hours.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the executioner is a scythe and a lantern. In its transformed state, this weapon is a single massive maul.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Untransformed: When you hit a creature with the scythe, as part of the same attack, you can choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach to attack. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your initial hit. If you do so, your speed is halved until the end of your turn. In addition, the executioner has the Harvest property.

Harvest: Whenever a creature of CR 1 or higher (or 1st level or higher) dies within 15 feet of you, the lantern harvests the creature's soul. The soul becomes trapped in the lantern and the creature cannot be resurrected until the soul is freed. As an action, you can free a soul trapped in the lantern. The lantern can hold a maximum of three souls.

Transformed: The maul gains the Soul Explosion and Undying Light properties.

Soul Explosion: When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can sacrifice one of the souls held in the lantern to create a massive explosion of ghostflame, permanently destroying the soul. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 radiant damage and 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead automatically fail the saving throw.

Undying Light: If the lantern is holding at least one soul, the maul sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. Each creature of your choice that enters the bright light for the first time on a turn or start its turn there must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you until the start of its next turn. Undead automatically fail the saving throw.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Proficiency: martial, maul

    <text>Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the executioner is a scythe and a lantern. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single massive maul.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Untransformed: When you hit a creature with the scythe, as part of the same attack, you can choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach to attack. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to half your initial hit. If you do so, your speed is halved until the end of your turn. In addition, the executioner has the Harvest Property.

Harvest: Whenever a creature of CR 1 or higher (or 1st level or higher) dies within 15 feet of you, the lantern harvests the creature's soul. The soul becomes trapped in the lantern and the creature cannot be resurrected until the soul is freed. As an action, you can free a soul trapped in the lantern. The lantern can hold a maximum of one soul.

Transformed: The maul gains the Soul Explosion property.

Soul Explosion: When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can sacrifice one of the souls held in the lantern to create a massive explosion of ghostflame, permanently destroying the soul. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 radiant damage and 2d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead automatically fail the saving throw.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>Made of an unknown metal that mixes blood and steel, this ghastly sword is studded with dozens of eyes from various creatures that stare hungrily at all who are confronted with it. Only a competent hunter can wield a weapon of such weight, but armed with it, they will never lose sight of their prey and will never be caught in an ambush. Such a dangerous weapon should only be used with the utmost caution.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While attuned to it, your sight improves as your vision starts echoing with that of the blade. While holding revelations, you gain the following benefits:

	• You can't be surprised

	• Other creatures don't gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being unseen by you.

	• You are immune to being blinded, as the sword absorbs the effect and closes two of its eyes instead, before regrowing them.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the weapon is a cleaver studded with eyeballs. In its transformed state, the weapon is a whip composed of metal shards held together by a sinew of blood and flesh.

Untransformed: When you hit a creature with this cleaver, you curse them for the next hour. For the duration, you gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls made with the weapon against the target, any attack roll you make with the weapon against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20, and you have advantage on any Perception or Survival check you make to find the target. The curse ends early if you transform the weapon or if you fall unconscious.

Transformed: This whip deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit, has the versatile (1d6/1d8) property, but does not have the finesse property. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can attempt to crush them under the weight of the whip.

The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or take 1d6 slashing damage and be knocked prone.

Curse: Devour Sight. While attuned to this weapon, your sight deteriorates rapidly. For each five days that pass, you gain a permanent -1 penalty to all Perception checks made using your sight. When this penalty reaches -5, your eyes rot and melt out, leaving you permanently blinded as two new eyes appear on the blade.
	The sword's curse is insidious: while you remain attuned to the weapon, you do not suffer the penalty to your Perception checks, and you do not realize that your sight is worsening. The blade's influence makes you perceive the world in a clearer light. Demidritches are immune to this curse.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

	• You have truesight out to 30 feet.

Untransformed: When you hit a creature with this cleaver, you curse them for the next hour. For the duration, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls made with the weapon against the target, any attack roll you make with the weapon against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19, or 20 on the d20, and you have advantage on any Perception or Survival check you make to find the target. The curse ends early if you transform the weapon or if you fall unconscious.

Transformed: This whip deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit, has the versatile (1d6/1d8) property, but does not have the finesse property. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can attempt to crush them under the weight of the whip. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC =
8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier)
or take 3d6 slashing damage and be knocked prone and restrained.

Curse: All Devouring Sight. While attuned to this weapon, your sight deteriorates rapidly. For each five days that pass, you gain a permanent -1 penalty to all Perception checks made using your sight. When this penalty reaches -5, your eyes rot and melt out, leaving you permanently blinded as two new eyes appear on the blade. However when you kill a creature of a CR equal to your level or greater, if the creature had eyes, your curse's penalty regresses by 1 (e.g.,
from -2 penalty to -1) to a minimum of 0.
	The sword's curse is insidious: while you remain attuned to the weapon, you do not suffer the penalty to your Perception checks, and you do not realize that your sight is worsening. The blade's influence makes you perceive the world in a clearer light. Demidritches are immune to this curse.

    <text>You have a +2 to attack and damage rolls made with both forms of this weapon.

Attunement: When you attune to this weapon, the cold, lifeless snake wraps around your forearm and bites your flesh, burying its head beneath it and inflicting 1d4 piercing damage. While attuned, you cannot be disarmed of this magical weapon. Ending the attunement causes the head to retract and the item to fall to the ground.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the bladewhip is a metallic whip. In its transformed state, the weapon solidifies by coagulating your blood to form a rapier.

Untransformed: Attacks you make with the python bladewhip add an additional 5 feet to your reach, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it. In addition, if you hit a creature twice in a turn with this weapon, the whip's devouring hunger awakens and tears out more of its flesh, dealing an extra 4d4 slashing damage, and at the start of the target's next turn, it takes an extra 2d4 slashing damage.

Transformed: While transformed, you take 1 piercing damage at the start of each of your turns as the blade drains your blood to empower itself. In addition, you gain immunity to the poisoned condition and to curses from spells (such as from bestow curse). This rapier gains the Fireblood Poison property and is considered silvered.

Fireblood Poison: Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack using this blade, you can coat the wound with poison and the target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is poisoned for the next minute as its innards start to boil. This can affect creatures immune to the poisoned condition. While poisoned in this way, the creature takes 3d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. This damage ignores resistance to fire damage.
	A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the blade's Fireblood Poison for the next 24 hours.

    <text>This weapon is the flesh of a Great One carved away in pain and fashioned into a blade. The Shard of Moonlight is the reason the Shattered Moon exists and the Devouring Moon is no more. He who wields the blade is overwhelmed by hope, however misguided it might be...

While attuned to this weapon, you gain the following benefits:

	• You are proficient with greatswords and longswords.

	• You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and the blade deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage on a hit.

	• You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, except those made to resist madness.

	• You can use this shard as a spellcasting focus.

Sentience: The Shard of Moonlight is a sentient weapon, with the same personality as the Great One whose flesh it was carved from. The weapon sporadically communicates telepathically with its wielder through images and sounds, though it doesn't speak.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the blade is a metallic longsword that absorbs light. In its transformed state, the weapon is a greatsword that pulses with lunar energy. In both states, this weapon has the light property.

Untransformed: The blade seems to guide your strikes. Once on each of your turns when you make an attack with the shard, you can immediately make a second attack (no action required). It has the Void Absorption property.

Void Absorption: The void that fills the blade is capable of absorbing magic. While holding the untransformed shard, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting you, including spells with an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy—not the spell itselfis stored in the shard in the form of charges. The number of charges gained is equivalent to the level of the spell when it was cast (minimum of 1 for cantrips). The shard can absorb and store up to 10 charges. If the shard doesn't have enough empty charges for a spell, it fails to absorb it. The blade regains all charges each time the moon changes.

Transformed: To transform this blade, you must use a bonus action while under direct moonlight. The transformation lasts for 1 minute, or until you end it early as a bonus action. When it transforms, you can expend the charges stored within the blade, and when the blade loses all charges, the transformation ends. While the blade is transformed, the extra radiant damage it deals on a hit increases from 1d6 to 2d6.

Each time you make an attack in the transformed state, you can expend a number of charges to create special effects:

	• Revealing Glow: As part of making an attack, you can expend 1 charge to empower the shard. On a hit, it deals an extra 1d12 radiant damage, and until the start of your next turn, the target sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. While affected by the light, attack rolls against the target have advantage if the attacker can see them, and the affected target can't turn invisible.

	• Transient Moonlight: As part of making an attack, you can expend 2 charges to release a wave of moonlight where the shard slashes, creating a 5-foot-wide, 60-footlong line of moonlight in front of you. A creature in the path of the moonlight must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d12 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	• Lunar Explosion: Instead of making an attack, you can expend 3 charges to raise the shard upward and release a burst of moonlight energy. Each creature within 30 feet of you must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d12 radiant damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage and isn't knocked prone on a successful one. If a creature falls prone within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to immediately make a melee weapon attack against them with the shard.

    <text>The Sword of the Radiant Watcher is an ancient weapon, meant to contain two entities bound into eternal hatred. One was a hunter and one was a beast, though no one knows which aspect of the blade they were bound to.

Sentience: This sentient weapon has two distinct personalities, each linked to its corresponding transformed state. The Angelic personality (alignment: lawful good) is protective and nurturing, while the Hateful personality (alignment: chaotic evil) is cunning and ruthless. The weapon has an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 17. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The dominant personality may attempt to influence the wielder's actions, particularly when it comes to matters of morality or strategy. However, the sword cannot force its wielder to act against their will. The sword communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Deep Speech.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon by letting hatred or hope overwhelm you. In both states, the weapon is a longsword. When the weapon's form changes, so too does its dominant personality.
	The two personalities within the Sword of the Radiant Watcher are in constant struggle for dominance. When the wielder attempts to switch the weapon's forms, they must exert their force of will to do so, making a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a success, the sword changes form, and on a failure, it stubbornly refuses to do so until the start of your next turn, at which point you can attempt to switch the weapon's forms again.

Untransformed: Light Form. The Angelic personality is dominant and the sword deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit.

Curse of Light: When you hit a creature with this sword, you can bind the target to your light (no action required). For the next minute, you are under the effect of the sanctuary spell, but only the bound target must make the saving throw. This effect ends as normal if you take an action that would break it but returns at the start of your next turn.

Retribution of Light: When a target is under the effect of the Curse of Light, as a bonus action, you can bolster up to four creatures of your choice that can hear you within 30 feet for the duration of the curse. While bolstered, they have advantage on their first attack roll against the target each turn, and if the attack hits, it deals extra damage equal to their proficiency bonus of the damage type they dealt. This property of the weapon can be used three times, regaining all expended uses daily at dawn.

Transformed: Shadow Form. The Hateful personality is dominant and the sword deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage on a hit.

Shadow Chain: When you hit a creature with this sword, you can tether the target to you with a chain of shadowy energy (no action required). While tethered, the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet, and neither you nor the creature can willingly move or teleport more than 30 feet away from each other. The tether lasts for 1 minute, until you use this property on another creature, if you start your turn more than 30 feet away from the target, or end the tether as a bonus action.

Shadow Consumption: While tethered to a creature with your Shadow Chain, once on each of your turns when you hit the target with this weapon, you can inflict an extra 3d6 necrotic damage and gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. This property of the weapon can be used three times, regaining all expended uses daily at dawn.

Abhorrent Existence: The sentient entities within the sword are antithetical to each other, and no creature can withstand their presence at once, which is why the blade was sealed in such a way. Once on each of your turns, if both forms of the sword damage the same creature in a single turn, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or gain a short-term madness.
	In addition, if you deal necrotic damage with the shadow form of sword while the Curse of Light is in effect; or oppositely, if you deal radiant damage with the light form of the sword while the Shadow Chain is in effect, the effect ends and detonates. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage and 2d6 necrotic damage as the antithetical energies resonate and self-destruct. You have advantage on this saving throw.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>While attuned to this weapon, you gain the following benefits:

	• You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage on a hit. When you hit a creature with blood with this weapon, the target takes an extra 1d8 necrotic damage.

	• You are immune to poison and necrotic damage and the poisoned condition.

	• You know the exact location of any creature with blood within a 30-foot radius, even if they are invisible or on the Ethereal plane.

The weapon has the Lifestealing property.

Lifestealing: In dire situations, the epée grants you the power to take the life of others. If you are reduced to one-quarter of your hit points or fewer, you can immediately use this property (no action required). Until the end of your next turn, whenever you deal damage using this weapon, you regain hit points equal to the damage dealt. Once this property of the weapon has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the blade is a vile longsword glowing with echoes of blood. In its transformed state, the weapon is a greatsword with an even more nefarious aspect.
	To transform this weapon, you must feed it blood. Each time you deal damage with this weapon to a creature that possesses blood, the épée gains 1 charge. The épée can hold up to 6 charges. Each charge lasts for 1 minute or until it is consumed. If this weapon has 1 or more charges, you can use your bonus action to transform it.

Untransformed: You gain a 1d12 bonus to attack rolls you make with this weapon against creatures that are at their hit point maximum. In addition, the weapon has the Blood Shield property.

Blood Shield: The épée forms a barrier of blood around you with the blood it has absorbed. You gain a + 1 bonus to AC for each 2 charges within the épée.

Transformed: You gain a 1d6 bonus to attack rolls you make with this weapon against creatures that are below their hit point maximum. In this form, the épée sanguine consumes 1 charge at the end of each of your turns, unless you've expended 1 or more charges that turn. It reverts back to its untransformed state if it loses all charges.

When you hit a creature with an attack using the épée, you can expend 1 or more charges to unleash the blood accumulated in the blade:

	• 1 Charge. You heal a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage you dealt.

	• 2 Charges. You deal an extra 2d8 necrotic damage and heal a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage you dealt.

	• 3 Charges. The target becomes bound in blood and must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 4d6 necrotic damage and is restrained until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't restrained.

	• 4 Charges. Blood covers the creature's face and chokes it. The creature must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 4d10 necrotic damage and is stunned until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't stunned.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>The method to create the Épée Solaire is a tight-lipped secret, involving harnessing the power of the sun, a method that only devout followers of the Radiant One can grasp. As time went on, the sun faded from the skies of Luyarnha, replaced by a never ending night, and so, the creation of this weapon became impossible. This Epée Solaire was bathed in the blood of the sun, unleashing its potential.

While attuned to this weapon, you gain the following benefits:

	• You are proficient with greatswords and shortswords.

	• You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit. When you hit an aberration or undead with it, the extra radiant damage increases to 2d8.

	• You have advantage on saving throws against madness.

The weapon's blade emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight. You can summon or extinguish the light at will (no action required). Each creature of your choice in the light has resistance to radiant damage. This weapon has the Deflective Light property.

Deflective Light: When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to cause a burst of sunlight to flare before the attacker, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll and transforming the weapon. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this property.

Trick Weapon: As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the blade is a metallic greatsword glowing with light. In its transformed state, the weapon is two shortswords emitting the same glow.

Untransformed: While wielding this greatsword, your senses are pushed to their limit. You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws. In addition, the weapon has the Light of Judgment property.

Light of Judgmen
t: As a bonus action, you can unleash judgment upon the heretics. The blade's light is summoned for the next minute or until you fall unconscious or transform the weapon. You and all hostile creatures within the bright light immediately take 2d8 radiant damage. In addition, for the duration, you deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage whenever you damage a creature with the épée, and radiant damage you deal ignores resistance to radiant damage.

Transformed: When you engage in two-weapon fighting with these shortswords, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. In addition, this weapon gains the Sunscorch property.

Sunscorch: Whenever you hit a creature two times in a turn with these shortswords, the accumulated solar energy detonates. Each creature in a 15-foot radius must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Proficiency: martial, longsword, great sword

    <name>Eldritch Carvings</name>
    <detail>eldritch carving, varies</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>The first eldritch rune was gifted upon the believers when their leader bowed before the God Shaped Hole. The apostle's flesh and bones were mangled and twisted, before being buried in the ground in the shape of a word of power. The ritual site has long since been lost and buried, and of the ones that witnessed the miracle, few are alive, and fewer still are sane.

Eldritch carvings, "words of power" as they used to be called, are the transcribed inhuman utterances of the Great Ones.

To be able to inscribe an eldritch carving upon flesh, one must possess a deep understanding of the word, and be able to perfectly replicate it in one's mind. The deeper the understanding, the less destructive the carving for the host.

Due to the high fatality rate of the practice, new methods were devised to extract the power of the carvings, and although less efficient, they are far safer. Carvings can be drawn, for their weakest form and lowest power, tattooed, or scarified—a form that unleashes their full might but presents the highest risk.

Eldritch Carving Limitations:
To apply a carving, one must be proficient with leatherworker's tools. Unlike most art, where the artist determines the quality of the art, with eldritch carvings, the canvas-the person getting carved—determines the quality of the work. The canvas must envision the rune in their mind as best they can, causing their body to distort under the eldritch pressure. The carver can then simply apply the necessary tool against the skin and let the eldritch powers move the brush, needle, or knife, depending on whether the eldritch carving is drawn, tattooed or scarified, respectively. This procedure takes 3 hours, and the canvas must make a saving throw at the end.

Drawn: A creature that has a carving drawn on its flesh must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it gains a short-term madness, takes 2d10 force damage, and the carving isn't drawn.

Tattooed: A creature that has a carving tattooed on its flesh must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it gains a long-term madness, takes 10d10 force damage, and the carving isn't tattooed.

Scarified: A creature that has a carving scarred on its flesh must succeed on a DC 29 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it gains an indefinite madness, takes 25d10 force damage, and the carving isn't scarified.

Success on the saving throw completes the carving. If the carving procedure is interrupted at any moment before the end, the saving throw automatically fails, inflicting the appropriate damage and madness to the canvas. If the damage of failing an eldritch carving reduces a creature to 0 hit points, its body is instantly disintegrated into a puddle of blood and gore. After the carving is complete, a creature is attuned to it (if required) and gains both the effects of the carving and the effects of its lesser carvings. For example, if an eldritch carving is Tattooed on your flesh, you gain the benefits of it being Tattooed and also those from it being Drawn. To remove a carving, the flesh where the carving is located needs to be thoroughly burnt. Burning a carving also removes attunement to it.

Some eldritch carvings, denoted as requires special attunement, do not count against your maximum number of attuned items. The DC of the Constitution saving throw can be increased or decreased, depending on the factors below (to a minimum of 0). Only one of the following can be applied at a time.

	• A creature that has seen the original carving and studied it for 8 hours can lower the DC of the saving throw by 15.

	• A creature that has seen a perfect copy of original carving and studied it for 8 hours can understand most of the eldritch essence, lowering the DC by 8.

	• A creature that has seen a near-perfect copy of the original carving and studied it for 8 hours can lower the DC of the saving throw by 4.

	• A creature that has seen an imperfect copy of the carving and studied it for 8 hours is misguided in their approach, and the DC of the saving throw is increased by 5.

Regulating Eldritch Carvings:
Given the unique nature of Eldritch Carvings and their ability to propagate easily amongst an adventuring party, simply through visual replication or the crafting of copies, it is essential to put certain boundaries in place to curb the possibility of an unchecked escalation of power. Here are some rules GMs can implement:

When a player learns from a copy of an Eldritch Carving, the copy then disappears. The player can attempt to create a duplicate of the carving, which necessitates a successful Sleight of Hand check rolled secretly by the GM. For the player to craft a perfect copy of the carving, they must obtain a 25 or above. A result of 20 or above results in a near perfect copy. However, anything below this number results in an unsuccessful copy, unbeknownst to the character.

In contrast, original Eldritch Carvings scarified onto flesh, can only be on a single individual at any given time. In order for another person to gain the powers granted by the original carving, the current bearer must willingly burn it away or be killed.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>During the initial days of the scourge, not all the afflicted turned to beasts. Most of them went mad, some unlucky few were devoured, but the hunger of those blood-thirsty enough to consume the flesh of both man and beast irreversibly twisted their soul and body. These cannibals did what they had to in order to survive, but became cursed, turning into the first of the crimson beasts, also known as the Moon-Blooded. The fate of a Moon-Blooded was to die an atrocious death, worthy of the weight of their sins.
	Such atrocities wouldn't go unnoticed, and one day all those who contracted this curse were found dead, their mangled corpses half buried within the ground. Who committed such an act? No one knows. In the ensuing days, those privy to the powers of eldritch carvings were quick to notice the pattern amidst the corpses, Martyr Tulio first among them.
	This eldritch rune engraved upon one's flesh allows the control of the curse it was created from. The host can shape their blood into weapons and use it to deflect deadly blows. Though powerful, if too much blood is spilled, the ancient curse awakens anew, devouring life and unleashing the terrifying crimson beast of old.

As a bonus action, you unleash the powers held within the carving, transforming into a crimson beast. You take necrotic damage equal to one roll of your hit die, which cannot be reduced in any way, and suffer this damage again for each minute you remain transformed. This transformation ends early if you fall unconscious or end it as a bonus action. The blood you lose shapes itself into one of the following powers:

	• Barbed Tail. A bloody tail erupts from your lower spine. As part of transforming and on subsequent turns as a bonus action, you can make a melee weapon attack with it. The tail is considered a simple melee weapon you are proficient with, has the finesse and reach properties, and deals 1d8 magical piercing damage on a hit.

	• Razor Claws. Your hands grow sharp claws that you can climb and kill with. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and your unarmed strikes deal an extra 1d6 magical slashing damage.

The carving's power protects your body when the situation is most dire. While attuned to this item, your AC increases by 2 while you are below half your hit point maximum.

In addition, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you lose control of yourself as your blood takes a life of its own and you go berserk. You regain 1 hit point and gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your hit point maximum. While berserk, you gain all the abilities of your crimson beast transformation and on each of your turns, you attack the nearest creature you can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, you attack an object, with preference for an object smaller than yourself. Once you go berserk, you stay in that state for 1 minute or until you fall unconscious. When it ends, you immediately drop to 0 hit points, are dying, and have 2 failed death saving throws. After you've gone berserk, you lose all the abilities from the eldritch carving for 1 week.

Thus began the magnificence of the once humble faction that would come to be known as the Scions. The carving embodies the raw power that serves as the bedrock of the Scions, infusing its possessor with the force of lightning. This allows them to traverse and assail with speed beyond mortal perception, or alternatively, employ the electricity to reanimate corpses through careful stimulation of the marrow.

You gain resistance to lightning damage.
	In addition, as a bonus action, you can teleport up to 20 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. This carving can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

TATTOOED
The distance you can teleport with this carving increases to 30 feet. After you teleport, your body becomes overcharged with electricity, and the next attack you make before the end of your next turn deals an extra 1d12 lightning damage on a hit.

SCARIFIED

The distance you can teleport with this carving increases to 60 feet and the lightning damage increases to 2d12. This carving can be used in this way a number of times equal to 2 + your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

If your body is infected with the cordyceps sinensis, it wipes this understanding away from your brain, and if you were not dead for longer than 100 years, you come back to life over the course of an hour. The carving closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses that were affecting you when you died. The fungus replaces damaged or missing organs or limbs. The more tissue you were missing, the more fungic your appearance. In addition, you gain the following benefits:

You learn 2 warlock cantrips of your choice, using Intelligence, Charisma, or Wisdom (choose one when you first receive this carving) as your spellcasting ability for these spells. In addition, you learn a warlock invocation of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites (you can treat invocations that require a certain warlock level as if they instead require a certain character level). When you gain a level, you can replace this invocation with another that you meet the prerequisites for.

If you are reduced to 0 hit points, you do not fall unconscious. You still make death saving throws and can be stabilized as normal. If you are stable for 1 minute, you regain 1 hit point.

If you die and haven't taken fire or radiant damage within the last minute, you come back to life with 1 hit point after an hour. If you are exposed to fire or radiant damage during that period, you do not resurrect.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This intricate carving is a rotten word, nauseating to those who hear it and causing plagues upon the world, or so the story goes. A rogue faction of manikins has managed to locate the original carving and have been using it to further their own goals, much to the dismay of beings of flesh-yet such power could so easily be turned against them.

Miasma of Death: As an action, you can conjure a toxic miasma in a 15-foot-radius sphere at a point you can see within 30 feet of you. The sphere spreads around corners. The miasma remains there until the end of your next turn. Each creature that is completely within the miasma at the start of its turn must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking a number of dos of poison damage equal to your proficiency bonus and becoming poisoned for the duration of the miasma on a failed save. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can use this carving twice, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

When you summon the miasma, it gains your choice of 1 property from the following list of options:

	• Obfuscation: The area becomes heavily obscured.

	• Immunity: You are immune to and ignore the effects of the miasma.

	• Duration: The miasma lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. You can move the miasma up to 10 feet as a bonus action on each of your turns. If this carving is scarified, you can move it up to 30 feet instead.

	• Radius: The radius increases to 25 feet.

	• Virulent: The damage dice become d12s instead of d6s.

	• Lingering: On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.

	• Corrosion: The miasma deals an extra number of d4s of acid damage equal to your proficiency bonus on a failed save. Creatures that fail the saving throw by 5 or more are blinded until the end of your next turn.

	• Destruction: You can cause the miasma to exude a corrosive substance that can eat through 1-inch-thick nonmagical wood, metal, or stone each round. If you do so, the miasma ignores resistance and immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and constructs have disadvantage on the saving throw.

	• Protection: When you summon the miasma, you can choose a number of creatures other than yourself equal to your proficiency bonus; they are immune to the effects of the miasma. You must concentrate on this carving as you would concentrate on a spell.

	• Hallucinatory Toxins: You turn your miasma into powerful hallucinogens, changing its damage type from poison to psychic. The saving throw becomes an Intelligence saving throw instead. Any other property of the miasma that inflicts poison damage instead inflicts psychic damage. You cannot use the Destruction property alongside this one.

    <text>The Third Carving is Mikha'el—The Left Hand of Creation, the herald of punishment.

War broke out in heaven. From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals of thunder, and before the throne were burning seven torches of fire. Mikha'el and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down-that ancient serpent called the devil, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.
—Tome of Revelations

When you roll initiative, you can choose to let the carving consume you for 1 minute (no action required). You gain the following benefits:

	• Wings of Judgement: Wings sprout on your back, granting you a flying speed of 30 feet. You can only use this speed to move towards a hostile creature that you can see.

	• Seraphic Blade: A blade of eldritch—or perhaps divine-energy appears in your hand. This blade is a magic weapon that has the finesse property and deals 1d6 fire and 1d6 psychic damage on a hit.

Once you use this carving, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

When you roll initiative, you can choose to let the carving consume you for 1 minute (no action required). You gain the following benefits:

	• Wings of Judgement: Wings sprout on your back, granting you a flying speed of 60 feet. You can only use this speed to move towards a hostile creature that you can see.

	• Righteous Punishment: Creatures that raise their hand against you—a chosen one—must be punished. When you take damage from a creature you can see within 120 feet, you can use your reaction to emit a psychic shockwave in its direction. The attacking creature must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, it takes psychic damage equal to your character level. On a success, it takes half as much damage. As part of the same reaction, you can cause a creature that failed its saving throw to be stunned until the end of your next turn. Once you stun a creature in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

	• Seraphic Blade: A blade of eldritch—or perhaps divine-energy appears in your hand. This blade is a magic weapon that has the finesse and thrown (range 60/120) properties, and it deals 1d8 fire and 1d8 psychic damage on a hit. Each time you throw the blade, it flies back to your hand after the attack.

Alternatively, you can cause the blade to fuse with a nonmagical weapon you are holding. If you do so, for the duration, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and you deal an extra 1d6 fire and 1d6 psychic damage on a hit.

A power that reflects the terror of what lies beyond, as this single word holds the potential to unravel reality in a myriad of ways.
	No mortal should be given this power of creation, their hubris begetting suffering and tyranny. The last possessor of this carving, the Godless King, proclaimed himself divine, turning the world into hell, for it meant that he could rule over its ashes as a god.

You understand Celestial and Deep Speech. Further, you are imbued with righteous power and gain the ability to cast spells. Constitution or Wisdom is your spellcasting modifier for these spells, whichever is higher. You can use each of the following decrees once, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Each decree only requires the verbal component of the spell.

King's Decrees:

	• Decree of Obedience: You force the heretic to kneel and worship. You can cast the command spell, using only the grovel command.

	• Decree of Power: You unleash destructive might. You can cast the bless spell on willing creatures. When a creature rolls a 1 on the d4 as part of this spell, it can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1. Creatures under the effect of the spell also take 1d4 necrotic damage (which cannot be reduced) at the start of each of their turns.

	• Decree of Blood: You harangue your soldiers to endure. You can cast the healing word spell on a willing creature. Until the end of the target's next turn, it gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, but each time it takes damage, it takes an extra 1d4 damage of the same type.

Aegis of the Almighty. You gain resistance to radiant damage. Friendly creatures of your choice within 15 feet of you have resistance to radiant damage while you are conscious. In addition, you can amplify the effect of your decrees. When you do so, you expend two uses instead of one.

	• Improved Decree of Obedience. When you cast command with this decree, you can target a number of creatures of your choice you can see within range equal to your Constitution or Wisdom modifier, whichever is higher.

	• Improved Decree of Power. When you cast bless with this decree, creatures under the effect of the spell gain an additional action on each of their turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The damage they take at the start of their turn increases to 2d4.

Until the end of the target's next turn, it gains a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, but each time it takes damage, it takes an extra 2d4 damage of the same type.

	None have seen the full power of this carving, as the original is sealed deep within the earth, guarded by a sin left behind by the Radiant Church.

When you give a person something to die for, you conversely give them something to live for.

At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a sanctuary spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Constitution or Wisdom modifier (whichever is higher) + your proficiency bonus.

Wings of Salvation: In addition, when a willing creature you can see within 60 feet of you is targeted by an attack roll or forced to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to give them wings to fly out of danger. A pair of angelic wings sprout on their back, which carries them in a straight line to you, where they land in an unoccupied space next to you. This can potentially cause the harmful effect to miss if the creature leaves the range of the effect. The wings then vanish.

    <name>Steinhardt's Madness System</name>
    <type/>
    <text>Steinhardt's Guide to the Eldritch Hunt contains numerous aberrations that can assail creature's minds. The following rules and effect detail the myriad ways that characters' minds can be debased, debauched, or otherwise defiled.

Madness Effects:
Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. More mundane effects, like the ones presented here, impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness.
	A creature's intellect can help it understand eldritch knowledge without breaking its mind. Characters can add their Intelligence modifier to saving throws they make against madness.

	• When a creature becomes afflicted by madness, be it short-term, long-term or indefinite, the creature is stunned (see the condition) until the start of its next turn, and then the madness takes effect.

	• A character afflicted with short-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d4 minutes.

	• A character afflicted with long-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d4 × Eldritch Moons (or 1d4 x 7 days, if you aren't using Eldritch Moons in your world).

	• A character afflicted with indefinite madness gains a new trait from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.

Madness and the Ethereal Plane:
When a creature in Luyarnha enters the Ethereal Plane for the first time in a day, they must succeed on a DO 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain a short-term madness and immediately be returned to the plane they were last on. Creatures of the GM's choice are immune to this effect.
	For each minute spent on the Ethereal Plane, a creature must repeat the saving throw.

Madness Guidelines:
Madness can be caused by various effects, creatures, and situations. Use the following guidelines to know when and where to apply madness.

Short-Term Madness Guidelines:
Short-term madness occurs more often than longer forms, and it can quickly trigger further madness. Short-term madness occurs when a character experiences something traumatic or mind-altering, but the effects are temporary and wear off after some time. To determine whether an event the characters encounter should cause short-term madness, consider the following guidelines:

Severity: The event should be extreme or unexpected enough to cause a psychological shock or temporary break from reality. Encountering an aberration for the first time could cause a saving throw for a short-term madness if the creature is horrifying or its presence is accompanied by a disturbing event (e.g., a gruesome murder scene). However, if the encounter is less extreme or the character is already somewhat familiar with this particular aberration, it might not result in such a saving throw.

Mental Resilience: Some characters might be more resistant to madness than others, depending on their background, class features, or experiences. For example, a seasoned adventurer or jaeger will be less likely to succumb to short-term madness than an untraveled novice.

Context and Setting: The circumstances surrounding the event play a significant role in determining whether short-term madness occurs. For example, encountering an aberration in a dark, confined space might be more terrifying than encountering it in a well-lit, open area. Similarly, discovering an aberration in the middle of a peaceful village could be more shocking than finding it in a known dangerous area, like an underground catacomb.

Madness Examples &amp; Guidelines:
The following non-exhaustive list aims to provide some examples to serve as guidelines on whether or not an effect should cause madness.

Spells:
	• Contact other plane (on a failed Intelligence saving throw): long-term madness.
	• Feeblemind (on a failed Intelligence saving throw): indefinite madness.
	• Osteomancy spells: short-term madness the first time one encounters the school of magic.
	• Planeshift: long-term or indefinite madness, depending on the destination's connection to eldritch or horror.
	• Symbol, Insanity (on a failed Intelligence saving throw): indefinite madness.

Creatures:
	• First encounter with an unknown type of aberration of CR 7 or lower: short-term madness.
	• First encounter with an unknown type of aberration of CR 8 or higher: long-term madness.
	• First encounter with an unknown type of monstrosity of CR 5 or higher: short-term madness.
	• Being swallowed by an aberration: short-term madness.
	• Seeing an ally reduced to 0 hit points for the first time in a day due to a monstrosity or aberration: shortterm madness.

Situations And Environments:
	• Attuning to cursed items: short-term (common or uncommon), long-term (rare, very rare), or indefinite madness (legendary or artifact).
	• Exposure to eldritch incursions on the Material Plane (e.g., eyes on the walls or ancient scriptures made of blood appearing on walls): short-term, long-term, or indefinite madness, depending on the severity or extent.
	• Traumatic events, such as witnessing a horrifying death or being tortured: short-term, long-term, or perhaps even indefinite madness, depending on the intensity and duration of the event.
	• Prolonged isolation or exposure to extreme environments: short-term or long-term madness, depending on the severity and duration of the isolation or exposure.
	• Entering a nightmare or other horrifying planes: short-term or long-term madness, depending on the nature of the plane and its influence.
	• Ingesting or being exposed to drugs, poisons, or abusing other substances that alter perception or induce hallucinations: short-term madness.
	• Witnessing or participating in gruesome, evil, or forbidden rituals: short-term or long-term madness, particularly if the characters are exposed to horrifying sights, come into contact with eldritch powers, or witness the summoning of alien entities.
	• Uncovering the results of twisted magical or scientific experiments, such as mutated creatures or disturbing fusions of life and machinery: short-term or long-term madness, depending on the inhumanity of the experiments.

GM Note:
If you don't know when to apply long-term or indefinite madness, here is a rule of thumb to follow. Each time a character accumulates five forms of short-term madness in less than 48 hours, they gain a form of long-term madness. If a character gains three forms of long-term madness in less than 30 days, they gain a form of indefinite madness. Feel free to alter these numbers if you want to see more or less madness in your game.

Curing Madness:
Different types of madness have different methods for curing them. What can cure indefinite madness can also cure long-term and short-term madness, and what can cure long-term madness can also cure short-term madness. The opposite isn't true.

Short-term madness: A character suffering from shortterm madness can be cured with a lesser restoration spell or by waiting for the madness to subside naturally.

Long-term madness: A character suffering from longterm madness can be cured with a greater restoration spell or a modify memory spell if the traumatic event happened in the time window necessary for the spell to work.

Indefinite madness: A character suffering from indefinite madness can be cured with a wish spell. Alternatively, they can be killed and brought back completely sane with a true resurrection spell.
	If you want to make indefinite madness easier to remove, you can allow the use of greater restoration to cure the character if both the caster and the target are located within an area sanctified by a hallow spell.

GM Note:
A drunk or intoxicated character could suffer one or all the following effects: Disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks; -1d4 penalty to its attack rolls; Advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

Temporary Cures:
Sometimes curing madness is impossible, and alleviating the symptoms is the only option. What can temporarily cure indefinite madness can also temporarily cure longterm and short-term madness, and what can temporarily cure long-term madness can also temporarily cure shortterm madness. The opposite isn't true.

Short-term madness: A character suffering from short-term madness can be temporarily cured by:

	• A calm emotions spell for the duration of the spell.
	• Having a Momentum die (e.g., Jaeger in battle).

Long-term madness: A character suffering from longterm madness can be temporarily cured by:

	• Being within the area of a hallow or holy aura spell.
	• Being under the effect of a mind blank spell.
	• Being located inside of a holy site dedicated to a god that wards off eldritch influences (such as the Radiant One or the Abyss Warden).
	• Being severely under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.

Indefinite madness: A character suffering from indefinite madness can be temporarily cured by:

	• Being located inside of a holy site dedicated to a god that wards off eldritch influences (such as the Radiant One or the Abyss Warden) or a hallow spell and being under the effect of a mind blank or holy aura spell.

    <text>When a character is afflicted with short-term madness, roll a d100 on the table below, then roll a d10 to determine the effect of that form of madness. All effects are for the duration of the madness unless specified otherwise.

Short-Term Madness table:

1-10 - Your mind is liberated from any sense of self you may possess:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Without an ego, you are immune to the charmed condition.
3-8 | You mimic the mannerisms, behavior, and speech patterns of the creature closest to you when you gained this madness.
8-10 | Desperate to find yourself again and believing anything, you automatically fail saving throws against being charmed.

11-20 - Your mind is invaded by the sound of the cosmos:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Painful sounds pale in comparison to the cacophony in your head; you are immune to thunder damage.
3-8 | Eldritch utterings scratch your brain; you hear the soft caress of whispers behind your back.
8-10 | The sound of the cosmos drowns out all other noise, closing you to the world. You are deafened and have disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain your concentration.

21-30 - You have seen too much; your mind can't understand it, causing your sight to become erratic and unreliable:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your vision expands as if you are under the effect of the see invisibility spell.
3-8 | Spectral forms flitter at the corners of your eyes, vanishing when you turn your head.
8-10 | You are blinded, and you can't use any special senses you use to see, such as blindsight or tremorsense.

31-40 - The madness inside you bursts forth as haunting screams:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your scream is so loud that it can cause damage. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can scream at a creature you see within 30 feet of you. If the target can hear you, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 1d12 thunder damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success.
3-8 | You can't talk properly; yelling is the only way you can communicate.
8-10 | Your screams are so overwhelming that any creature within 300 feet of you can hear you talk. You also can't form coherent sentences or utter the vocal components of spells.

41-50 - Your posture crumples, as you try to make sense of the insanity before you:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | You become incredibly skittish. When you are the target of an attack or an effect that requires you to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to begin moving evasively, gaining a +1 bonus to AC and advantage on Dexterity saving throws until the start of your next turn.
3-8 | You desperately look for a parental figure that can protect you. Once you find such a person, you latch on to them and refuse to leave their side, no matter what.
8-10 | You fall prone and can't stand, as your legs refuse to obey you, and you can't use any flying speed you possess.

51-60 - You realize that your hands are blasphemous tools:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | These tools can break the minds of your foes. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to it.
3-8 | You refuse to use your hands for anything, keeping them hidden from view. If someone stares at them, it makes you extremely uncomfortable and defensive.
8-10 | You shouldn't touch anything. You drop anything you are holding, and can't hold items or grapple creatures.

61-70 - Your body breaks down under the insanity:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | You are immune to the poisoned condition.
3-8 | You start emitting a foul smell that is unpleasant even to you, and no amount of washing or magic can remove it.
8-10 | You are poisoned, even if you are immune to the condition.

71-80 - The Eldritch Horrors are revealed to you, bathing you in fear:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | When you gain this madness, each creature within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
3-8 | You become paranoid and fearful of any movement or sound.
8-10 | You become frightened of your allies. You must take the Dash action and move away from them by the quickest available route on each of your turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If you start your turn in a location where you can't see any of your allies, you can use your action to end the madness.

81-90 - The madness breaks your mind:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | You realize your mind has been holding back your body, and you can now act freely. You have an additional action on each of your turns. That action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.
3-8 | You burst into spontaneous fits of laughter randomly, even at the most inappropriate times.
8-10 | You are incapacitated. This effect ends early if you take damage equal to twice your level or if a greater restoration spell is cast on you.

91-95 - The revelations from beyond afflict you:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your body ignores all pain; only the Eldritch Truth matters. You are immune to the stunned condition.
3-8 | You speak to others of the Eldritch Truth in a way that seems limpid to you, but is perhaps not so clear to others. Your sentences are cryptic for the unascended mind.
8-10 | You are stunned. This effect ends early if you take damage equal to your level or if a greater restoration spell is cast on you.

96-100 - The beast within you awakens and attempts to take control:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your body releases its animalistic instincts, without the influence of your mind to restrain it. You are under the effect of the haste spell, although it doesn't require concentration. The spell ends when the madness does.
3-8 | Your speech is slurred, as if you're intoxicated, and you punctuate your sentences with animal noises.
8-10 | You fall unconscious, your mind fighting its hardest to not let you become a beast. This effect ends early if you take damage equal to your level or if a greater restoration spell is cast on you.

    <text>When a character is afflicted with long-term madness, roll a d100 on the table below, then roll a d10 to determine the effect of that form of madness. All effects are for the duration of the madness and can only be cured once the madness ends, unless specified otherwise.

1-10 - The eldritch corruption profoundly weakens your body:
d10 |  Long-Term Madness
1-2 | Your frail body is easily pushed around; each time you take damage you are pushed back 10 feet.
3-7 | You are easily fatigued, and physical effort puts a heavy toll on your body. You require 4 more hours than usual to finish a long rest.
8-10 | Your legs can barely hold you up; each time you take damage you are knocked prone.

11-20 - Otherworldly magic stirs within you:
d10 |  Long-Term Madness
1-2 | Your contact with the beyond awakens powers within you. You learn one random cantrip from the warlock spell list. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
3-7 | You become repulsed by this world's magic. Each time you cast or are affected by a spell, you retch and reel, losing your reaction until the start of your next turn.
8-10 | You cannot handle the newfound magic within you, which sporadically seeps from you when injured. Whenever you take 15 or more points of damage from a single attack, you explode in a discharge of arcane energy. You and each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d 10 force damage. This explosion cannot be triggered again for 1d6 rounds.

21-30 - Your sense of worth shatters:
d10 |  Long-Term Madness
1-2 | Intense paranoia forces you to be on the alert for anything and anyone, protecting what little is left of you. You gain a 1d4 bonus to any Perception or Insight check that you make.
3-7 | You are sulking and sullen; these negative thoughts in your head cause you to demean yourself during any conversation you have.
8-10 | Your worthlessness seeps into every aspect of your life, gnawing at whatever remnant of competence you have left. You have a -1d4 penalty to any ability check you make.

31-40 - You lose perception of your power:
d10 |  Long-Term Madness
1-2 | Not realizing your limits, you push yourself beyond what you are capable of. Whenever you deal damage, add damage equal to one roll of the lowest damage die used.
3-7 | You don't realize your strength; whenever you have to use your body, you either apply too much force or not enough. Your handshakes can be like a vice grip or dead fish, your hugs suffer the same fate, and any other physical activity you try to perform is a gamble.
8-10 | Afraid of shattering your body, you involuntarily restrain your power. Whenever you deal damage, subtract damage equal to one roll of the lowest damage die used (minimum 0).

41-50 - The Eldritch Truth reveals itself to you:
d10 |  Long-Term Madness
1-2 | Able to understand this Truth, you gain proficiency in a random Intelligence skill (chosen by the GM) and can add twice your proficiency bonus to any check you make using that skill.
3-7 | You become fascinated by what lies beyond. Whenever you notice or hear of something of eldritch nature, you drop whatever you are doing to enquire more about it and attempt to get closer to it, physically or otherwise.
8-10 | The revelations from beyond beckon to you, urging you to learn more, to be more. You have disadvantage on saving throws against madness.

51-60 | The madness ignites your nervous system, melting it away:
d10 |  Long-Term Madness
1-2 | Any pain you would feel completely vanishes. You are immune to being stunned and can only fall unconscious as a result of reaching 0 hit points.
3-7 | Your damaged nerves transmit a constant feeling of itchiness. This feeling vanishes when your skin is in direct contact with metal.
8-10 | You are in constant pain from the nerve damage, which prevents you from focusing or bringing your utmost in battle. You can't add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class and have disadvantage on all Dexterity checks and saving throws.

61-70 | Powers from beyond grasp you and merge with your body:
d10 |  Long-Term Madness
1-2 | You manage to bring these otherworldly powers under your control. You have advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. In addition, if you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. If you do, you then need to roll on the long-term madness table again, gaining a new effect.
3-7 | Attempting to understand what has merged with you, you start experiencing derealization. You are completely alienated from your surroundings at all times and get surprised by any physical contact.
8-10 | These new powers are too much for you to handle, draining your mind. You have disadvantage on Intelligence checks, Wisdom checks, and Charisma checks, as well as Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration.

71-80 | Your heart begins to falter; such a reality cannot possibly exist:
d10 |  Long-Term Madness
1-2 | Your elevated heart rate increases your awareness. You gain a +3 bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score and your initiative rolls.
3-7 | The unexpected is too much for you to handle. Whenever you are surprised, you scream at the top of your lungs. If you are surprised in combat, you fall unconscious until the start of your next turn.
8-10 | Your heart weakens, literally. You gain a level of exhaustion which cannot be removed until the madness ends. Whenever you become frightened, you gain another level of exhaustion. Apart from the first, exhaustion gained from this madness can be removed as normal.

81-90 | Your futile attempts at staving off the madness have left your body scarred:
d10 |  Long-Term Madness
1-2 | The scar tissue only thickens your skin. You gain a + 1 bonus to AC.
3-7 | The scars that cover your body are beyond repulsive, causing most people to experience fear at their sight, especially children. You have a +2 bonus to Intimidation checks and a -2 penalty to Persuasion checks.
8-10 | You suffer severe scarring over an extensive portion of your anatomy. Anytime you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you suffer an extra id6 damage of that type.

91-95 | The madness causes your body to rot, unable to withstand the eldritch influence:
d10 |  Long-Term Madness
1-2 | Your mind embraces the idea that your body will rot away, and welcomes it; after all, everyone withers away eventually. You have immunity to the poisoned condition.
3-7 | The rot within your body is nauseating. You experience a constant feeling of disgust, and any time you smell something foul, you spend your action heaving.
8-10 | Vicious wounds of eldritch nature ravage your flesh. Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 every 24 hours. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. You or another creature can tend to the wounds during a long rest, making a DC 16 Medicine check once every 24 hours. After five successes, the wounds heals.

96-100 - The beast within you awakens and takes control:
d10 |  Long-Term Madness
1-2 | Most of your humanity remains, yet enough of the beast is unleashed. You gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws. In addition, each of your hands transforms into a claw, which you can use as a weapon if it's empty. It deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you attack with a claw using the Attack action, you can make one additional claw attack as part of the same action.
3-7 | Your body transforms, yet a trace of your humanity remains. Your race becomes scourgeborne, with a random subrace. Scourgebornes and constructed races, such as manikins, are immune to this effect. If you're already a scourgeborne, the next madness effect applies instead.
8-10 | Your body transforms into a beast or monstrosity of the GM's choice with CR equal to half your level (rounded up). Apart from this, your transformation follows the rules of the polymorph spell, though if you fall to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious instead of reverting to your normal form.

    <text>When a character is afflicted with indefinite madness, roll a d100 on the table below, then roll a d10 to determine the effect of that form of madness. All effects are for the duration of the madness and can only be cured once the madness ends, unless specified otherwise.

Disclaimer: Some of the madness effects contain references to self-harm and suicide (notably rolling an 11-15 on the d100), which is a sensitive topic. While their use can be integral to the story being told, it is important to ensure that everyone at the table comes to an agreement regarding their use prior to the session beginning, and if it's included, whether descriptions should fade to black or be more detailed.

1-5 - You become heavily reliant on substances to cope with the meaninglessness of this painful existence:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | If you have a bad habit, such as drinking or drugs, it takes over and you become addicted. If you have no such habit, you develop alcoholism. You take a -3 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks, but if you are under the effect of the substance, you also gain a +3 bonus to saving throws against the frightened condition or further madness.
3-7 | You begin to heavily medicate yourself to numb the pain of life. You develop one of the following vices most in line with your personality: promiscuity, drug abuse, alcoholism, or smoking. If you do not partake in your vice at least twice every 24 hours, you suffer from a -1d6 penalty to Wisdom saving throws until you do so.
8-10 | Drugs, alcohol, and other vices stop having any effect on you. You immediately expel any vices consumed before you can metabolize them and are repulsed by all carnal thoughts.

6-10 - Life is bad and is only getting worse:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | Whenever you fail an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you have disadvantage on your next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.
3-7 | You feel the world is rotting and become reluctant to try anything new, only relying on what you know has worked in the past. You categorically refuse to try anything new that you haven't experienced before gaining this madness, such as a new spell, feature, or tavern.
8-10 | In the past, you may have been a promising individual, but those days are long gone. You are no longer proficient in any skills and instead suffer a penalty equal to your proficiency bonus to any skills in which you were proficient. If an ability allows you to gain a bonus to a check (such as Expertise or Jack of All Trades), you can no longer do so.

11-15 - You develop a hatred of your own body:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | When you first develop this madness, it doesn't manifest itself until you are alone for 10 seconds or more with a blade. You self amputate a limb in anger and destroy the removed appendice of flesh.
3-7 | You begin to wear mountains of clothing that hide as much of your body as possible and refuse to show even an inch of skin to anyone. If you realize that your skin has become exposed, you have disadvantage on all checks and attack rolls until you hide it again.
8-10 | Perhaps it would be better if your soul left this wretched body. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you gain two failed death saving throws, and you automatically fail any further death saving throws.

16-20 - You lose the ability to manage your stress properly:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | Whenever you are exposed to a stressful situation, you burst into a frenzy, attacking the origin of your stress recklessly until it dies or you are knocked unconscious. The GM determines when you are in a stressful situation.
3-7 | You automatically fail saving throws against the frightened condition and can't benefit from effects that would otherwise make you immune to fear.
8-10 | Whenever you are exposed to a stressful or social situation, you retreat within yourself. You have disadvantage on all Charisma and Dexterity checks and lose any boastfulness your character may have.

21-25 - Your eyes begin to blister as the Eldritch Truth reveals itself to you:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | You become blind and cannot regain sight while afflicted by this madness.
3-7 | You gain the ability to see into the Ethereal Plane but lose the ability to see the Material Plane. You are blinded to creatures and objects on the Material Plane.
8-10 | Your eyes grow dark and you despise the light. While in sunlight or bright moonlight, you have disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Perception checks that rely on sight.

26-30 - The madness ignites your nervous system, and your mind begins to beckon the pain:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | Your subconscious screams at you, urging you to suffer the pain. You have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that deal damage to you, and attack rolls against you have advantage. In exchange, you have advantage on saving throws against non-damaging effects, as your mind sees them as beneath you.
3-7 | Whenever you take more than 20 points of damage in a turn, your body detonates psychically. You and all creatures within 30 feet of you must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 3d10 psychic damage. You have disadvantage on this saving throw.
8-10 | You become fascinated with the afterlife. Whenever a creature within your sight is unconscious and at 0 hit points, you feel the urge to finish them off, and must use your turn to try to kill them.

31-35 - Mysterious powers from beyond grasp you, and you attempt to cope in various ways:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | You become obsessed with one object in your possession. If that item isn't precisely right all the time, it gnaws away at your peace of mind. While that item is not right, you have disadvantage on all ability checks and attack rolls.
3-7 | Initially, nothing happens. [Only the GM can know the following] The next time you fall unconscious in battle, you develop a severe trauma around it. If you encounter that enemy in battle again while under the effect of this madness, you become cursed. While cursed in this way, when you finish a long rest, you must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, your mind wrestles with your past failures, and you do not gain the benefits of the long rest.
8-10 | You develop a strange phobia. It could be fear of long words, the dark, or another aspect of your life. Talk with your GM to decide which one would suit your character.

36-40 - Your heart begins to falter; such a reality cannot possibly exist:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | You lose contact with reality. You start seeing people that don't exist and hearing sounds that aren't there. This effect also applies in battle, where you see enemies that aren't on the battlefield. Make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of your turns. On a failed save, you must use your action to attack one target of the GM's choice.
3-7 | You become a compulsive liar. You must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw each time you attempt to tell the truth. On a failure, you lie, even when it's against your best interest.
8-10 | You become obsessed with stealing small, valuable items. When you notice these items, you must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw to resist the urge to steal. On a failure, you attempt to steal something nearby, regardless of the consequences.

41-45 - You begin to lose control of your nerves and mind:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | Your senses become painfully heightened, causing discomfort and confusion. Unable to gain mental clarity amidst the cacophony of your senses, you have disadvantage on any ability checks that rely on sight, hearing, smell, taste, or touch, and disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.
3-7 | You randomly teleport a short distance (10 to 60 feet) at inopportune moments. The GM determines the timing and destination of these teleportations.
8-10 | You broadcast your thoughts telepathically to creatures within a 60-foot radius, losing the ability to keep secrets or to surprise any creature within range.

46-50 - Your body mutates in maladaptive ways:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | You become extremely sensitive to a specific element (fire, cold, lightning, acid, poison, or thunder), feeling intense pain even from minor exposure. You become vulnerable to that damage type. This effect removes any resistance or immunity you might have to that damage type.
3-7 | You become a walking lightning rod. Any lightning or effects that deal lightning damage within 120 feet of you also bend in your direction, striking you as well. Further, you automatically fail saving throws against effects that deal lightning damage.
8-10 | You lose all the hair on your body, leading to thermoregulation problems. Manikins are immune to this effect. You have disadvantage on saving throws against extreme cold and heat. Further, you have disadvantage on saving throws against diseases and poison, and you lose any resistance to poison damage.

51-55 - Your body perceives reality in abnormal ways:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | Your body phases in and out of reality, causing it to partially pass through objects and creatures. When you make an attack or cast a spell, there is a 50% chance it phases into the Ethereal Plane and passes harmlessly through your targets.
3-7 | You perceive distances inaccurately, with objects appearing closer or farther away than they actually are. You have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls and Perception checks that rely on sight.
8-10 | You experience time at an inconsistent pace, with moments seeming to stretch or compress unpredictably. You have disadvantage on initiative rolls and must roll a d6 at the start of each of your turns to determine which actions you can take (1-2: one action, bonus action, or movement; 3-4: one movement, and either one action or one bonus action; 5-6: no change).

56-60 - Your mind begins to play tricks on you, feeding you delusions:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | You become overly confident and take unnecessary risks. You must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw before attempting any cautious or well-thought-out action. On a failure, you act impulsively instead.
3-7 | You believe you are a deity, royalty, or another powerful figure, and have disadvantage on all Wisdom and Charisma checks when interacting with others.
8-10 | You believe you are of another race. You can only speak in that race's native language, and if that language isn't Common, you lose the ability to speak Common. If you don't already know that race's language, you instead produce sounds that seem close to the language, but are in reality complete gibberish.

61-65 - You develop antisocial personality traits, becoming the embodiment of chaos and madness:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | Whenever you roll initiative, you begin to dance. At the start of each of your turns, you must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw to stop dancing for that turn. On a failure, you continue to dance, as per the irresistible dance spell.
3-7 | You are overcome with fits of uncontrollable laughter at inappropriate times, making it difficult to communicate or concentrate. If you are concentrating on a spell, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of your turns or lose concentration. Further, you have disadvantage on Stealth checks.
8-10 | You become ravenous and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to consume any food, including unappetizing, rancid, or downright abhorrent sustenance you come across.

66-70 - You become plagued by a transcendent hatred:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | You develop an alternate personality that attempts to destroy everything you care for and nurture anything you despise.
3-7 | You develop an irrational hatred for a specific creature, object, or situation of the GM's choice. You must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw when you encounter the hated subject or become hostile toward it for 1 hour, or until the target is removed from your sight or is destroyed.
8-10 | You gleam at the idea of betrayal. Whenever multiple creatures are within range of an attack you are about to make, roll a d20. On a10 or lower, you randomly target another creature instead of your original target.

71-75 - Your body starts acting in strange ways:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | Your Strength and Dexterity scores become reversed.
3-7 | You become convinced that you're suffering from a grave illness, which may or may not be real, and have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws and checks.
8-10 | Your creature type becomes undead. Manikins lose any shred of humanity they had and become constructs. Magical healing has no effect on you.

76-80 Trauma seeps into your mind:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | You become plagued by nightmares, leaving you perpetually exhausted. If you have fewer than 2 levels of exhaustion when you finish a long rest, you rouse with 2 levels of exhaustion.
3-7 | You gain an intense fear of a certain creature type (GM's choice). If you are within 10 feet of that creature type, you must use your movement and action to Dash away from them on your turn. In addition, creatures of that type have advantage on opportunity attacks against you.
8-10 | The horrors you've seen tie your tongue and throat. You lose the ability to speak and make sounds, including the vocal components of spells.


81-85 - The Eldritch beckons:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | The moon, and all its eldritch forms, beckon you. You have disadvantage on any saving throw caused by lunar effects (direct or indirect), and you have advantage on all ability checks regarding knowledge of the moon.
3-7 | Your Eldritch Ascension fails. Your speed is reduced by half, and you lose the ability to teleport. If you are teleported against your will, such as with a banishment spell, you take 3d 10 force damage as the cosmos takes its pound from your flesh as punishment.
8-10 | Your Eldritch Ascension partially succeeds. Your creature type changes to aberration. You gain resistance to psychic damage, have advantage on saving throws against telepathy, but lose all empathy, conferring disadvantage on Insight and Persuasion checks. In addition, you understand Deep Speech, and you have disadvantage on saving throws against charm effects from aberrations.

86-100 - The beast within you awakens and takes control:
d10 | Indefinite-Term Madness
1-2 | The beast begins to gnaw at your mind, forcing you to stay alert to ward it. Whenever you fall unconscious, roll 1d2. On a 1, your mind loses control and the next time you awaken, the beast within you holds control over your body. Until you next fall unconscious, you are under the GM's control as the chaotic evil beast within you seeks to join other beasts and banish you from your body. On a 2, you maintain or reclaim your sanity upon rousing.
3-7 | Your body transforms, yet a trace of your humanity remains. Your race becomes scourgeborne. Talk with your GM to determine the subrace most appropriate for your character. Nothing short of a wish spell can undo this transformation. If you're already a scourgeborne, treat this roll as a 10 and apply the madness effects below instead.
8-10 | You become a beast or monstrosity of the GM's choice with a CR equal to half your level (rounded up), and you lose your mind. You become a creature under the GM's control.
