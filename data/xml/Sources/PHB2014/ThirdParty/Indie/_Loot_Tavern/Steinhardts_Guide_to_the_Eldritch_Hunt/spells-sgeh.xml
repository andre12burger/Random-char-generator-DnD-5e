    <text>You flick your finger against a creature. The target is impacted by a devastating gravitational force and must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 120 feet away from you. The push stops early if the creature hits a solid surface or is pushed into a creature of its size or larger. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
	If the target is pushed into or through the space of a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage is increased by 1d10 per size smaller the creature is than the target.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the target takes an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 30 additional feet for each slot level above 4th.

Note: For example, if a commoner (size Medium) is pushed into a frog (size Tiny), the frog must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. Because the frog is 2 sizes smaller than the commoner, on a failed save, it would take 3d10 damage (the original 1d10 damage, which is increased by 2d10), probably exploding on impact, whilst the commoner would continue its destructive flight unhindered-questioning the laws of physics.

On a hit, the target takes 4d6 necrotic damage. Choose another creature within range; it regains a number of hit points equal to half the damage dealt, or if it was dead for less than 1 minute, the creature returns to life with hit points equal to the number regained. If any of the targets do not have bones, the spell fails. This spell can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.

It must rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight, and creatures can't pass through it. The wall is an object, and has AC 15, 150 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points destroys it.
	When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest route and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
	Until the spell ends, and as long as the wall has sufficient hit points, you can use an action to sacrifice 20 hit points from the wall to summon a minotaur skeleton that has murderous killing intent. The creature appears in an unoccupied space of your choice adjacent to the wall. When you summon a minotaur skeleton in this way, designate a creature you can see within 60 feet of it; that creature becomes the sole enemy of the summoned creature. The minotaur skeleton ignores any orders you give, tries to kill its target by any means, and is immune to being charmed. Once its target is dead, it vanishes in a pile of dust.
	You can have a maximum of three creatures summoned by this spell at a time.

    <text>You call upon the power of the Great Ones, seeking their guidance. Until the spell ends, you gain the ability to cast any spell from the warlock spell list of 5th level or lower without expending a spell slot or needing to prepare the spell. As part of casting this spell, you can cast a spell with a casting time of an action from your newfound spell list. However, the cost of using this power is steep. At the end of each of your turns, you must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 2d10 psychic damage. If you fail this saving throw two times, the spell ends early and you gain a short-term madness.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, it no longer requires concentration, though you can choose to end the spell whenever.

Short-Term Madness:
When a character is afflicted with short-term madness, roll a d100 on the table below, then roll a d10 to determine the effect of that form of madness. All effects are for the duration of the madness unless specified otherwise.

Short-Term Madness table:

1-10 - Your mind is liberated from any sense of self you may possess:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Without an ego, you are immune to the charmed condition.
3-8 | You mimic the mannerisms, behavior, and speech patterns of the creature closest to you when you gained this madness.
8-10 | Desperate to find yourself again and believing anything, you automatically fail saving throws against being charmed.

11-20 - Your mind is invaded by the sound of the cosmos:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Painful sounds pale in comparison to the cacophony in your head; you are immune to thunder damage.
3-8 | Eldritch utterings scratch your brain; you hear the soft caress of whispers behind your back.
8-10 | The sound of the cosmos drowns out all other noise, closing you to the world. You are deafened and have disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain your concentration.

21-30 - You have seen too much; your mind can't understand it, causing your sight to become erratic and unreliable:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your vision expands as if you are under the effect of the see invisibility spell.
3-8 | Spectral forms flitter at the corners of your eyes, vanishing when you turn your head.
8-10 | You are blinded, and you can't use any special senses you use to see, such as blindsight or tremorsense.

31-40 - The madness inside you bursts forth as haunting screams:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your scream is so loud that it can cause damage. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can scream at a creature you see within 30 feet of you. If the target can hear you, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 1d12 thunder damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success.
3-8 | You can't talk properly; yelling is the only way you can communicate.
8-10 | Your screams are so overwhelming that any creature within 300 feet of you can hear you talk. You also can't form coherent sentences or utter the vocal components of spells.

41-50 - Your posture crumples, as you try to make sense of the insanity before you:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | You become incredibly skittish. When you are the target of an attack or an effect that requires you to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to begin moving evasively, gaining a +1 bonus to AC and advantage on Dexterity saving throws until the start of your next turn.
3-8 | You desperately look for a parental figure that can protect you. Once you find such a person, you latch on to them and refuse to leave their side, no matter what.
8-10 | You fall prone and can't stand, as your legs refuse to obey you, and you can't use any flying speed you possess.

51-60 - You realize that your hands are blasphemous tools:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | These tools can break the minds of your foes. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to it.
3-8 | You refuse to use your hands for anything, keeping them hidden from view. If someone stares at them, it makes you extremely uncomfortable and defensive.
8-10 | You shouldn't touch anything. You drop anything you are holding, and can't hold items or grapple creatures.

61-70 - Your body breaks down under the insanity:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | You are immune to the poisoned condition.
3-8 | You start emitting a foul smell that is unpleasant even to you, and no amount of washing or magic can remove it.
8-10 | You are poisoned, even if you are immune to the condition.

71-80 - The Eldritch Horrors are revealed to you, bathing you in fear:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | When you gain this madness, each creature within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
3-8 | You become paranoid and fearful of any movement or sound.
8-10 | You become frightened of your allies. You must take the Dash action and move away from them by the quickest available route on each of your turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If you start your turn in a location where you can't see any of your allies, you can use your action to end the madness.

81-90 - The madness breaks your mind:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | You realize your mind has been holding back your body, and you can now act freely. You have an additional action on each of your turns. That action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.
3-8 | You burst into spontaneous fits of laughter randomly, even at the most inappropriate times.
8-10 | You are incapacitated. This effect ends early if you take damage equal to twice your level or if a greater restoration spell is cast on you.

91-95 - The revelations from beyond afflict you:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your body ignores all pain; only the Eldritch Truth matters. You are immune to the stunned condition.
3-8 | You speak to others of the Eldritch Truth in a way that seems limpid to you, but is perhaps not so clear to others. Your sentences are cryptic for the unascended mind.
8-10 | You are stunned. This effect ends early if you take damage equal to your level or if a greater restoration spell is cast on you.

96-100 - The beast within you awakens and attempts to take control:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your body releases its animalistic instincts, without the influence of your mind to restrain it. You are under the effect of the haste spell, although it doesn't require concentration. The spell ends when the madness does.
3-8 | Your speech is slurred, as if you're intoxicated, and you punctuate your sentences with animal noises.
8-10 | You fall unconscious, your mind fighting its hardest to not let you become a beast. This effect ends early if you take damage equal to your level or if a greater restoration spell is cast on you.

    <text>You dramatically increase the pull of gravity in a 30-footradius, 300-foot-high cylinder centered on a point on the ground within range. Creatures in this area are knocked prone and cannot lose this condition while there. A creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there is knocked prone and takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage. A flying creature in the area immediately falls to the ground and is knocked prone. A creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw to move or perform any action. Each foot of movement while in the area costs a creature 3 extra feet.
	A prone creature that ends its turn in the cylinder must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced into the ground as gravity pulls it down. It is restrained and incapacitated by the crushing pressure and the ground around it, but it gains the benefits of three-quarters cover, as only the upper part of their body is visible. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, freeing itself from the ground on a success.
	If the spell lasts for its full duration, the ground cracks under the tremendous weight generated and becomes difficult terrain. Each 5-foot-square area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand to remove the difficult terrain.

    <text>You focus threads of magical energy around you which coalesce into the aspect of death, an avatar made of bones, which surrounds you and fights on your behalf.
	The avatar is Large, is centered on you, and moves with you. While it is summoned, it protects you from foes;
you are considered behind three-quarters cover at all times, have resistance to all damage, are immune to being grappled, and no other creature can enter the space of the avatar.
	In addition, while active, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and saving throws, and when you cast a spell that deals bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage, it is cast with a spell slot 2 levels higher than the one expended (to a maximum of 9th level).

    <text>When you cast this spell, you create a crack in the world, letting the will of a Great One smother a creature of your choice within range. The direct contact with the eldritch being causes the target to take 8d6 psychic damage, and it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature is pulled in through the tear to the cosmos. On a success, it isn't pulled but gains a long-term madness, and the spell ends.
	While in the cosmos, the target is incapacitated. At the beginning of each of its turns while there, it takes 3d6 cold damage, 3d6 psychic damage, and must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or gain a short-term madness.
	When the spell ends, if the target is still alive, it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. If the creature is killed while in the void, its corpse never returns. A body that disappears in this way can never be recovered, not even with a wish spell.
	If your concentration on the spell ends early, you must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or gain a long-term madness as the eldritch whispers revolt and assault your mind.
	When the spell ends, roll a d100. On a 1, the breach doesn't close and instead only expands, threatening to absorb the entire world.

Short-Term Madness:
When a character is afflicted with short-term madness, roll a d100 on the table below, then roll a d10 to determine the effect of that form of madness. All effects are for the duration of the madness unless specified otherwise.

Short-Term Madness table:

11-20 - Your mind is invaded by the sound of the cosmos:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Painful sounds pale in comparison to the cacophony in your head; you are immune to thunder damage.
3-8 | Eldritch utterings scratch your brain; you hear the soft caress of whispers behind your back.
8-10 | The sound of the cosmos drowns out all other noise, closing you to the world. You are deafened and have disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain your concentration.

21-30 - You have seen too much; your mind can't understand it, causing your sight to become erratic and unreliable:
d10 | Short-Term Madness

    <text>The most lethal osteomantic power. You can cause the skeleton of a creature to liquefy in a matter of seconds, causing the body to collapse in on itself. Choose a creature within your reach; it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or die.
	A successful save prevents the death by skeletal collapse, but the creature still takes 10d6 necrotic damage. Creatures without bones and creatures whose CR or character level is equal to or higher than the caster's CR or character level are immune to this spell.
