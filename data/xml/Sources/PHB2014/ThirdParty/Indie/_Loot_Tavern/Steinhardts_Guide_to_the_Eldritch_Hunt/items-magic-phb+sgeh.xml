    <text>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical or magical weapons are susceptible to moongilded weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons, magical or not, with moongold.
	Moongold gives a 1d4 bonus to damage rolls against non-humanoid creatures. Moongold acts as a guiding light in the darkness; creatures holding or wearing moongold have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness.
	You can moongild a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 1000 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the moongold, but the time and expertise needed to add moongold to the weapon without making it less effective. Moongold loses its effectiveness over time; if a moongilded weapon has not been recoated in moongold after 3 months, the coating falls off, ending its effects. Recoating a weapon before it loses its moongilding costs 500 gp and refreshes the duration of the moongold.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

	Moongold gives a 1d4 bonus to damage rolls against non-humanoid creatures. Moongold acts as a guiding light in the darkness; creatures holding or wearing moongold have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness.
	You can moongild a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 1000 gp.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, handaxe

    <text>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical or magical weapons are susceptible to moongilded weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons, magical or not, with moongold.
	Moongold gives a 1d4 bonus to damage rolls against non-humanoid creatures. Moongold acts as a guiding light in the darkness; creatures holding or wearing moongold have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness.
	You can moongild a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 1000 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the moongold, but the time and expertise needed to add moongold to the weapon without making it less effective. Moongold loses its effectiveness over time; if a moongilded weapon has not been recoated in moongold after 3 months, the coating falls off, ending its effects. Recoating a weapon before it loses its moongilding costs 500 gp and refreshes the duration of the moongold.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

	Moongold gives a 1d4 bonus to damage rolls against non-humanoid creatures. Moongold acts as a guiding light in the darkness; creatures holding or wearing moongold have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness.
	You can moongild a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 1000 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the moongold, but the time and expertise needed to add moongold to the weapon without making it less effective. Moongold loses its effectiveness over time; if a moongilded weapon has not been recoated in moongold after 3 months, the coating falls off, ending its effects. Recoating a weapon before it loses its moongilding costs 500 gp and refreshes the duration of the moongold.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Proficiency: simple, spear
