    <description>Parasitic geists are defined by their unnerving appearance and insatiable appetite for living creatures. These once-living beings each met a particularly brutal end, often on nights of the hunt, and were cursed by the city to become voracious apparitions. They have become trapped in a never-ending cycle, feeding on the living in an attempt to regain some semblance of their former selves, but in vain.
	Parasitic geists lost their bodies along with their minds, resembling floating heads with long, writhing tendrils protruding from their ghostly faces. They use these tendrils as a means of feeding, breaking through the skin of unsuspecting victims and draining their life, guided by nothing more than a visceral hunger. The ethereal appearance of these walking corpses is hard to perceive with the naked eye, flickering in and out of existence, phasing through solid structures.
	These monsters are drawn to places where people are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain-grim banquets of blood and agony. Graveyards, battlegrounds, and other locations where death and violence prevail are where they are most often found.

    <description>These dread-filled monstrosities are the harbingers of the Scourge. Uncannily mirroring the appearance of scourgeborne, the fallen Luyarnhians are an abomination born of this dark corruption that began in the Ruby District. Sufficient instincts lingers within them to make them formidable adversaries for the unprepared. They clutch onto torches, a flicker of rationality trying to ward off the encroaching darkness. Yet, this act merely serves to cast long, monstrous shadows, turning the district into a nightmarish landscape.

Some fallen are bloated with bestial energy from their over-exposure to the Scourge. These fallen are distinguishable from others of their kind by their distended and swollen abdomen.

    <description>The corvian dwellers began appearing in the Ruby District, their warped form eerily similar to that of the scourgeborne, like fallen Luyarnhians. Their wings, heavy and matted with grime, are incapable of lifting them high enough to escape the district's confines—a blessing to others, else they'd carry their plague beyond the barricaded borders of the Ruby District.

    <description>Geists are two souls intertwined in a solemn dance of despair and suffering. Created by the will of a Great One, these souls ripped from fallen bodies now do their creator's bidding without judgment or rationale. While their appearance differs from typical ghosts, they too glide through the air with the same eerie motions as their undead brethren. Their form twists and changes, capable of resisting even the blows of magical weapons. Their existence is the reason why most hunters carry plain steel weapons as back up.

Dying Breed. When the moon was shattered, most geists broke along with it. This was the undeniable proof that the hunters had the powers to break and end the Scourge afflicting them. In Luyarnha, death offers no respite; a person's body and soul risk becoming the tortured pawns of vile masters, thus the denizens of the city show a fighting spirit rarely seen elsewhere.

    <description>Enhanced patients are victims of a macabre surgical practice designed to augment their latent psychic abilities. In an ungodly exchange, their natural sight is forever relinquished, alongside most of their intellect, instead replaced by the chilling cold of the Ocular Apparatus. This metal device, fused directly into the patient's eye socket, opens pathways to metaphysical visions beyond comprehension, linking the frail mortal consciousness with something far greater and more terrifying.
	These manipulated individuals, forever blinded to mortal sight, are left suspended in a perpetual state of ethereal revelation, their minds teetering on the brink of cosmic comprehension and madness, bestowing upon them a set of nascent psychic abilities. As living conduits to the cosmos, they form the crux of the Obitus Scholare's ongoing research—the price of their sanity, a small offering for the promise of cosmic enlightenment, holding the key to creating something far greater than meager jaegers.

    <description>Zealots are fanatical followers of the Radiant Church. The Church believes that the Radiant One holds the key to free Luyarnha of its scourge, just as he brought them enlightenment. As such, these zealots do their utmost to spread their message and gather converts. They know that actions speak far louder than words and as such are always at the forefront of each hunt. They are trained in the art of combat, but they prefer to use their abilities to heal and support their allies, strengthening the faith of their comrades through their unwavering devotion. They are often willing to make the ultimate sacrifice in the name of their deity, if it means saving their kin.
	Despite their peaceful demeanor, zealots are capable of incredible violence, driven by their faith to defend the Radiant Church and its followers. Although their doctrine is one of tolerance, direct insults to their god are deemed heretical and they will not hesitate to use their powers to quiet the offender. They are often seen leading Radiant Church expeditions, accompanied by a retinue of hunters, as they seek to bring the light back to Luyarnha after its fall from grace.

    <description>Cursed-bloods are brave beyond reason, beings willing to go to dangerous lengths to protect their family;
butchers are part of the many that have sacrificed more than their lives to defend their loved ones.

Lunar Rebirth. For a cursed-blood, removing their mask causes excruciating pain, akin to the agony of being scalped, before causing a horrific death. One dangerous way of acquiring power is for cursed-bloods to, as they approach the end of their life, perform such an act on a night where the Blood Moon is high. All die immediately, their hearts withering; but for a chosen few, a horrific rebirth is granted. Willful subjects to the twisted influence of the astral body, their flesh contorts and mutates in ways that defy the natural order; the lost twin embedded in their chest is resurrected, and its new eye opens to survey the world from within their abominable form. The transformation isn't without cost, as the cursed-blood's mind fractures and its memories fade away, leaving behind only a fierce bloodlust that compels them to slaughter the aberrant.

Eternal Hunt. Now consumed by eldritch power and stripped of their intellect, they are immune to the creeping tendrils of madness that would drive others to insanity. Before their rebirth is complete, an elder of the tribe bestows upon them a red cloth that covers their face, so that the actions from their new body may not tarnish the previous life they led. The newly birthed butcher soon begins their hunt, relentlessly cleaving the beasts that plague the city, though in their mindless zealotry, they often strike down even those that have yet to transform.

    <description>Lining Luyarnha's many churches, one can find silent sentinels of faith: the guardian gargoyles. These constructs, carved from the very stone that forms the walls and balconies of these hallowed places, are more than mere decoration. For the most part, the gargoyles remain as still and silent as the rocks from which they were wrought, standing sentinel over the sacred spaces they protect, their unblinking eyes ever watchful and their monstrous visages a stern warning to those who might dare to defile the sanctity of the church. However, when such sanctity is threatened or the lives of those within its walls are in peril, these seemingly inert creatures are roused to life. Animated with the divine words of the clergy, they move with a singular purpose: to defend the church and its congregation.
	As they spring into action, the stone forms of the gargoyles become supple and agile, their wings unfurling to reveal the full extent of their might, before swooping down upon their enemies with the wrath of the divine. Once their duty is complete, the guardian gargoyles return to their stone slumber, resuming their silent watch over the churches they were birthed to protect.

    <description>The motto of hunters is "survive together, or die together." They never hunt alone, unless they are forced to. After all, even the oft considered greatest hunter, Steinhardt, was always accompanied by Vicar Priscilla on all his hunts. The nights in Luyarnha can be brutal and the beasts relentless, and only a united front can hope to survive.
	All jaegers are hunters, but not all hunters are jaegers. Where jaegers are relentless killers, hunters are often simple citizens wishing to protect their homes and those they love. They are often the first to perish, but fear the one who lives long in a profession where men die young. Hunters are an invaluable contribution to the survival of the city-state and its denizens, and successful hunters cut down hundreds of beasts throughout their life before succumbing to the fires of battle.

    <description>When the hunts first began, they were kept under wraps, only to be executed under cover of the night. Hunters swore an oath of secrecy to the Radiant Church: none were to speak of the Scourge; rumors would spread more virulently than a plague ever could. But the hunters were warriors, not propagandists, and thus the Scions, hungry for favors from the top, offered their help with creating a means of removing any trace of the horrors that occurred each night.

Hunting dogs had been used for centuries in Luyarnha: for retrieving partridges, rounding up wild boar, and even as attack hounds by the city watch. However, all of these canines required a master, and all left the bones and inedible guts of their their prey festering in flycovered mounds. The Radiant Church needed an autonomous creature with fewer dietary scruples, one that would lick the cobbles clean of blood and decayed flesh alike.

Using the technology of manikin creation, the Scions fused flesh to metal, creating a construct-canine with an insatiable appetite: razorblade bitzers. Released in the wake of a hunter's pursuit, or after an eldritch incursion decimates a neighborhood, these bitzers consume all. Bones were broken, liquids lapped up, and the gaze of Luyarnhians is protected from the brutality of the events that transpired the night before.

Although the eldritch runes carved upon the steel of their skin ensures the loyalty of these hounds to the Church, many still roam the streets, forgotten and masterless. Only in death does their duty end.

    <description>With wings that stretch the breadth of a grown man and sharp blades that can rend flesh from bone, a dire fate awaits any who dare cross paths with this warped creature. It is a stalker unparalleled, a being consumed by the very essence of fear that seeks solace in the embrace of darkness. Fortuitously, the denizens of Luyarnha rarely glimpse this monstrosity, for its senses far surpass those of sane mortals, rendering it vulnerable to the raucous cacophony and blinding luminescence of the bustling city-state. Instead, it lurks within the shadowy depths of the forests surrounding the metropolis, biding its time.

Fallen Scourgeborne:
Once a mere vespertilio, this beast has been twisted by madness, its soul devoured by the very darkness it sought refuge within. The vestiges of its humanoid features have been distorted into a grotesque visage, its eyes aglow with a feral hunger as it stalks its quarry. Yet despite its monstrous appearance, the screechwings take to the skies with a grace that belies its savagery, its acute senses guiding it to its prey with lethal precision. Employing its ear-rending shriek, it deafens all who hear, leaving them disoriented and vulnerable to its relentless assault.

    <description>In the moonlit nights of Luyarnha, deformed humanoids loom, their monstrous forms stalking unsuspecting prey, abducting them as test subjects for their masters' heinous rituals and experiments. These wretched beings are called abductors-altered cursed-bloods bound in eternal servitude to the Obitus Scholare.
	Short and gaunt, shrouded in darkened robes, its mouth sewn shut, each abductor carries a candle, an enchanted light that burns its soul to cloak its twisted flesh in shadows. Despite their fragile appearance, abductors possess unparalleled strength, their power enough to subdue even skilled warriors. Rarely do they employ lethal force, preferring to incapacitate their targets before devouring them with the ravenous maw of their conjoined twin, tucking them safely within the confines of their abdomen before delivering them unto their new home.

    <description>On the outskirts of Luyarnha, there once stood a human village, soon to be engulfed by a cruel tragedy of fate, as their village was consumed by a catastrophic wave of corrosive acid, washing over their homes and extinguishing the lives within. The unbearable pain and despair that overtook them in their final moments cracked open the doors of their minds and souls, inviting a curse to take bed within.
	As their mortal forms were twisted and broken by the relentless onslaught of acid, the curse seized upon their anguish, warping their beings into monstrous shapes. In place of the stalwart villagers, there now stood grotesque, undead bears, their singed fur barely concealing the corroded skeletons beneath. The disfiguration they had suffered in their death persisted in these new forms, a macabre testament to the catastrophic demise that had befallen them.
	Now, these cursed beings lurk in the desolate acidic waters that swallowed their village, their anguished spirits consumed by the power that had claimed them. Driven by the lingering rage and despair of their human lives, these bears have become fearsome predators, their presence a warning for any intruder who dare venture into their forsaken homes.

    <description>Will-o'-the-wisps are capricious sprites that delight in misleading the unwary, guiding them from the security of trodden paths and into the perilous embrace of the wilderness. Yet, when forests brim with hatred, a strange phenomenon occurs. This collective animosity converges, taking form into a singular, more potent entity known as a wisp liege, an embodiment of the wisps' evil spirits. After the cataclysm of the First War, such monsters began to dwell within the forests surrounding Luyarnha. It was as if the dark magic unleashed in that conflict had infused the land itself, altering its essence.
	The wisp liege reigns over its lesser kin, its malevolent influence turning their harmless pranks into malefic acts. Under the liege's rule, the wisps' misdirections grow vicious and calculated. No longer are they merely content in leading travelers astray; they now revel in their ensuing demise, echoing the darkness within their sovereign.

    <description>Even though the Obitus's engineering of the jaegers was praised for its scientific brilliance, they quickly discovered that they needed more to slake their insatiable thirst for knowledge. They shifted their attention to canines after observing the amazing advancements the Scions had achieved in developing the Razorblade Bitzers. After all, why couldn't the flesh of mongrels be altered if that of humans, elves, and even manikins could?
	One of the few breeds with the strength to endure exposure to the primordial serum, the same serum which was used to awaken the powers of jaegers, is the Doberman Pinscher. However, like many of the earliest hunters, their bodies were incapable of handling the excess power, irrevocably mangling them.
	Rare are the ones that hunt alongside these 'reviled hounds. In fact, only those who have been trained to see past outward appearances can comprehend that these pups, despite their horrifying features, will remain devoted, even if it means their deaths.

    <description>Failed Experiments:
In their lust for power, the Obitus Scholare lead gruesome experiments, merging the flesh of soldiers with that of eldritch beings. Their labor gave birth to powerful combatants, and a sea of corpses. Scorched adjudicators are the fruits of such experiments, humanoids that couldn't become true warriors, failing to resist the call from beyond and losing their sanity. Yet, the scholars still found a use for these failures: they now act as perfect killers for their creators.

Enforcers of Justice:
Adjudicators enforce justice, more specifically, the brand of justice approved of by the Obitus Scholare. Indeed, these abominations are dispatched to remove any threat to the order, their otherworldly powers trapping the souls of their victims and ensuring an irreversible death. The murderous intent of these monsters is apparent in battle; they delight in causing suffering and their deadly instincts prevents healing. Deriving a twisted sense of pleasure from their hunts, adjudicators often carry the shrunken, decapitated heads of their victims as horrific mementos.

    <description>Lone Travelers:
From the day it manifests into existence, until the day it is laid to rest, an ales nebulae has but one purpose, to find its lifelong partner, and to protect it until death. It travels the vast cosmos in search of the one to fill the void within, erring through the stars, for centuries, often in vain. Its whole existence could be considered a cruel cosmic joke. Yet, it does not falter, and its search continues.

Vassals of Gravity:
Its mysterious birth in the cosmos grants an ales nebulae powerful, and sometimes uncontrollable, gravitational powers. The other-worldly bird is able to invert gravity for a brief moment and bend the fabric of reality to teleport around, yet it can't control the crushing field of gravity it emits, preventing all from approaching it. All, but the one it's life was destined for.

    <description>Dullahans owe their dreadful existence to the Circle of Symbiosis. When one of their own members dares to betray the sacred circle, they are condemned to the grim fate of becoming a dullahan. The transgressor is bound to an ancient stone altar, where, beneath the cold gaze of the moon, their head is severed in an act of macabre justice-yet life doesn't leave their body.

Relentless Huntsmen. Unleashed into the world as a headless harbinger, the newly created dullahan is then merged with an undying steed and tasked with a dark purpose: to hunt. Their prey vary—for some, innocent individuals to be kidnapped from their everyday lives, and others, adversaries of the Circle, marked for death. The Circle's knowledge of their targets is eerily accurate, and so, once the dullahan sets its sightless gaze upon a target, relenting isn't an option that exists.

Scorned by Radiance. The price of transmogrification into a dullahan is steep. The unholy essence that fueled their headless form etches an irreversible mark on their soul. Even when restored to their living state, they bear this cursed taint, which stands in stark opposition to the divine energies that brim in many places of worship. When a dullahan dares to breach the boundaries of these hallowed grounds, their bodies immediately ignite in a roaring blaze, punished by the radiant powers above.

Eternal Curse. Should the dullahan weather its gruesome task and pay off the debt of its soul, the Circle takes it upon themselves to decide the creature's destiny. Some are mercifully put to rest, their spectral existences snuffed out as abruptly as they began. Others, who've shown their penitence throughout their servitude, are deemed worthy of a second chance. These fortunate few are restored to their former state, reinstated as druids in the Circle, but forever marked by the scars of their ordeal.

    <description>These nightmarish entities, with an unsettling multitude of writhing limbs producing a continuous, disquieting clatter, are truly a sight to unhinge the mind. Even when seemingly at rest, their bodies appear to be in constant flux, ceaselessly shifting and pulsating in a grotesque dance of flesh and tendons, exuding a noxious miasma—a toxic byproduct of their repugnant feasts.

Nightmare Denizens. Mercifully, the city of Luyarnha has been spared direct contact with these abominations, confined as they are to nightmare realms, unable to breach into the Material Plane. They are grotesque echoes of the absurdity that infests the dreams of the dormant Great Ones. Nightmare centipedes have the ability to ensnare entire communities caught adrift in the nightmare realms, causing them to disappear without trace. Whether these lost souls are consumed or subjected to some other fate is a chilling unknown.

Hive Minds. A single nightmare centipede is sufficiently worrisome, but they become exponentially more dangerous when they gather, forming a collective consciousness. This hive mind amplifies their intellect and their lethality, coordinating their movements and strategies with terrifying efficiency.

Nightmare centipedes produce a subsonic chittering noise, a sound beyond the auditory capabilities of most species, that serves as a communication tool, and as something far viler. They can use this sound to exert control over creatures weaker than themselves, particularly insects and other many-legged beasts, compelling these underlings to enact their gruesome will. Their unfortunate victims can do little more than writhe in agony as a horde of spiders, ants, centipedes, and cockroaches swarm over them, burrowing into their flesh and consuming them from within.

    <description>Skulking shades-grotesque amalgamations of corporeal flesh and shadows—rarely dare to encroach upon the luminous Luyarnha, as if the city's radiance terrifies them. Yet, as the city teeters further and further into the abyss, these nefarious beings have begun to increasingly venture past its walls, particularly in the poorly defended Ruby District, drawn to the banquet of organs innocent mortals offer.

Muddled Origins. Chilling rumors whisper that skulking shades are the progeny of forgotten deities, unleashed upon this reality as punishment for the hubris of mortals who think they can ignore the gods, or even rival them. Other tales tell of these spectral beings as the vestiges of the ancient human empire, neighbors to Luyarnha long ago before its cataclysmic fall, now returning as harbingers of vengeance. Others posit that they are the restless spirits of warriors fallen during the wars, given form anew, eternally thirsting for blood. Whatever the truth may be, dark wielders of death's power have been known to call forth such skulking shades in battle, summoning them from the deepest shadows of this world.

      <text>The dreadcrow's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material or verbal components:

      <name>Illusory Horror</name>
      <text>Illusory Horror. The dreadcrow's appearance is an illusion, reflecting the worst tear of the observer. It gains a bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier while it isn't incapacitated.
	In addition, when a creature that can see the dreadcrow starts its turn within 30 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes at the start of its turn to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the dreadcrow until the start of the creature's next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the dreadcrow in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw. Creatures within 5 feet of the dreadcrow have advantage on this saving throw, as they partially see its true form.

    <description>Of all beings that relish in the terror they cause, dreadcrows are among the most foul, embodying the worst fears of those who behold them. A dreadcrow's body is illusory, constantly changing and shifting to reflect its victims' deepest fears. Yet it rarely relies on this, instead opting to lie in wait, slowly eroding the minds of those who are unfortunate enough to cross it, driving them to madness. Victims often lose their grip on reality-and life—long before laying their eyes on a dreadcrow. If approached too closely, dreadcrows will retreat in darkness, snuffing any chance of seeing their true form, before assaulting the mind of their prey and plunging them into a smothering abyss of terror.

    <description>Nightgaunts are nightmarish beings, in the truest sense of the word. Originating from the demented slumber of a Great One, they are its will made manifest. Uncouth black things with smooth, oily, whale-like skin, unpleasant horns that curved inward toward each other, bat wings whose beating made no sound, ugly prehensile claws, and tails that lashed needlessly and disquietingly. They never speak or laugh, and never smile because they have no faces at all to smile with, only a maddening blankness where a face ought to be.
	Nightgaunts are creatures that subsist on the raw emotions of their prey, lurking in the shadows as their victims writhe in the throes of vicious nightmares. They reveal themselves only when their hunger becomes unbearable, isolating unsuspecting individuals before tormenting them, releasing them only once they've had their fill. Nightgaunts don't take lives, nor inflict grievous physical wounds, unless attacked first. However, the mental scars they wreak are hard to heal, leaving many of their victims with bouts of insomnia and a fear of the dark that can last for a lifetime.

    <description>Before the Scourge, before even the First War, the hubris of wizards invited the eldritch powers to assert their will. These osteomancers, magicians who delve into the magic of bones, sought to enhance their own bodies-growing to the heights of giants, making armour of bony plates, and forming blades from calcified protrusions. Like moths to a flame, eldritch beings were drawn to these spellcasters and corrupted their magic, resulting in the malformed creatures known as cloistered maidens.

Sexual Dimorphism:
Over a few days, a period known as the Great Unchaining, all who practiced osteomancy lost control of their spells. All male osteomancers began dying, their bones growing in warped, fractal patterns and piercing their own organs. Their female counterparts fared even worse: borne by a flood of necromantic magic, their bodies grew into large, twisted creatures, vessels for the eldritch powers that overcame them.

Eternal Hunger:
These half-dead corpses feel nothing more than an insatiable hunger that drives them to devour anything alive. Indeed, reports of a cloistered maiden are often the first priority for hunters lest they turn entire neighbourhoods into corpse and bone. The Radiant Church, ever vocal in its disparagement of osteomancy, proclaims these maidens to be manifestations of the sin of gluttony, another instrument in the toolbox of propaganda they use to sway the populace.

    <description>Deep within the subterranean depths of the Asylum, a network of chambers houses a once-proud race of giants, now transformed into grotesque monstrosities through years of barbaric experimentation.

Prisoners of War. The First War saw Luyarnha pitted against its expansionist enemies, driving the city-state to abandon all moral principles in its quest for means to combat the rampant scourge that threatened its citizens. The early scholars of death, dogged in their determination, pressed forward with their grotesque experiments, and in their desperate pursuit of the perfect hunter, recognized the frailty of the humanoid body. They turned to capturing and subduing giants for their grim work-beings that could withstand more suffering before death.

Derelict Patients. To ensure the subjects' cooperation and restrict their movements during harrowing procedures, the giants were chained with bonds that burrowed deep into their very bones. Heavy armor was then affixed to their twisted forms, before injecting them with refined cerebro-spinal fluid extracted from Otherworldly beings, twisting their bodies and shattering their minds. Their usefulness was eventually outlived, as the scholars, now enlightened, resumed their experiments on humanoids. With the giants' blood now corrosive and their minds destroyed, they remain imprisoned in their bleak chambers, abandoned, condemned to pain and insanity until their eventual death, forgotten by all.

    <description>The Hollow Sentinels, an elite sect within the Grey Templars of the Radiant Order, were created to hunt not beasts but men—the osteomancers. These tireless inquisitors have undergone a gruesome transmutation, rendering them immune to the corrupting magic of these blasphemous wizards.
	In a secret rite known only in the highest echelons of the Grey Templars, the bones of these chosen few are meticulously removed and replaced with an advanced composite, bestowed by the Scions and transmuted into a divine element through days of fervent prayers and blessings. This miraculous metamorphosis imbues the Hollow Sentinels with unparalleled resilience, enabling them to ignore even the most potent osteomantic spells.
	The process of becoming a Hollow Sentinel is not without risk, and only the most devoted and resolute candidates are chosen to undergo the transformation. The loss of their innate skeletal framework is an excruciating ordeal; nevertheless, the Sentinels maintain that there is no nobler sacrifice than the ones they render in the name of their righteous duty. Albeit, the toll exacted for the attainment of such might is a remarkably slow recovery-borne from the partial loss of their humanity-oftentimes necessitating days to heal from a single mission, thereby constraining the church's capacity to deploy these invaluable combatants.

    <description>The jaegers of Luyarnha stand as the city's premier line of defense, a formidable force whose might singlehandedly turned the tides of battle in the First War. These warriors exhibit an unwavering commitment to their city, always the first to answer the call of duty and often the last thing their adversaries see. In their hands, the jaegers wield potent trick weapons gifted to them by the Church and other factions dedicated to the city's salvation. With these instruments of destruction, they can decimate entire squadrons of beasts and humanoids, nimbly evading attacks and relentlessly pursuing their quarries until their blades sink into their targets.
	The mysterious process of their creation is closely guarded by their creators, the enigmatic Obitus Scholare. With the ongoing city lockdown, however, the ranks of the jaegers have been gradually thinning. They fall in battle more rapidly than new jaegers can be forged. It is the hope of all citizens that Luyarnha can stem the tide of the Scourge before their mightiest shield shatters.
	Every jaeger's life revolves around a strict regimen of training and battle, honing their skills and reflexes beyond the potential of mere mortals: with each kill, they sharpen their instincts, bolstering their own strength and becoming harder to kill-an unfortunate truth that applies even to those of them who lose their sanity. Jaegers are the city's greatest hope and the embodiment of its deepest fear-the jaegers, ever the hunters, ever the hunted.

    <description>The inexplicable feeling of fear that grips the heart and wrenches the gut is not a rare occurrence in Luyarnha.
Most citizens blame that fear on the horrors that lurk in the streets at night, but some of the town's most deranged denizens accuse an unseen force: skeletal behemoths that lie in wait atop the spires of the city, and alongside its walls.

Silent Watchers:
Lunar revenants move unseen, their form only revealed by the light of the moon, dwelling in locales where the stench of death permeates the very air they breathe. Hence, it comes as no surprise that so many are drawn to Luyarnha and its murderous madness. These eerie creatures do not make a sound, even upon death, they simply vanish, leaving behind naught but a thin trail of ash, the sole memento of their existence.

Peaceful Brutality:
Although they never initiate a battle, once provoked, Lunar revenants become brutal engines of death, relentlessly attacking until their opponents lie shattered, before returning to their idle occupations, as if the fight was but a mere bad dream. Few hunters can testify to their ruthlessness, as few ever made it out alive. The first attack against a lunar revenant was ordered by the Radiant Church, in a misguided attempt to quell the tale of their existence. That night, dozens of hunters perished to bring down a single revenant, a sacrifice none were ready to pay. Thereafter, it was decided that these beings were best left well alone; after all, it is much easier to silence those who would spread rumors.

    <description>The advent of the First War brought forth unanticipated terrors from the southern reaches, among them were the roaring manes, elemental lions that can tunnel through earth and explode onto the battlefield with deafening roars that unnerve even the most seasoned warriors. The precise method employed by the southern armies to tame these fierce beasts remains a mystery, with captured soldiers cryptically alluding to sharing a bond of blood.
	These beasts, once capable of burrowing beneath the Luyarnha's primitive walls, never could penetrate stone nor steel. Ironically, the menace they once posed bolstered the city's defenses, providing employment opportunities for the cursed-bloods, who went on to strengthen not only the city walls but also the city's infrastructure. This construction effort thwarted roaring manes, the reinforced ramparts now more profound and impervious—a fortified blend that would serve to break their claws.
	In the era before ramparts and the Scions' mastery over lightning and thunder, roaring manes were a dreadful omen on the battlefield. However, today, with the resolution of the First War, the echoes of the roaring manes' destructive past have vanished and the few that remain are held in captivity, serving as amusement for the city's nobility in their combat arenas.

    <description>Creations of the Scions, blue-flame custodians are instrumental tools of the eldritch hunt, as their azure flames reveal even those who lurk beyond. Though their minds are engineered to be unbreakable, their swords often fail under the tremendous force of their blows. The cerulean fire that powers them is manufactured by exposing flames to Scionic lightning, a practice that some in their ranks call blasphemous.
	A custodian's sturdy body is used as a shield in the midst of battle, defending the intellectual and frail scientists that are the Scions—a shield that must be held separate from one's body. Indeed, some have tried to create armor from the body of custodians; all were immolated by the azure flames.
	In the aftermath of the first hunts, the production of blue-flame custodians came to a halt, as the rare metals required for their construction disappeared, along with entire trade routes, when Luyarnha was cut off from the world. Now, what remains of these living suits of armor is fiercely protected by the Scions, and their bodies are always sought after, should they fall in battle.

    <description>The cervus tenebris, spectral beings adorned with massive sets of ghostly wings, prowl the shadows in search of their next unsuspecting victim. Once humanoid, they were driven by an insatiable hunger so monstrous that they succumbed to the unthinkable act of cannibalism. In the throes of their grisly feast, they consumed their own bodies, an abomination that should have led to their demise. But the cosmos had other plans. Instead of meeting their end, they underwent a heinous transformation, becoming monstrous beings shrouded in shadows and damned to a never-ending existence of torment.

Only while it hunts does the gnawing pain that crucifies its body dulls-it lives in a constant state of agony. This torment it externalizes unto its victims, summoning shadows from the fallen to stalk and drain the life from its quarries, weakening them for an inevitable, gruesome death. The cervus tenebris hunts by consuming the flesh and shadows of the living, growing more formidable as it feasts upon the essence of its prey, its spectral wings expanding as it gorges itself upon the life of its victims.

    <description>The emergence of such a formidable monster as this breed of belua is a rare and dreaded event. Most beluas succumb to their curse and transform into lesser monstrosities, such as the Scourge Lycans, which though still dangerous, don't possess the same unfathomable savagery as their greater kin. However, should a particularly skilled hunter lose their grip on their own humanity, they may become a far greater menace to the city than any mere beast they had once vanquished.
	The devouring belua is a fearsome monstrosity birthed from the unbridled fury of an eponymous scourgeborne, a monster that bears witness to the brutal nature of their curse. Once half-beasts of lupine visage, with a tenuous hold on their souls, they are now consumed by the inferno of their own anger, and have surrendered entirely to their bestial essence, abandoning any semblance of morality. The devouring belua's lupine form has completely overtaken their humanoid shape; their once unblemished skin now a mangled tangle of coarse, matted hair; their muzzles elongated, filled with razor-sharp teeth that rend flesh with vicious ease; and their howls, harrowing echoes of their suffering, are now cacophonous cries that freeze the blood of those who hear them.
	Once turned, these monsters prowl the shadowed alleyways and desolate corners of Luyarnha, their blind anger robbing them of their sight, like a cruel poetry of fate. Relying solely on their heightened senses of hearing and smell to navigate the world around them, their blindness now only serves as a catalyst for their rage, ensuring that anyone—beast or huma—who crosses their path will be met with a storm of ferocity.
	It is whispered that devouring belua are capable of detecting the rage that lies dormant in the hearts of others, drawn to the turmoil that festers within. They prey upon these enraged souls, devouring the very essence of their anger, leaving behind a broken husk, devoid of fury or flesh, whilst feeding their own insatiable anger in vain.

The Owlbear has two tentacles and can only make a tentacle attack or grapple with tentacles that haven't been cut down.</text>

    <description>The owlbear, an eldritch abomination of feather, fur, and flesh, is a grotesque chimera that defies all reason and order. With the head of an owl, the body of a bear, and the scales of a serpent, it moves with an unnatural, fluid grace, as if its bones were made of rubber rather than calcium. Its matted fur is a patchwork of grays and browns, covered in a sickly sheen of slime and sweat, and its twisted tentacles are incapable of swimming, instead serving as a mockery of the octopus form.
	The neck of an owlbear is the most unsettling aspect of its monstrous form. Adorned with a swirling mass of fleshy fangs, its neck is a kaleidoscope of madness that seems to shift and writhe of its own accord. As an owlbear approaches, the stench of decay and corruption precedes it, filling the air with a noxious cloud of rot and filth. Its jaws, lined with razor-sharp teeth, click and snap with a rhythmic hunger that speaks of its insatiable appetite for flesh. Its claws, long and curved like sickles, are stained with the blood of countless victims, and its very presence seems to warp reality around it, plunging the world into a nightmare of darkness and chaos where light will be snuffed out.

    <description>Librarian Kristoffs Journal Entry #32 - The Penitent

This plane does not birth them, yet they feast on the limbs of its denizens. Could they be aberrations born from the Scourge's corruption upon our citizenry? I find it improbable, given their uniform golden masks - an oddity unlikely from simple mutation. Perhaps remnants of church weaponry of the First War?
	That too seems a stretch. The sacred tomes affixed to their sides bear no resemblance to any religious texts I have encountered. An important piece of the puzzle that deepens the mystery surrounding them.
	One particularly unsettling observation - they possess a capability akin to 'reproduction.' Yet, instead of a natural birthing process, they seem to corrupt other beings into their likeness, each new convert subsequently donning a similar golden mask.
	They abhor sunlight and shun noise, fleeing from both like beasts before a flame. This would explain why they rarely appear above the surface. My studies lead me to speculate on the existence of an overarching hive mind, a singular consciousness puppeteering these drones.

    <description>A chimeric creation of beasts and bones, galvanized prowlers were once the epitome of Scion technology, a defensive bastion against the Scourge's onslaught. Corrupted by the eldritch components from which they were crafted, they slaughtered their masters and joined the ranks of those they once hunted.

Storm Hunter. Leaping between rooftops, galvaznied prowlers are as avid storm chasers as they are predators; they revel in the refreshing tickle of a lightning strike on their skin and use a tempest's rolling thunder as cover to mask the sound of their pursuit. The howl of a prowler is distinctive, an ear-scrambling cacophony of taut wire scraping over rusted bones. To hear such a noise is a clear warning to remain indoors, with doors barred and windows shuttered, lest it is death you seek.

Origin. In their efforts to build an arsenal of creatures with which to defend Luyarnha, the Scions explored the magic of chimerification. With threads of tin, these scientists stitched components harvested from eldritch corpses to the bodies of criminals and, with a burst of lightning, fused the rotting mass into a weak-willed and easily manipulable creature. But their weak will and eldritch blood made them susceptible to the influence of the Great Ones, who soon found new foot soldiers to add to their chaotic horde.

    <description>In the forlorn Luyarnha, where clerics and hunters hold sway, magic capable of resurrecting the fallen is often called "The Call of Death." For those who have journeyed beyond the veil of mortality and dare return, an irremovable stain is left on their soul, beckoning their demise — "Death".
	A monster that stalks those who have eluded the clutches of the grave, a creature whose sole purpose is to snuff out the lives of those who have defied their fate, Death's reputation is such that its mere mention is enough to send shivers down the spines of those afflicted.
	No one knows for certain where Death came from or why it was unleashed upon the world, but its presence is a grim reminder of the fragility of life. Yet there are those who seek to defy this fate, who cling to life with a desperate fervor, willing to pay any price to cheat its relentless march, those who would think themselves above their kin, but to Death, their life has the same worth as that of a beggar's-two gold coins, which shall cover their eyes until it finds its next prey.

    <description>"Our Slumbering Father that lies dormant, may you discover our worthless world; may you sink it beneath your waves; may you grant us a glimpse of your grandeur; guide us home."

Should a bold soul dare to infiltrate the submerged chapels of the Deep Ones, they would soon discover an unsettling truth. The figures that ornament the watery halls are no statues at all; they are in fact shards of the Slumbering One's power, poised to imbue the world with the incomprehensible gifts of their otherworldly patron.
	Conjured through the arcane rituals of the Deep Ones, the Dreamer's Minor Avatars are embodiments of their master, made manifest within submerged sanctuaries. Resembling inert statues, these entities endow the Slumbering One's devout followers with minute portions of the power they ardently seek. These avatars are devoid of thought and emotion, their purpose inscrutable, yet their link to the Slumbering One is undeniable. Meaningless specks of dust erring through the cosmos, devoid of the grandeur of their progenitor, one must wonder if their father is even aware of the existence of such worthless and pathetic effigies.

Roll those dice, and increase the aranea's current hit points and hit point maximum by the total. For every four Hit Dice the aranea gains in this way, its attacks deal an extra 3 (1d6) damage on a hit. The aranea retains these benefits for 7 days.

    <description>A soul-snatching aranea is a scourgeborne that has succumbed to its curse. When alive, it was a master of duplicity and lies, a more formidable deceiver than the rest of its kin, navigating the world through a web of manipulation. In a twist of fate, its madness revealed the monstrous personality beneath and gave it a more fitting form. Now truly accursed, this horror continues to use its skills to prey on the living.
	These massive arachnids find refuge in the abandoned buildings of Luyarnha, turning them into their feeding ground. The aranea weaves illusions aimed at the unsuspecting, luring them in with sounds and visions of their closest loved ones. Rumors claim that it can imitate the sound of any person, past or present, with chilling accuracy. Once it has lured its victim close, it reveals its true form—a giant arachnid monstrosity of legs and fangs, a head dangling upside down, adorned with multiple eyes that gleam with a dark, sinister light—before leaping and devouring its prey's soul, leaving only the shell of a body behind.

One of the many reasons why "regular" araneas are despised is because of their soul-snatching cousins.

    <description>Ectellax, The Flayed was just an eldritch wyrmling when the God-Shaped Hole sent him to the Templum Praeteritum as a test for the mortal priests there. He was the last of the tests before the "Radiant One" vanished. Unlike the other eldritch sacrifices, Ectellax defeated the priests in the temple by directly tapping into the God-Shaped Hole's power through the original eldritch carving. The exposure to this raw energy tore the flesh from his body, flaying him alive and leaving him in a constant state of agony.

Tempestuous Growth.
As the Radiant Church retreated and sealed the horrors away, Ectellax devoured the eldritch energy and grew faster than he would have otherwise. Now an adult, the dragon has gained a semblance of control over his enormous potential, and is ready to break through the sealed door leading to the Radiant Church and waits, desperate for his opportunity-even the monstrous gravitational fields he generates are useless against this eldritch prison.

Inherited Dreams.
Those of his kin share a collective memory that each newborn inherits—a gift of memory through flesh. Yet, the only thing that Ectellax has added to this wealth of knowledge is his despair. In his slumber, the memories of his ancestors possess him, tormenting him, rousing his anger and frustration, feelings that he is unable to act on. The visions of dragons soaring through the cosmos, bending foreign civilizations under their rule, or wiping them out of existence with their apocalyptic powers-sources of pride for his kind, and a painful reminder of his own helplessness.

Helpless Tyrant.
Trapped underground and cut off from the world, Ectellax's mind has slowly unraveled. He has long lost the ability to distinguish between reality and dream; sometimes believing himself free, he hurls himself against the walls of his stone prison. The earth trembles and stone groans as the dragon thrashes about in his sleep, shaking the surface world in the crossfire of his nightmare. The proud being is now nothing more than a trapped and tormented soul. Ectellax's long imprisonment has twisted his despotic intentions even further, turning them into a thirst for destruction and revenge. He longs to break free and unleash his fury on the world and the heavens, dethroning the so-called god that turned him into a puppet; but these remain hopeless wishes, as the barriers holding him underground remain unyielding.

Eldritch Summoning. The child-god summons 1d4+2 geists (Page 313) or 1d2+1 wraiths to fight for it. These creatures act on their own initiative and disappear when the child-god is defeated or when they reach 0 hit points.

Warped Reality. The child-god warps the fabric of reality in a 20-foot radius centered on a point it can see within 60 feet. The area becomes difficult terrain, and any creature that starts its turn in the area or enters it for the first time on its turn must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

Cosmic Wave. All creatures must succeed on a DC 22 Charisma saving throw or be displaced throughout the arena. The child-god chooses a point on the ground where they reappear. On a success, a creature isn't displaced. If it succeeds by 5 or more, the target can choose to teleport to a point that it can see instead.</text>

	• When the Goat Mother's Avatar appears, the Blood Moon of Rebirth appears in the sky, and remains there until the avatar vanishes or dies.

	• Trees within 6 miles of the lair grow taller and denser than usual, turning nearby forests into labyrinth-like wood. Creatures that enter the woods must make a DC 15 Survival check every hour to avoid getting lost.

	• Aberrations, beasts, and monstrosities within 6 miles of the lair have their forms shifted. Their eyes turn into goat eyes, their skin or fur darkens, and they gain a climbing speed equal to their walking speed.

	• Aberrations, beasts, monstrosities, and humanoids that engage in intercourse within 6 miles of the lair are blessed by the Goat Mother's fertility, immediately becoming pregnant if they have the necessary reproductive organs. Pregnancies within 6 miles of the lair progress as much in one hour as they would in a day, and whenever a humanoid is born within 6 miles of the lair, the GM rolls a d20. On a 10 or lower, the humanoid becomes an accursed tiefling, a beast, or a monstrosity.

If the Goat Mother's Avatar dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but the other effects fade over 1d2 days. Creatures that are born accursed remain so for the rest of their lives.</text>

    <description>When the Blood Moon of Rebirth descends upon the world, it can deliver a corporeal sliver of the entity that imbues it with potency, an immature and frail embodiment of its vast cosmic might. Yet, the power of mortals is so insignificant that even this fragile shard of the Goat Mother's energy can force the world to capitulate beneath its young.
	Whispers tell of such an avatar manifesting once in the kingdom of men. The collective might of their army proved insufficient, as the pathetic Thousand Youngs laid the realm to waste. Her existence was fleeting, dissipating alongside the moon, her inscrutable purpose fading with it. No such avatar has been witnessed since, the world likely so insignificant—a mere speck in the grand cosmic expanse—to catch a fragment of the Great One's attention.
	Yet the question lingers-what might transpire as the world ventures perilously closer to otherworldly forces far beyond understanding? Ignorance is indeed bliss, and those who dare to pry too close to the truth face unsettling revelations. As mortals dabble in these eldritch arts, one can't help but fear the return of the pathetic avatar, or worse.

"One can only wonder if the catastrophic annihilation wrought by this caprine being was a mere demonstration of power, a warning to those of us who meddle with forces beyond their comprehension. Though I posit that such a statement would be giving us far too much importance, and simple happenstance unleashed the apocalypse humans faced, happenstance yet again allowed it not to ravage the rest of our world. Woe betide the foolhardy souls who seek to harness these cosmic powers, for the consequences of such hubris could be disastrous.
	So, we stand at the precipice, looking into the abyss, heedless of the fact that the abyss is also looking back at us, waiting, ready to swallow us whole."
- Founder of the School of Eldritch Tongue, at the Obitus' assembly

    <description>The term "Fallen Hunter" refers to those hunters who, tragically, have fallen prey to the scourge that afflicts Luyarnha. They represent the unfortunate reality of the struggles faced by those who dedicate their lives to hunting the monstrous and the vile.
	Importantly, it's worth noting that, while these scourge-claimed hunters are numerous, they are not all simultaneously active, or even alive, within Luyarnha. If they were, the city would have crumbled long ago. The Fallen Hunters detailed in this book are specifically designed to serve as named antagonists - potential villains who can add depth and challenge to a campaign. The stronger the original hunter, the stronger the transformed form.
	However, despite their fearsome nature, the Fallen Hunters present an interesting divergence from many of the adversaries heroes may face. They hold the hope for redemption. This concept of potential redemption is key in defining their role in the world of Luyarnha. It offers unique storytelling opportunities, and it can shape narrative arcs in a campaign in compelling ways.
	Such redemption might take the form of a miraculous recovery driven by the heroes, restoring them to their former self, free from the scourge's insidious grasp. Alternatively, it might present itself as an opportunity for a Fallen Hunter to engage in one final act of defiance against the dark forces corrupting Luyarnha—or in the case of those who haven't completely lost their sanity, the opportunity to give them a new goal and a new hope to fight once more. In either case, these narrative paths allow for Fallen Hunters to be more than just adversaries; they can be tragic figures, symbols of resilience, and catalysts for emotionally charged moments.

The Veiled Hunter:
Once a simple woodsman and hunter who lived a quiet life in Jägerweiler Village, Brayden Lilyguard was chosen by the Obitus Scholare as one of the first to undergo their eldritch experiments. After being infused with the dead cerebro-spinal fluid of an eldritch entity (see "Part Three: The Eldritch Temple," page 443), he gained inhuman strength, speed, and the ability to tap into the natural world of the forest he loved so dearly. But as time went on, he and his fellow huntsman began to change. They began hearing dark whispers in their minds that eventually became a cacophony of terrifying screams. Their bodies morphed and changed into feral creatures.
	Brayden fared better than his comrades in retaining most of his sanity, but couldn't stop the change into the specter-like being he had become. In the church's attempt to wipe them out with a flood of acid, he died. Years later, under the sky of a Blood Moon of Rebirth he was brought back, a mask adorning his face. he gathered the mutated "survivors" and rebuilt the village into what it is today. As the Veiled Hunter, his only passion is for the survival of his remaining people and the utter destruction of those he holds responsible.
	More information on the Veiled Hunter can be read in the Vile Village adventure. (Page 429)

    <description>In the Luminary Repository rests the lifeless form of the Defiled Librarian, formerly an esteemed researcher of arcane secrets and revered advisor to the hunters. Drawn to forbidden lore, the scholar succumbed to an all-consuming fixation with an unfathomable being he referred to as "The Midnights of Rotting Creation."

Burning Ambitions:
Aware of his insignificance within the vast cosmos, the faithless researcher longed to commune with the enigmatic entity, yearning to ascend and attain a power beyond his mortal flesh. His pride made him blind to his weakness before the vastness of the cosmos, and he clung to the belief that immense sacrifices would reveal the path. Driven to the edge of madness, the scholar enacted a heinous rite, setting an entire orphanage ablaze to fuel his dark incantations.
	At last, an entity granted a response: a single, powerful word that tore asunder the scholar's mortal frame. His human flesh was rent apart, transformed into the terrifying specter known as the Defiled Librarian, forever imprisoned among the arcane tomes, his mind rising to higher planes, or so he believed.

Agonizing Ruler:
In this realm, where minutes stretch into years, the Librarian's consciousness endures tortures born of osteomancy—an eternity of bone spines burrowing into his flesh and ravenous maws devouring his heart, only to regenerate anew. This 'higher' realm is naught but a place of torment and terror where the Librarian exists as both master and prisoner. The being has since learned to control the sinister magic that haunts him, his spectral figure trapped betwixt life and death. Conversely, within the confines of his scholarly lair, the Librarian's dead physical form lies, its remains ravaged by the passage of time. His eyes, however, continue to possess an unsettling vigilance, observing every movement, inexorably drawing the hapless souls that unwittingly stumble upon his moribund husk into his dread dominion. These unfortunates serve as both nourishment and specimens for the Librarian, their flesh dissected for sustenance and dark inquiry—a research dedicated to crafting macabre instruments that one day shall free him from this forceful exile.
	The true visage of the Scholar has not been glimpsed by mortal eyes since that fateful day of unspeakable transgression, but rumors of spectral whispers within the halls of the Luminary Repository circulate, though few are foolish enough to inquire further.

    <description>There exists a circle of druids known as the Circle of Symbiosis, whose devotees of the natural world sought to unite themselves with it in the most literal sense, utilizing the forbidden art of osteomancy to replace their own limbs with those of the creatures and plants that surrounded them. The resulting "awakened symbiotic entities" are beings that transcend the confines of their mortal forms, becoming monstrous amalgamations that defies the very laws of nature they revere.

The Chosen One:
It was within this circle that a child named Tisiphone came into being, her fate irrevocably intertwined with the abhorrent rituals that marked the Circle of Symbiosis. From a tender age, she was subjected to the cruel and agonizing rites that would transform her into a living instrument of the Circle's insidious will. As she grew, the line between her humanity and the monstrous grafts that adorned her body blurred, until she could no longer recognize herself as the child she once was.
	Tisiphone's motivations were shaped by the dark teachings of her parents and their subservience to the circle, which instilled in her a fervent desire to make all living beings one with nature, by any means necessary. No sacrifice was too great for the cause, and her unwavering devotion drove her to inflict upon others the same torment that she herself had endured. Her origins as a child of the circle had bestowed upon her a terrifying affinity for her rampaging powers, and as she aged, her humanity waned, giving way to something far more relentless and unforgiving.

Child of the Greater Good:
Her drive was fueled by the knowledge that the circle's practices had earned them the scorn and revulsion of the civilized world, a fact that only served to strengthen her resolve. Undeterred by the ostracism they faced, Tisiphone and her fellow druids continued to recruit—or abduct—more individuals to join their cause, swelling the ranks of their twisted order and spreading their influence ever further.
	Yet, for all her monstrous power and unyielding determination, Tisiphone was not without her weaknesses. The very grafts that granted her strength were also her greatest vulnerability, a reminder of the humanity she had sacrificed for the sake of her family's vision. As her body became more and more indistinguishable from the creatures and roots that constituted her grafts, the last vestiges of her former self struggled to maintain their hold upon her soul, a fact further exacerbated by the truth-seeking orb —the will of the circle made manifest— orbiting her since her ascension, the sentient relic constantly whispering in her mind.

While paralyzed in this way, a creature automatically fails its saving throws against Malach's Deadly Miasma.
	If at or below 81 hit points, Malach uses his golden form to release a glimmer of sickening light. Each non-construct creature within 120 feet of Malach must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 18 (4d8) radiant damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. This ignores immunity to the poisoned condition. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>

    <description>Once a manikin, forged like countless others by the hands of the Scions, Malach found itself twisted and warped by its loathing for the races of flesh. Donning a macabre suit crafted from the very skin of those it had slain, Malach's mechanical form lay concealed beneath this grisly mantle. Its form is that of a blasphemous angel, its wings composed not of feathers but of a multitude of hands and heads, each reaching and grasping, desperate souls trying to flee this prison of flesh. The face of this monstrous being, rent asunder in some long-forgotten conflict, now unveils its original visage of exquisite gold.

Mechanized Malevolence:
The metamorphosis into this grotesque perversion of an angel transpired gradually, as Malach sought to augment its own form by sewing the dismembered remains of its vanquished foes upon itself. Ever more powerful it grew, until at last it brimmed with the arcane power it sought, leeched from the grafted limbs of its enemies. No madness plagued Malach, but rather its own psychotic mind, driven to eradicate the very beings that had spawned its wretched, empty existence. It harbored a seething hatred for the frailty of flesh, for where flesh falters, metal endures, and Malach had endured enough. Consumed by a maelstrom of destruction, it seeks to bring about the annihilation of those born of flesh.

Malice Unbound:
The origins of Malach's revulsion toward flesh are uncertain. Perhaps it had been spurned by humans and elves, abused and mocked by them; perhaps it bore the mark of a flaw in its creation; or in complete opposition to that theory, perhaps Malach was the perfect construct, imbued with both soul and sentience, its spirit wracked with torment as it witnessed the silent suffering of its fellow manikins.
	Its weapon of choice, a censer, exudes a pestilential miasma that suffocates and poisons those formed of flesh—a fitting tool for one who bears such deepseated hatred towards the living. For each manikin that falls to Luyarnha's bloodthirsty madness, Malach shall rend twice as many mortal souls.
	In its zealous mission, Malach emerges as ally or foe, depending on the beholder's intent. To those who made the mistake of being born of flesh, it is an implacable adversary, its censer an omen of retribution. Yet, to those who stand beside Malach in its quest to topple the reign of flesh, it serves as a monstrous champion, one who shall not waver from its fell mission.

    <description>Vicar Priscilla was a fearless warrior and a beloved and revered member of the Radiant Church. Despite her frailty, she was devoted to her faith and among the first to join the ranks of the hunters. Her efforts, were not in vain, as she fought beast after beast, decimating their ranks and rescuing Luyarnha from the depths of the abyss.
	Yet during the 33rd Hunt, when all thought that the scourge was over, she found herself facing creatures from beyond the realms of human understanding. A malice so vile that it curled up her spine, this evil was the convergence of the void, the infinite expanse beyond what lies dormant. She had never experienced anything like the horrific struggle that took place. Though she repelled the entity, it was no victory; all who survived that night were left on the brink of despair. Her spirit had been broken, her loved ones had been slaughtered, and her insignificance had been laid bare before her.
	A shattered moon rose that night.
	She vowed not to allow such atrocities be in vain, pouring months of research alongside scholars of the Church, attempting to pierce the creature's secret. From the mound of flesh that she hacked from the being, and the maddened knowledge she gained, Priscilla fashioned a sword of pure moonlight—a blade that could alter fate.
	Priscilla blazed a new path through the plague-filled streets with renewed zeal, strengthening her hunters with her enhanced arcane powers. Nonetheless, she suffered defeat once more.
	She was abandoned on the pavement, her coven shattered. That night she vanished. It is believed that her broken body was restored, and that she now spends her days in her chambers in quiet reflection, seeking guidance from a higher power. Covertly, there are hunters who claim they still see her during gruesome hunts, leading forces to victory with her shard of moonlight in hand.

    <description>Abaddon—a fighter rescued from death by being grafted an eldritch parasite and becoming a living nightmare—bore witness to dreadful carnage that sparked his profound loathing towards osteomancers, the malevolent arcanists who callously slaughtered his comrades in arms. Intent on exacting vengeance, he bravely embarked on the path to become a Hollow Sentinel. However, his intrinsic otherworldly shard violently revolted during the transmutation process, warping him into an unrecognizable monstrosity driven by fury and insanity.
	Despite his transformed state, his hatred remains a constant, now generalized to all wielders of magic, regardless of their intentions. His abhorrence extends beyond the individuals to the very concept of the arcane, blaming it for the world's misery. Proficient in the deadly art of the hunt from his former life, Abaddon employs his skills ruthlessly against practitioners of magic. His hunts are no longer mere revenge missions, but have grown into a personal crusade against magic itself. Some spellcasters have taken drastic measures to avoid his wrath, renouncing their powers and severing their ties to the arcane.
	There are those who whisper that the Radiant Church still holds some sway over this rampaging monstrosity, using his threat as a strategic card in their negotiations with arcane masters. Skeptics, however, opine that his madness is too far gone for any semblance of control to exist. Whether a puppet of the Church or an independent agent of chaos, one thing is agreed upon-being in the path of his monstrous fury is a fate best avoided.

    <description>Martyr Tulio, hailed as the 'Radiant Watcher,' was a hunter of incomparable resolve, waging a ceaseless battle for the safety of his people, aided by the ethereal luminance of his blade. However, this sword concealed a monstrous sentience within, which would gradually gnaw away at Tulio's psyche, leading him away from the radiance of his path.

Light's End. One fateful night, when the Creeping Tarlight arose, the glow of Tulio's blade was extinguished for good, swallowed by madness. Tulio was reborn, a servant to his now forever darkened weapon. He who had always preached salvation, now saw his own vanish.

Dark Radiance. While there are accounts by witnesses observing his emergence from the tar, it is speculated that, in the throes of his madness, a vestige of his once righteous spirit pierced through. Driven by this last shred of his humanity, Tulio disappeared to a place where he would not inflict pain upon those he held dear. Another conjecture is that he may have maintained more of his former self than was first thought, permitting the illusion of benevolence to dissolve once he had accumulated the power he sought, and he has now retreated to scheme grander plans.

The truth remains unclear. However, whispers of his actions—both valorous and terrible-still echo through the city. Many of the good deeds this man did were unpunished, and many still owe him their life.

Some claim to have seen a dark figure on the fringes of the city, a specter wreathed in the same tar that once consumed the Radiant Watcher. I believe these are just fanciful tales of those who wish to keep the memory of Tulio alive.

    <description>There once lived a noble and valiant paladin named Gerhard. A guardian of the people and a symbol of hope, he fought tirelessly to protect the city from the countless dangers that threatened its existence. Revered by the townsfolk, he stood as a bastion of light amid the encroaching darkness.
	However, fate had other plans for Gerhard. On one of his many quests, he stumbled upon a cursed artifact of great and terrible power. In his bravado, he unleashed the curse upon himself, and the darkness within the artifact began to seep into his very being. His once-pure soul was tainted, and his body began to twist and warp into a monstrous, unrecognizable form.
	As Gerhard's transformation grew more pronounced, he realized that the curse was beyond his control. Unable to bear the thought of harming the people he had sworn to protect, he made the ultimate sacrifice.
	Gerhard implored his companions to banish him, to bind him in chains and cast him into an unfathomable abyss from whence he could never escape. In a final act of love for the city he had served so faithfully, Gerhard surrendered himself to a fate worse than death.
	His comrades, their hearts heavy with sorrow, reluctantly agreed to carry out his wish. They bound the tortured knight in enchanted chains, forged with the power to contain even the most potent of dark forces. With a solemn oath to honor his memory and uphold his legacy, they consigned Gerhard to the depths of the abyss, where his monstrous form would be forever hidden from the world.
	And so, Gerhard's tragic tale came to an end —or so it seemed. Deep within the abyss, Gerhard has now entirely succumbed to the curse. His mind, once sharp and filled with purpose, has been obliterated, leaving behind only the instincts of a ravenous beast. The remnants of his once-noble spirit are lost, devoured by the darkness that has consumed him entirely. His selfless act saved the city of Luyarnha from the devastation he might have unleashed, but at a terrible cost to himself.
	The reason his comrades chose banishment over granting him the release of death was the fear that the curse would spread upon his demise. They believed that if Gerhard were to die, the dark power would be unleashed, seeking new hosts to corrupt and destroy. Thus, they condemned their friend to an eternity of suffering, bearing the weight of the curse alone, to ensure the safety of Luyarnha and the world beyond. And so, the tale of Gerhard, the once-proud knight, now a monstrous beast in the depths of the abyss, remains a somber legend, talked about only among those who still remember his name.

None shall slay him, and he shall only know suffering.

    <description>As the scorching moon rises, beasts become restless, cobbles crack, and the air sizzles with savage suspense. Fiery claws cauterise as they rend, and Luyarnha is choked with the scent of charred flesh.

    <description>Kaspar is a former hunter of the Radiant Order who retired when he got older and slower. He hung up his sword and now works as a painter. Beneath a gruff exterior, Kaspar is kind-hearted, but he has become suspicious and withdrawn due to past traumas. His milky white hair and sun-darkened skin testify to his years in the field. He's willing to help the party defend themselves if they prove they're willing to stand up against the horde.

Hunter:
The motto of hunters is "survive together, or die together." They never hunt alone, unless they are forced to. After all, even the oft considered greatest hunter, Steinhardt, was always accompanied by Vicar Priscilla on all his hunts. The nights in Luyarnha can be brutal and the beasts relentless, and only a united front can hope to survive.
	All jaegers are hunters, but not all hunters are jaegers. Where jaegers are relentless killers, hunters are often simple citizens wishing to protect their homes and those they love. They are often the first to perish, but fear the one who lives long in a profession where men die young. Hunters are an invaluable contribution to the survival of the city-state and its denizens, and successful hunters cut down hundreds of beasts throughout their life before succumbing to the fires of battle.

    <description>Father Hauke is a middle-aged man with a tall and thin build. He has a gaunt face and deep-set eyes that betray his weariness. He is dressed in the traditional robes of his faith, adorned with intricate golden embroidery. Father Hauke speaks with a strong and confident voice, but his eyes reveal a hint of doubt and uncertainty. He is a priest of the Radiant Church and a man of faith who has recently grown doubtful in the face of how bad Geistnacht has turned out. As much as he wants to believe all will be well, he can't help but feel the night is only worsening. Despite his doubts, he is determined to do the right thing and protect his congregation.

Zealot:
Zealots are fanatical followers of the Radiant Church. The Church believes that the Radiant One holds the key to free Luyarnha of its scourge, just as he brought them enlightenment. As such, these zealots do their utmost to spread their message and gather converts. They know that actions speak far louder than words and as such are always at the forefront of each hunt. They are trained in the art of combat, but they prefer to use their abilities to heal and support their allies, strengthening the faith of their comrades through their unwavering devotion. They are often willing to make the ultimate sacrifice in the name of their deity, if it means saving their kin.
	Despite their peaceful demeanor, zealots are capable of incredible violence, driven by their faith to defend the Radiant Church and its followers. Although their doctrine is one of tolerance, direct insults to their god are deemed heretical and they will not hesitate to use their powers to quiet the offender. They are often seen leading Radiant Church expeditions, accompanied by a retinue of hunters, as they seek to bring the light back to Luyarnha after its fall from grace.

    <description>Maddon is a pale-skinned young orc with slicked-back dark brown hair and a crooked smile that he often uses to show off his gold-capped canine tooth. The rogue has worked for Lord Thomathin Rehwoldt for many years as a go-between for the noble and the city's more criminal elements. While his dark clothing helps him blend in with the shadows, his vanity and wealth are on full display in the form of gold trinkets that he often casually flashes.
	The shady orc has a policy of always looking out for himself first, but the current situation in the city has him concerned. To protect his business interests, he provides assistance to the characters wherever and whenever possible.

Spy:
Rulers, nobles, merchants, guildmasters, and other wealthy individuals use spies to gain the upper hand in a world of cutthroat politics. A spy is trained to secretly gather information. Loyal spies would rather die than divulge information that could compromise them or their employers.

    <description>Lord Thomathin Rehwoldt is a narcissist that values reputation and power above all else. It does not matter to him how the plague affects the city, only that the church has blamed him. It's apparent that Thomathin is not necessarily a good person, but he is true to his word and keeps his promises to friends and rivals. He is honestly unaware of the research the sect was conducting and is eager to accuse the Radiant Church simply out of retaliation for implicating him. Thomathin doesn't care who is blamed for the plague, that the beasts are infected citizens, or if the church is even truly guilty; repairing his reputation and power are all that matter to him.

Noble:
Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.
	The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.

    <description>Borast is an experienced monster hunter who specializes in eldritch creatures and supernatural events. He has leathery nutmeg skin, and his jet-black beard and hair are braided with silver wire. A creature's claw left three scars across his right cheek and eye. The gruff and suspicious dwarf prefers to work alone and is unhappy that Lord Rehwoldt hired the characters. However, he begrudgingly admits that his currently incapacitated state precludes him from completing the mission and helps the party in whatever way he can.

Jaeger:
The jaegers of Luyarnha stand as the city's premier line of defense, a formidable force whose might singlehandedly turned the tides of battle in the First War. These warriors exhibit an unwavering commitment to their city, always the first to answer the call of duty and often the last thing their adversaries see. In their hands, the jaegers wield potent trick weapons gifted to them by the Church and other factions dedicated to the city's salvation. With these instruments of destruction, they can decimate entire squadrons of beasts and humanoids, nimbly evading attacks and relentlessly pursuing their quarries until their blades sink into their targets.
	The mysterious process of their creation is closely guarded by their creators, the enigmatic Obitus Scholare. With the ongoing city lockdown, however, the ranks of the jaegers have been gradually thinning. They fall in battle more rapidly than new jaegers can be forged. It is the hope of all citizens that Luyarnha can stem the tide of the Scourge before their mightiest shield shatters.
	Every jaeger's life revolves around a strict regimen of training and battle, honing their skills and reflexes beyond the potential of mere mortals: with each kill, they sharpen their instincts, bolstering their own strength and becoming harder to kill-an unfortunate truth that applies even to those of them who lose their sanity. Jaegers are the city's greatest hope and the embodiment of its deepest fear-the jaegers, ever the hunters, ever the hunted.

    <description>Vicar Henri Inonder is outwardly a good and righteous man who works tirelessly to give succor to the poor and needy. His perfect smile, warm brown eyes, and perfectly groomed appearance hide a bottomless pit of greed and corruption. Henri is a member of the Obitus Scholare, the secret sect that was harvesting the eldritch being's remains. His twin brother, Vargas Inonder, was transformed into the augmented assassin that devolved into madness. After the sect's destruction and himself being injured, Henri now works to conceal the truth behind accusations aimed at the aristocracy and Lord Thomathin in particular because of an old grudge between them. He feverishly works to find a cure before succumbing to the madness like his brother.
	The Vicar is a master manipulator who is proficient in Deception and Persuasion. He hides his festering injury and resulting beast-like transformation behind an alter self spell while working to find a cure for himself. A successful DC 25 Arcana check or detect magic spell indicates the Vicar is using magic to alter his appearance. If dispelled, it reveals that he is almost entirely mutated into one of the bestial creatures.

Priest:
Priests bring the teachings of their gods to the common folk. They are the spiritual leaders of temples and shrines and often hold positions of influence in their communities. Evil priests might work openly under a tyrant, or they might be the leaders of religious sects hidden in the shadows of good society, overseeing depraved rites. A priest typically has one or more acolytes to help with religious ceremonies and other sacred duties.

    <description>Failed Experiments:
In their lust for power, the Obitus Scholare lead gruesome experiments, merging the flesh of soldiers with that of eldritch beings. Their labor gave birth to powerful combatants, and a sea of corpses. Scorched adjudicators are the fruits of such experiments, humanoids that couldn't become true warriors, failing to resist the call from beyond and losing their sanity. Yet, the scholars still found a use for these failures: they now act as perfect killers for their creators.

Enforcers of Justice:
Adjudicators enforce justice, more specifically, the brand of justice approved of by the Obitus Scholare. Indeed, these abominations are dispatched to remove any threat to the order, their otherworldly powers trapping the souls of their victims and ensuring an irreversible death. The murderous intent of these monsters is apparent in battle; they delight in causing suffering and their deadly instincts prevents healing. Deriving a twisted sense of pleasure from their hunts, adjudicators often carry the shrunken, decapitated heads of their victims as horrific mementos.

    <description>Lord Jasper Roth is a successful nobleman from a minor house in Luyarnha. He is widely known for his philanthropic efforts and support of the Radiant Church, particularly in medicinal treatments. Lord Jasper hires the party to find alchemist Klaus von Brunheimer, who lives in Jägerweiler, a nearby village that has recently gone silent. In particular, he was funding Klaus's research into various tonics and remedies that might help alleviate the current pandemic sweeping the city. Since the nobleman paid for Klaus' research and he is no longer in contact, Lord Jasper wants the party to retrieve it for him. He stresses the need for professional discretion, offering a generous sum of 1,500 gp up front, and promises 3,000 gp when the party returns with the research.

Noble:
Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.
	The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.

    <description>Lieutenant Captain Adelle Roux (LG human knight) is a Luyarnhian loyalist dedicated to protecting its citizens. She is a stocky woman in her mid-thirties with tawny brown skin and a square face framed by short, ravenblack hair. Respected among the guards as a fair leader, Adelle works hard to maintain that reputation and is willing to work with the party as long as they do not threaten the city or its people. She is protective of her nephew Bram, but feels he needs to see the outside world a bit and sees the characters as an opportunity for him to get dirt under his nails for once.
	The guard commander knows little about what is happening in the village below, but that little is enough to make her wonder and worry, especially with the increase in monster attacks coming from outside the gates. She agrees to let the party come and go, with the stipulation that Bram goes with them as a witness to their actions, and they give him a little advice about adventuring. If the party refuses to bring Bram with them, they must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince Adelle to let them leave alone; she refuses to let them leave through the gates without him. This check can be made with advantage if the characters mention they are under contract by the Radiant Church. A failed check results in the characters being forced to get creative with how they leave the city. For example, they might hire smugglers with access to a secret tunnel or cross over the wall when the guards are distracted.

Knight:
Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and noble causes. A knight's alignment determines the extent to which a pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and hirelings who are commoners.

    <description>Bram LeGrand is a quiet young man in his early twenties with a slight stammer and a nervous tick in his left eye. He spends most of his days cloistered with research books and studying the teachings of the Radiant Church. His aunt, Lieutenant Captain Adelle Roux of the city watch, stepped in after his mother (Adelle's sister) passed away years ago and has been looking out for him ever since. He respects his aunt, but feels smothered at times.
	Bram stays out of harm's way as much as possible in combat, assisting where he can. As an observer and trainee, he has limited capabilities and often makes poor decisions that put his life in danger.

    <description>The term "Fallen Hunter" refers to those hunters who, tragically, have fallen prey to the scourge that afflicts Luyarnha. They represent the unfortunate reality of the struggles faced by those who dedicate their lives to hunting the monstrous and the vile.
	Importantly, it's worth noting that, while these scourge-claimed hunters are numerous, they are not all simultaneously active, or even alive, within Luyarnha. If they were, the city would have crumbled long ago. The Fallen Hunters detailed in this book are specifically designed to serve as named antagonists - potential villains who can add depth and challenge to a campaign. The stronger the original hunter, the stronger the transformed form.
	However, despite their fearsome nature, the Fallen Hunters present an interesting divergence from many of the adversaries heroes may face. They hold the hope for redemption. This concept of potential redemption is key in defining their role in the world of Luyarnha. It offers unique storytelling opportunities, and it can shape narrative arcs in a campaign in compelling ways.
	Such redemption might take the form of a miraculous recovery driven by the heroes, restoring them to their former self, free from the scourge's insidious grasp. Alternatively, it might present itself as an opportunity for a Fallen Hunter to engage in one final act of defiance against the dark forces corrupting Luyarnha—or in the case of those who haven't completely lost their sanity, the opportunity to give them a new goal and a new hope to fight once more. In either case, these narrative paths allow for Fallen Hunters to be more than just adversaries; they can be tragic figures, symbols of resilience, and catalysts for emotionally charged moments.

The Veiled Hunter:
Once a simple woodsman and hunter who lived a quiet life in Jägerweiler Village, Brayden Lilyguard was chosen by the Obitus Scholare as one of the first to undergo their eldritch experiments. After being infused with the dead cerebro-spinal fluid of an eldritch entity (see "Part Three: The Eldritch Temple," page 443), he gained inhuman strength, speed, and the ability to tap into the natural world of the forest he loved so dearly. But as time went on, he and his fellow huntsman began to change. They began hearing dark whispers in their minds that eventually became a cacophony of terrifying screams. Their bodies morphed and changed into feral creatures.
	Brayden fared better than his comrades in retaining most of his sanity, but couldn't stop the change into the specter-like being he had become. In the church's attempt to wipe them out with a flood of acid, he died. Years later, under the sky of a Blood Moon of Rebirth he was brought back, a mask adorning his face. he gathered the mutated "survivors" and rebuilt the village into what it is today. As the Veiled Hunter, his only passion is for the survival of his remaining people and the utter destruction of those he holds responsible.
	More information on the Veiled Hunter can be read in the Vile Village adventure. (Page 429)

Roleplaying the Veiled Hunter:
As intelligent as he is insane, the Veiled Hunter is far more dangerous than the lesser beasts and creatures within the village. The shadowy figure feeds on the fear his presence inspires in others, and prefers to toy with his prey when possible. He is well aware that his current appearance is another weapon in his arsenal, and he uses it to full effect. It is impossible to keep a conversation going while his barking laughter interrupts his own arguments with himself on how to kill and eat them, and the whole time, his head and body twist at impossible angles with disjointed limbs.
	The Veiled Hunter appears as a putrid mockery of his former self, with rancid flesh peeking through the rents in his cloak and peeling around the bone mask that holds his face together. Thick stitching from the forced introduction of eldritch flesh into his body has created a tableau of scars, and the rot around them became a breeding ground for maggots. Their constant wriggling gives his decomposing skin the appearance of always being in flux. His favorite tactic is to grapple an opponent, expel these maggots onto their face, and laugh at their gagging screams.

    <description>Cerwyn Raolet is an older man in his late sixties with tight leather skin covered in liver spots. His body has been mutated and twisted into unnatural angles from exposure to the eldritch powers mingling with his blood. A bitter and curmudgeonly person who prefers the company of books over people, Cerwyn was a recluse who specialized in combining alchemy with the arcane. The Obitus Scholare sought him out for this expertise, and used him to flood Jägerweiler with alchemical acid to kill their failed experiments and witnesses. Afterward, they attempted to kill the angry mage, but he managed to escape. He's now hiding in these ruins and plotting revenge against those who tricked and wronged him. The mad mage lacks empathy towards life and sees what he did to Jägerweiler Village as nothing more than experimentation in the name of progress. He has no qualms about murder if it furthers his research.

Mage:
Mages spend their lives in the study and practice of magic. Good-aligned mages offer counsel to nobles and others in power, while evil mages dwell in isolated sites to perform unspeakable experiments without interference.
