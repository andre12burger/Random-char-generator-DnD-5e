    <description>The leader of the seven adventurers is an eager paladin. Brock is bold and courageous but still rather young. He began adventuring when he was a teenager. Brock obeys the laws of the kingdom and is the epitome of a loyal companion.

Inquisitive Warrior. His greatest quality is his endless enthusiasm and curiosity. Brock wants to explore the world and learn about places he's never seen before. He prefers to lead from the front and does not back down from a challenge.

Humble Beginnings. The young man grew up on a farm, far away from the bustling city of Wyld. His family is closeknit and they're hoping he'll return soon. His simple upbringing helps to keep him grounded. He doesn't trust merchants and won't believe a word they say.

Chivalry is Still Alive. Brock will do anything to protect a damsel in distress. He is a romantic at heart and believes in true love.

    <description>The annoying bard was last in line as his party crept through the dungeon. He heard an odd sound behind him. The elf troubadour turned to see a floating wizard's hat push its way into the chamber and fly towards him.

Heads Up. Some wizards use enchanted hats to protect their property. Other mages might even wear the odd construct. The hats appear to be quite ordinary and usually surprise their victims.

Mission Accepted. Wizards enchant the hats to force their victims to do certain tasks. Some hats force the wearer to leave the dungeon, other hats make their victims attack their companions. Every hat has a unique mission.

Constructed Nature. The hat doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Some enchanted dungeons have been taken over by powerful, spellcasting dragons. An arcane dragon will move into the former lair of a formidable mage and never leave. It is thoroughly evil and merciless. It doesn't trust good dragons, believing that real dragons are evil. There are many differently-colored arcane dragons, but they are usually blue or purple.

Magical Might. These dragons are skilled spellcasters with magic that can rival most wizards. They can also shapechange into humanoids or beasts and slip into local settlements.

Patient Predator. With incredibly long lifespans, these creatures are in no rush. At times, they diligently plot for years before making a move. Most arcane dragons also enlist powerful minions to serve them.

Hefty Hoard. Legends say that arcane dragons have larger hoards than any other kind of dragon. They protect their hoard by any means, including making deals with humanoids.

    <description>The head of the Wizard Council rules the free city of Nox, also known as the city of Magic. Archmage Ignatius of Nox is one of the most influential mages on the continent of Myrr. He's a good man, but his age is catching up to him. Ignatius has become rather absent minded and gets lost in thought. He is very independent and marches to his own drummer.
      
Wizards Rule. Nox is a magocracy and the council has the ultimate say in everything. They even have their own soldiers, known as the Mage Guard.

Perpetual Pandemonium. The city is a chaotic environment, because the Wizard Council doesn't concern itself with many day-to-day events. It is by far the most diverse city on the continent with elves, dwarves, and halflings mixing with humans.
      
Magic Carpet Ride. The archmage often travels on a magical carpet of flying, which can be shrunk to fit in his pocket. His familiar is a stubborn, golden owl named Xaggy.

The first sign of this creature is a bizarre string of nonsense words in the dark. It speaks Ancient Deep Speech from distant planes. The monster also emits an odd, musty smell.

Talkative Terror. These aberrations never stop talking and create chaos wherever they go. They babble incoherently, as few creatures can understand its forgotten language.

One-Sided Conversation. Blabberblubs are not interested in listening. They won't make any attempt to understand what other creatures are saying or doing. The aberrations simply want their next meal and are just thinking out loud.

    <description>After descending a set of stone stairs, the heroes spot a large, black cauldron. Without warning a red liquid begins bubbling inside. Then the boiling liquid sprays the shocked onlookers.

Hot Pot. These constructs blend into the dungeon environment quite easily. They spend most of their time sitting as still as a statue. When they activate, a liquid begins to boil inside. The cauldron heats up quickly to a dangerously hot temperature.

Constructed Nature. The cauldron doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
