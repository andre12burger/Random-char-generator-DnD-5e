        <name>Mage Hand Magus</name>
        <text>Manipulates a pair of mage hands to fight at range with levitating weapons.

Blades sweeping around in dramatic arcs, propelled by ghostly, disembodied hands— the Mage Hand Magi are truly a force to be reckoned with. While wizards are content to use mage hand to retrieve their wands and open doors from across the room, the cantrip's potential has always been clear for warriors: a deft mage hand can afford dozens of feet between a soldier and their foe, letting them deal a killing blow without raising a fingertip. Mage Hand Magi have mastered this cantrip through practice and discipline, elaborating a trick pioneered by warmages into a deadly fighting style of twin hovering blades. The most skilled can even manifest a warhand, a grand fist of magical wrath with which to crush their enemies.

        <text>Starting at 3rd level, when you choose this archetype, you learn the mage hand cantrip if you did not know it before. You can cast it with the following improvements:

	• You can cast and control mage hand as a bonus action.

	• You summon two separate hands when you cast it, and you can control one or both of them when you use the spell.

	• The spell's duration is indefinite, ending only when you are knocked unconscious or you choose to end it.

	• Your mage hands are stronger than normal, capable of lifting a combined weight in pounds equal to 5 x your fighter level, and they are dexterous enough to perform any ability check you could normally perform with your hands.

	When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one or more of your attacks through your mage hands against targets you can see within their reach. You can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls. A mage hand not wielding a weapon can be used to punch a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 1d6 force damage on a hit.

        <name>Martial Archetype: Bone Knight (HB)</name>
        <text>Manipulates their skeleton to sprout weapons and armor of bone.

A bone knight, or an osteoth, is a warrior that has undergone an agonizing transmutation ritual, granting them the ability to fully control their bones. While this power is plainly disfiguring, it allows them to grow bone protrusions for weapons and armor, changing their skeleton's size and shape at will. Mastering this ability is a feat of endurance and creativity, resulting in a fighter whose most powerful weapon is not sheathed at their side, but sheathed within their flesh.
	Many fighters believe the osteoth ritual is a mere myth, a flight of fancy traded around campfires. And yet, the process is indeed real, preserved among moldering tomes and in the minds of deranged wizards. With some resourcefulness, the procedure can be replicated with the contents of any alchemist's lab, with a generous fatality rate of nearly half.

You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.
	Additionally, when you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can use your reaction to shield yourself from harm. Expend a Hit Die, roll it, and decrease the damage taken by the number rolled.

Brawlers use their bare fists and raw force as their first and best weapons in combat. Such warriors come from tough stock-prize fighters, outlanders, bouncers, and veterans—and have learned to hone their bodies into implements of war. Wherever a brawler goes, bruised and broken bodies follow. It doesn't matter whether they're tossing thugs around a tavern or going toe-to-toe with a red dragon, brute force always comes out on top.

Feared frontline warriors bearing lances and unique, streamlined armor, Celestial Lancers are famous for their Meteor Jump, a supernatural technique taught only to the rare few.

This technique, combined with a suite of mystical powers drawn from the yawning sky, makes the lancers decisive warriors in the arena of vertical combat. Though Celestial Lancers may be hampered in claustrophobic dungeons, they excel underneath the open sky, where they can leap high and come crashing down for devastating impacts.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Martial Archetype: Dungeoneer (HB)</name>
        <text>A veteran of dungeon survival that knows every trick in the book.

Only fools would dive headfirst into an abandoned crypt filled with monsters and deathtraps, but it seems only fools emerge from such crypts laden with as much loot as they can carry. The archetypal dungeon delver is a veteran of such suicidal dungeon delves, and has become intimately familiar with the hazards therein. In the course of their adventures, such a dungeoneer will have adopted countless best practices, along with a litany of unproven superstitions which they believe keeps them alive. Principles from "always be the first one to hit the monster" to "never be the first one to touch a treasure chest" line a dungeoneer's journal. However, it's probably better to be paranoid and superstitious than lying at the bottom of a pit trap, incinerated by a fireball, or digested by a mimic.

        <name>Kick In the Door (Dungeoneer (HB))</name>
        <text>Also at 3rd level, you know how to charge through each chamber of a dungeon and come out alive. You have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, when you are not surprised and you initiate combat by kicking down a door, diving in from overhead, crashing through a window, or any other suitably reckless tactic (as adjudicated by the GM), you have advantage on attacks against creatures you can see during the first round of combat.
