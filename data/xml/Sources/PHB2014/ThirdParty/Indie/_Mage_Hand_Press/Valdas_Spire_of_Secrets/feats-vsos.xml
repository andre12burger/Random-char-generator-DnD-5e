    <text>Intensive training and combat experience have allowed you to master special combat maneuvers. You gain the following benefits:

	• You gain one battle die, which is a d6. This die is added to any battle dice you have from another source. A battle die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended battle dice when you finish a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative.

	• You learn two maneuvers of your choice from among those available to the Captain class or those available to the Grey Watchman subclass of the warden class. You use your battle dice to fuel these maneuvers. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

    <prerequisite>Spellcasting feature from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard class</prerequisite>
    <text>Instead of preparing spells normally, you fix each spell slot precisely in your mind, in the manner of wizards long past. When you would prepare spells when you finish a long rest, you record which spell you will use with each of your spell slots, picking from among the spells you could cast using it. These spell slots can't be expended for any purpose other than casting their assigned spells, but can be recovered and used to cast any spell. Additionally, you gain a bonus spell slot of each level for which you have spell slots, to which you don't assign a particular spell and can cast normally.
	For example, a 3rd level wizard has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level spell slots. Using this feat, the wizard must assign each spell slot to a spell; for example, three 1st-level magic missiles, one 1st-level sleep, one 2nd-level scorching ray, and one 2nd-level mirror image. The wizard also has one bonus 1st-level spell slot and one bonus 2nd-level spell slot, through which they can cast any spell they have recorded in their spellbook.

Perhaps dungeon delving has been on your bucket list for decades, and you never got around to it, or perhaps you're an mercenary that has been taking contracts for longer than your contemporaries have been alive and you have no plans to stop now.

2 | You've learned several trades in your life. You gain proficiency in two sets of artisan's tools of your choice.
3 | Your priorities have become crystal clear. You can always add your proficiency bonus to saving throws against being charmed.

Drawback:
d3 | Drawback
1 | You have a bad back. Your lifting and carrying capacity is halved.
2 | You have become forgetful. When you roll a 13 on the d20 for an Intelligence check, treat the d20 roll as a 1.

Your actual condition might range from total blindness to varying types of low vision, which grants you the following traits:

	• You have the blinded condition. However, attack rolls don't have advantage against you due to this condition.

	• You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

	• You can cast spells that require you to see a target or area, provided that the target or part of the area is within 30 feet, you have a direct line of sight to the target or area, and you can hear the target if it is a creature. If the target or area is further than 30 feet from you, you can make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, you cast the spell normally. On a failure, the spell fails and its spell slot is wasted.

	• You are immune to spells and effects, such as a medusa's Petrifying Gaze, that require you to see.

If your visual impairment is ever remedied, such as through the use of a regenerate spell, you lose the benefits of this feat. The GM should discuss with you whether or not removing your impairment is appropriate for your character-it is always a possibility, but never a requirement.

Because of this, you possess the following traits:

	• You rely on some sort of aid to stand and move. This can include, but is not limited to, crutches, a wheelchair or similar wheeled contraption, or a mechanical or magical apparatus that helps support your weight. Work with the GM to decide which sort of aid works best in the campaign world.

	• You can't take the Dash action on difficult terrain.

    <text>You were born as a pair of soul twins, identical twins that share a single soul and act as an extension of one another. These twins function as a single character with two bodies, which you control.

Actions. Your twins share a single action, bonus action, and reaction between them, each of which can be taken only once by one of the twins on your turn. If you take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Ready, or Search actions, both twins perform the action and gain its benefits.

Attacks. If you take the attack Action to attack with one twin, the other twin can attack as a bonus action. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you're able to make multiple attacks, you can divide these attacks between the twins.

Hit Points. Soul twins have separate hit points, which are divided between them. At 1st level, each twin has the hit points of a character of the same class. At higher levels, each soul twin's hit point maximum increases by your Constitution modifier + half a roll of the class's Hit Die (rounded up). If you use the average value instead of rolling the Hit Die, each twin gains 2 for a do class, 3 for a d8 class, 3 for a d10 class, 4 for a d12 class.
	When you spend Hit Dice following a short rest, you must spend the dice separately on each twin.

Spellcasting. A pair of soul twins can only concentrate on one spell at a time. However, only one of the twins needs to concentrate on a spell to maintain it. When you cast a spell which requires concentration, you choose which twin is concentrating on it.
	When casting a spell, either twin can provide the spell components, and the spell can originate from the twin of your choice.

Magical Effects. If a spell or magical ability affects one soul twin, it affects them both, unless that spell or ability affects hit points, or if the two twins are further than 100 feet apart. In either case, it affects each twin separately.

Conditions. A condition, such as being poisoned or grappled, affects only one twin, even if imposed by a spell.

Death. When a soul twin is reduced to 0 hit points and begins to make death saving throws, the other twin becomes incapacitated and its speed is halved. If a soul twin dies, the other twin quickly begins to deteriorate, and perishes 24 hours later if their partner doesn't return to life.

Empathic Link. As long as both twins are on the same plane, they can empathetically sense the other's emotional state. Each twin knows when the other takes damage.

Soul Twins:
The Soul Twins feat is an advanced option that shouldn't be taken by new players or those that routinely control other creatures, such as captains and necromancers. If it is unclear how a spell or effect would affect the soul twins, the GM adjudicates the outcome. A good rule of thumb is that if it heals, harms, or grabs a twin, it affects only one; if it charms, curses, enchants, or protects a twin, it affects both.

    <name>Starter Feat: Survivor (HB)</name>
    <text>In ways few can compare, you have seen the ferocity of battle, the wickedness of people, or the cruel coldness of the world. Your experiences have marked you with aching traumas and invaluable lessons of survival, granting the following traits:

	• You lose proficiency in one saving throw of your choice.

	• When you fall to 0 hit points and begin to make death saving throws, you must fail 5 saving throws to die.

    <name>Starter Feat: Traveler (HB)</name>
    <text>You hail from a place so far distant that you may never see home again. Perhaps you are lost in the planes of existence, displaced in time, or shunted to a strange new reality. Perhaps your true home merely lies on the other side of the vast ocean. Regardless, you know very little of this land, its history, or its people, and they also know very little of you. This results in the following traits:

	• You have disadvantage on Intelligence (History) checks pertaining to this new land's history or customs.

	• You can communicate simple ideas to any creature that understands at least one language using universal gestures and some creativity.

    <name>Starter Feat: Undead (HB)</name>
    <text>You are caught in the limbo of undeath, being neither dead nor truly alive. You may be a conventional type of Undead creature, like a revenant returned to life for vengeance or a lich that has bound their soul to a phylactery, or you might be something unique, the result of a curse or a freak magical accident. Regardless, you now walk the mortal realm with the following traits:

	• You do not need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe. You must still spend 8 hours doing light activity, such as keeping watch in order to gain the benefits of a long rest.

	• You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the poisoned condition on yourself, and you have resistance against poison damage.

	• Though your type is Humanoid, spells and effects which specifically affect Undead affect you as well.

    <name>Starter Feat: Upper Limb Disability (HB)</name>
    <text>Due to injury, illness, or incident of birth, you are unable to use your arms as others can. The cause might include partial paralysis, amputation of the arm or hand (congenital or acquired), lack of manual dexterity, arthritis, chronic pain, or a host of other factors.
	Even if you are missing an arm or hand, you can still engage in two-weapon fighting or wield a sword and shield at the same time through the use of prosthetics or a mechanical or magical apparatus that helps you grasp and hold objects.
	The nature of your limb disability might vary, so you gain one of the following traits of your choice, as appropriate to your disability:

	• You have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons and Strength checks that require use of your hands.

	• You have disadvantage on attack rolls with finesse and ranged weapons, and Dexterity checks that require use of your hands.

However, your learned resourcefulness knows no bounds. You have advantage on weapon attacks you prepare with the Ready action.
	If your limb disability is ever remedied, such as through the use of a regenerate spell, you lose the benefits of this feat. The GM should discuss with you whether or not removing your disability is appropriate for your character—it is always a possibility, but never a requirement.
