—Carlo Collodi, Le Avventure di Pinocchio

Ever a joy to children, geppettin resemble living playthings made of wood, cloth, or porcelain. Though easily mistaken for puppets, geppettin aren't manipulated by a just-out-of-sight puppeteer; they are animated, sentient, and independent.

Bisque geppettin are a form of porcelain doll, crafted with exacting specification and luxurious clothing materials. Though they are designed to look as realistic as possible, they are certainly the most terrifying of geppettin due to their lifeless visage. Though their faces are often very fragile, their construction is generally much hardier than their brethren's.

      <text>As a race, the geppettin are an oddity.

	Physically, geppettin are often shorter than halflings. Their physical features vary greatly from type to type, but they are almost always humanoid in shape. For simplicity, geppettin are classified by their materials: bisque are porcelain, marionettes are wood, and plushies are made of fabric.
	Despite being made of somewhat flimsy materials, sentience grants them an odd hardiness.
	Additionally, due to their non-living nature, they never hunger, rarely tire, and are adept at being innocuous. Most find some form of work or profession in entertainment, but a few find fantastic success as spies and assassins.</text>

Marionette geppettin are made mostly out of wood, with painted faces and carved clothing. Due to their construction, their jointed limbs are quite flexible, and they are known to be fantastic dancers. The very largest marionettes, called mannequins, stand as tall as a human and bear completely blank, expressionless faces.

      <text>"It was an ancient thing of moss-covered wood which creaked like a greatoak as it breathed, but I'll never forget its eyes: those glowing points were a thing of the fey, a thing of the deep woods forgotten to man."
—Faizon the Blue, encountering a mandrake

Laymen believe that mandrakes are wailing babies grown from the roots of a plant. However, such mandrakes are those which are harvested too early; literally children still in infancy. If allowed to grow for a year and a day before being harvested, mandrakes can mature into great and powerful tree people.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Flesh from Wood</name>
      <text>With a skin of thick bark and leaves growing at their extremities, you could be forgiven for believing that mandrakes are simply bizarre plants, treants, or animated trees. This might even be partially true: it seems that while mandrakes originated from some plant ancestor, they have become something midway between animal and plant through strange magic or stranger evolution.
	Mandrake anatomies are filled with paradoxes. They bleed a ruby ichor, reminiscent of both blood and sap. Their hearts, which look like a knot of roots, pump this around their body, enriching it with oxygen borne by leaves and special pores on their extremities. By preference, mandrakes can bask in the sunlight or consume living things for nourishment, and can even absorb nutrients through their feet, though they rarely subsist by sunlight and water alone.</text>

      <name>Forest Envoys</name>
      <text>Alchemists and arcanists alike scratch their heads at mandrakes, but druids know them as the green emissaries who stand between the realms of animals and plants, making peace for all parties. To druidic tradition, mandrakes are unique, ancient constructions of Mother Nature herself, intended to act as delegates for her will. Mandrakes are credited by old druids for aligning elves with the forests and dwarves with the mountains; only with the rising tide of humanoids and their preponderance of gods did most creatures forget about Mother Nature and her half-plant ambassadors.
	Today, mandrakes are rare, and make their homes in the forests near where villages and cities meet the true wilds. Humans tell tales of mandrakes savaging those who enter their domain, but druids and those who respect the old traditions of the forest know that such ire is seldom undeserved.</text>

      <text>Though the tiny, big-eared mousefolk are often overlooked by larger creatures, history is rife with stories of gallant mouse-knights staring down dragons, crossing blades with warlords, and charging into grand battles. It happens that few mousefolk aspire to heroism, but a certain moral compass often compels mousefolk to a higher cause.
	As a rule, mousefolk are good to their neighbors and rarely pick fights; after all, most people can be reasoned with. Those who can't be reasoned with, however, should rightly fear mousefolk striking at their knees. Mousefolk don't suffer bullies lightly.
	Despite their valorous legacies, no histories are written about the mousefolk culture itself. This i s because the mousefolk language, Rodentia, has no written form, and mousefolk preserve thier history in stories and songs passed from elders to children throughout the generations.</text>

You can't chew through materials that are harder than your teeth, such as metal, stone, or crystal.</text>

      <text>"Hers was a kind of unearthly beauty that resisted the very confines of reality-hair so airy that it flowed in defiance of gravity, skin so fair that it could be seen through."
—Jethro Meddlitt, gnome wizard, meeting a spirithost

Spirithosts are the eerie, spectral residents of the Border Ethereal. Though often confused for ghosts, spirithosts are very much alive-as much as their shifting, partly material bodies allow.

      <name>Ethereal Progeny</name>
      <text>The Ethereal Plane is rightly believed to be the domain of restless, transient souls. However, the Border Ethereal, which lies closer to the Material Plane, has its fair share of adopted inhabitants, such as the blink dog and phase spider. Spirithosts are the only humanoids to have adpoted this plane, and might be considered its only true descendents.
	Though their bodies resemble that of ghostsslightly translucent and glowing with a pale, white light-spirithosts are not undead. Far from it: they are born, grow old, die, and can even raise children. Yet the stigma of undeath lingers over them. Many a well-meaning but ignorant cleric or paladin has tried to turn or banish a spirithost to no avail. To avoid such conflict, spirithosts often avoid large, unfamiliar towns, or disguise their ethereality from others.
	Spirithosts do not experience time in the same way as most mortal creatures. As a result, even though they mature in their teens, their lives can stretch on for hundreds of years.</text>

      <text>Humans are known for being ambitious, diverse, and extremely short-lived, but also have the dubious honor of having an abundance of near-human offshoots, for it seems humans can breed with just about anything. Near-humans are still basically humans, bearing subtly different traits from a wide variety of sources, and are individually rare but make up a surprisingly large portion of any human population.
	Near-humans come in all shapes and sizes and from all walks of life. They are the barest expression of human diversity: human offshoots from all corners of the world.

According to legend, a human can achieve immortality by replacing their heart with a mote of celestial radiance. The secret to immortality, including the elixirs and rituals needed to achieve it, is protected by a small, clandestine sect of immortal mystics, each of whom only know one component of the process. There are perhaps only a dozen true immortals in the world, but as many as hundreds if every tale can be believed.

One of your parents was a human and the other was a dwarf. Such a pairing is unlikely to have produced offspring, but you have defied the odds to join the ranks of the sturdy and resilient muls.

You are a porterling, parented both by a human and either a gnome or a halfling. You stand about as tall as a dwarf, but are far leaner—and if fathered by a gnome, also somewhat top-heavy. Though they are often confused for dwarves, porterlings can only rarely grow large or thick beards.

Most humans possess some dull psionic potential, but those that unlock their psionic spark transcend their peers. Sometimes, these humans are indistinguishable from ordinary folks, but other times their psionic awakening leaves a tell-tale mark: stark white hair, glowing pupils, or hair and clothing that float and drift around them.

      <text>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an immobilizing gaze. Choose a creature you can see within 60 feet of you that can see you to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). A creature that is immune to being restrained automatically succeeds this saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated and its speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn.
	You can use your Immobilizing Gaze a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Humans are known for being ambitious, diverse, and extremely short-lived, but also have the dubious honor of having an abundance of near-human offshoots, for it seems humans can breed with just about anything. Near-humans are still basically humans, bearing subtly different traits from a wide variety of sources, and are individually rare but make up a surprisingly large portion of any human population.
	Near-humans come in all shapes and sizes and from all walks of life. They are the barest expression of human diversity: human offshoots from all corners of the world.

Your large nose, strong jaw, and wide head do much to reveal your distantly bovine nature, but the prominent bull-horns atop your head reveal to all that you are half-minotaur. Taurans tower over most people and can solve mazes with ease, but typically possess only a shadow of their minotaur parent's might.

With their green-tinted and boil-ridden skin, spindly fingers, and pointed teeth, few people will mark trollblooded individuals as half-human. These humans exclusively favor the look of their troll parentage and have immense difficulty in human society.

Carefree and constantly possessed of wanderlust, the extraordinarily pale windswept embody their connection to Elemental Air. Windswept humans are never likely to sleep in the same bed for two nights in a row; they are always moving, always exploring, and always following the wind. You are lighter than a normal human, capable of floating gently on the breeze, and have faint inborn power over the winds.
