      <name>Captain</name>
      <text>Leadership, the class

Brave commanders and savvy tacticians, captains control a second character i n the form of a cohort and enhance their allies in combat with dice-fueled maneuvers. Play a captain if you want to lead your allies to victory!

Note for the GM:
The craftsman, captain, and necromancer aren't recommended for first-time players. The captain and necromancer command more than one character at once, while the craftsman requires careful reading and understanding of their properties.
	Furthermore, discuss with the players before the campaign how best to approach martyrs, which have strong religious themes and references to blood, and necromancers, which are often overtly evil and might pose a challenge to roleplay.

A half-elf, adorned in the ribbons and medals of a high-ranking commander sits astride an armored warhorse. To her right, a powerfully built orcish man in more pedestrian attire sits atop his own horse, shouldering a hefty greataxe. They set down the road together, accompanied by blaring trumpets and banging drums, which announce their approach.
	Puffing on a pipe and eyeing the room, a halfling guildmaster in a fitted suit twirls a dagger between his fingers. A crowd of thieves, crooks, and bandits are arrayed before him, all studying blueprints laid out on a candlelit table. Tonight, their chapter of the Thieves' Guild becomes rich, and their guildmaster goes down in history.
	Kobolds swarm left and right, scampering across piles of gold pieces, only to be met by the dwarf's greataxe. Arrow after arrow, a human archer looses shots that merely plink off the enraged dragon's crimson scales. A gnomish mage gathers crackling arcane might in his hands for a devastating magical blast. Across the chamber, amidst the chaos, a plan crystallizes in the adventuring company's leader. She begins shouting orders, and the party sets into motion.
	Decisive leaders and brilliant strategists, captains inspire their allies to greatness. Invariably, they stand alongside their cohorts —their devoted lieutenants, whom they entrust with their lives. Captains outstrategize their enemies, ensuring that, while they rarely deal the killing blow, they're always on the winning side.

    <trait>
      <name>Fearless Leaders</name>
      <text>Many people aspire to command, but few inspire loyalty as a captain does. Captains rally allies to their side through confidence and determination, but gain long-term friends through wisdom and accountability.
	A good captain thinks a little bigger than their compatriots, planning one step further and fitting their allies like puzzle pieces to the challenges ahead. To their eyes, there are few defeats; only setbacks, diversions, and detours. Success is always on the path ahead.
	Moreover, captains lead by example. They stand shoulder-to-shoulder with knights, creep through the night alongside rogues, and study arcane texts with mages, even when they barely understand what they're reading. Captains are at the front line with their allies, not barking orders from afar.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Cohort and Commander</name>
      <text>A captain is only as good as their second in command, their cohort, who stands by them at every step and safeguards their plan's success. Far more than a simple ally, a captain's cohort is a confidant, an advisor, and a trusted friend. Cohorts see their captain as a wellspring of information, and will follow them to the ends of the earth.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Creating a Captain</name>
      <text>The ideal captain—a consummate leader-can be realized in many different ways. Your captain could be a head of an adventuring company, an officer in an army, the president of a corporation, the chief of a tribe, the admiral of a fleet, or any other type of leader. The only commonalities amongst captains are their positions of authority and natural inclinations toward leadership.
	You should consider how your captain chooses to lead: not simply what banner they fly, but how they treat their followers and how they give orders. Do you rally others to your side with a magnetic personality or a stoic facade? How would you deal with a dilemma that offers only losing strategies? How do you treat your opponents once you've secured victory? You should also think of previous victories or defeats that have defined your captain in the past.
	Has your story been that of a meteoric rise or a disgraceful fall? What event first thrust you into leadership, and how did you first take to it? Which success or defeat led you to the life of an adventurer?

Quick Build:
You can make a captain quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Next, select History and Persuasion as your skills, and take the Dueling Fighting Style. Lastly, choose a background reflecting your leadership experience.</text>

        <name>Multiclass Captain</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose captain as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a captain.

	• Strength or Dexterity 13
	• Charisma 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a captain.

	• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: none

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

      <feature>
        <name>Cohort</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you gain a loyal cohort who carries your banner and follows your lead.

Initiating A Cohort:
Select a companion from the Cohort section;
following an 8-hour initiation period, that creature becomes your cohort. You can have only one cohort at a time.
	If your cohort is ever slain, you can raise them from the dead by the usual methods, such as the raise dead spell, or you can spend 8 hours initiating a new cohort. If you do so, your previous cohort loses all abilities granted by this ability, even if it is later returned to life.
	Your cohort obeys your commands as best it can. Your cohort takes its turn immediately before or after your turn each round (your choice), and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and soon. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.

Cohort Features:
At 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, your cohort gains new abilities based on its archetype.

Hit Points:
For each captain level you gain after 2nd, your cohort gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.

Ability Scores:
Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your cohort's abilities also improve. Your cohort can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature, unless its description specifies otherwise.
	When you improve a cohort's ability scores, remember to also increase other relevant statistics, such as skill bonuses, bonuses to hit and damage, and spell save DCs.

Proficiencies:
Your cohort gains proficiency in skills listed in its statistics. It also gains proficiency with simple weapons, martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, or shields if its statistics contain weapons or armor from that category.
	Your cohort uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. Because cohort statistics already include a +2 proficiency bonus, you need only adjust the attack bonus, skill proficiencies, and saving throw proficiencies starting at 5th level.

Alignment:
Your cohort's alignment is within one step of your own, and has a personality trait and flaw determined by the GM. Its bond is always, "I will follow my commander into any fray, and I will gladly fight by their side until my death."

Customizing Cohorts:
Throughout your adventure, you may wish to customize your cohort beyond the weapons, armor, and spells listed in its stat block. Your GM decides what equipment your cohort has proficiency with, in addition to those specified in the Cohort feature, and decides if your cohort can exchange the spells it knows with any other spells, including new spells in this book.
	As with any character, your cohort can attune to three magic items at a time.

	Your battle die changes and more battle dice become available when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Battle Dice column of the Captain table.

Saving Throws:
If one of your maneuvers calls for a saving throw to resist its effects, the saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

	Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Maneuvers:
You can spend battle dice to use the following maneuvers:

Brace. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a battle die to bolster your allies. Each allied creature within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you adds the battle die to all saving throws it makes until the end of your next turn.

Rally. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a battle die to choose one allied creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you. That creature regains hit points equal to the number rolled + your Charisma modifier. You can't use this ability to heal a creature that has 0 hit points.

Staggering Strike. As a bonus action when you make a weapon attack against a Large or smaller creature, you can expend a battle die to attempt to daze the target. On a hit, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the start of your next turn.

	• 10th. Reaction: Retaliation (3/Day). In response to being hit by a melee attack, the berserker can make one melee weapon attack against the attacker.

    <description>Your cohort is the most steadfast of allies, is loyal to a fault, and will likely be a lifelong ally and friend. But not all cohorts are cut from the same cloth or possess the same skills. Choose from the following nonplayer characters when you enlist a new cohort.

With the help of a tinkerer or a mage, you gain the unwavering, mechanical loyalty of a golem, shield guardian, or clockwork construct. Your construct is of a smaller variety than most golems, but can be built and repaired in far less time.

While following the command of a captain, the construct gains additional abilities based on the captain's level:

	• 2nd. Surveillance Protocol. The construct gains blindsight out to a range of 60 feet. It also adds the captain's level to its passive Perception score.

	• 6th. Improved Armor. The construct's Armor Class increases by 1.

	• 6th. Death Burst. The construct's Death Burst now deals 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	• 10th. Magic Resistance. The construct has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

	• 14th. Improved Armor. The construct's Armor Class increases by 1.

	• 18th. Unerring Strike. Once on each of its turns, when the construct misses with a slam attack, it can reroll it.

    <description>Your cohort is the most steadfast of allies, is loyal to a fault, and will likely be a lifelong ally and friend. But not all cohorts are cut from the same cloth or possess the same skills. Choose from the following nonplayer characters when you enlist a new cohort.

With the help of necromancy, you can enlist the most loyal minion possible: a silent, obedient undead thrall. Zombies, ghouls, and revenants are the most common form of undead cohort, as they are sturdier than skeletons, and more loyal than vampires.

Undead Nature. An undead doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

While following the command of a captain, the undead gains additional abilities based on the captain's level:

	• 2nd: Turn Resistance. The undead has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

	• 6th: Necrotizing Bite. The undead's bite deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage on a hit.

	• 10th: Regeneration. The undead regains 1 hit point at the start of its turn. If the undead takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the undead's next turn. The undead dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

	• 14th: Improved Necrotizing Bite. The necrotic damage for the undead's bite increases to 7 (2d6), and the undead regains hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt on a hit.

	• 18th: Undead Horde. A Humanoid slain by the undead's bite attack rises 24 hours later as a zombie under the captain's control, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The captain can have no more than six zombies under its control a t one time. The zombies remain under the captain's control for 24 hours, after which the captain must cast the animate dead spell or use similar magic to reassert control over them.
