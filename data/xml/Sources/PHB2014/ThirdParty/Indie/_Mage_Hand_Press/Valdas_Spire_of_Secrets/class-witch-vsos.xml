    <trait>
      <name>Witch</name>
      <text>Debuff, the class

Afflicted by a sinister curse, witches can spin dark magic into hexes, which they use to debilitate foes. They are also accompanied by their familiars, loyal magical companions that they use to deal the killing blow. Play a witch if you want to hobble your enemies and cackle while doing so.

Three old crones stoop over a boiling cauldron filled with all manner of bizarre filth, churning and bubbling with noxious fumes. In the smoke and vapor above the pot, the trio can make out shapes and figures of great import, and one cackles loudly at what she sees.
	A young girl sits underneath a tree, far from where the other children play. She glances about to make sure no one is watching, and snaps her fingers once to the empty air. After a moment of silence, a black cat appears around the tree's bend and locks eyes with the girl, staring with a strange intelligence for a long moment. She gestures at one of the playing children, a heavyset boy with a permanently affixed scowl; the cat understands. It wanders close to the boy, stretches its claws, and gets very low, ready to pounce for the boy's eyes.
	A young elf intently mutters something under his breath each time he exhales. Visible only to him, a string of the foulest magic winds out from him and seizes a charging orc, which drops to its knees in agony.
	Witches are stricken by magic so dark it imprints a lasting shadow upon their essence. Through force of personality alone, they can spin this darkness outward, hexing creatures, casting manipulative spells, and even commanding a familiar with their thoughts.

    <trait>
      <name>Cursed</name>
      <text>While others are blessed with magic, witches are cursed by it. Afflicted by some hateful arcana, whether accidentally or intentionally, witches are twisted inside and out by its daily tortures. With grueling effort, they can warp this power into spells to wrack others with the same torment that plagues them.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Pariahs and Outcasts</name>
      <text>Almost without exception, witches are feared and hated. They are victim to a number of misconceptions, usually relating them to hags and other evil creatures of the night. As a result, known witches are in great personal danger and can usually be found dwelling on the outskirts of civilization where townsfolk seldom tread. This does little to stop witch hunting and burnings, but provides some measure of safety from them.
	In reality, very few choose to become witches, and many of them can hide adeptly in society, using their magic to fill a number of roles, from seer, to healer, to apothecary. Being accused as a witch carries grave consequences, no matter the validity of the claim, so wise witches relocate frequently, never residing in one place for too long.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Familiar Masters</name>
      <text>It is rare to find a witch without their constant companion, the familiar. Though familiars might be conjured by other spellcasters as well, a witch's familiar is ubiquitous to common folk for good reason. Witches command intuitive magic, and have a deep link to their familiars. As a result, they can conjure more exotic familiars, and command them more swiftly than other spellcasters.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Male and Female Witches</name>
      <text>Witches are commonly considered to be only female, but in reality, male and female witches exist in equal number. This misconception is due to the fact that male witches are often called "hexers," or are incorrectly deemed warlocks by common folk.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Creating a Witch</name>
      <text>Creating a witch necessarily involves a powerful, malicious curse in your backstory. Who cast it? Did you take a curse upon yourself for power? Was your entire lineage cursed generations ago, leading to a bloodline of witches, or did another spellcaster use sinister, forbidden magic to curse you for life? Decide on the nature of your witch's curse and think about how you relate to it. Do you feel like the curse was secretly a blessing, or does the desire for vengeance burn in your heart?
	What negative effects does the curse leverage on your personality and mind? Are you haunted by spirits, or is your mind plagued by destructive thoughts? How do you feel manipulating the power of this curse outwards into hexes and spells?
	Work with your GM to determine how witches are perceived in the world. Are they feared, burned, and persecuted? Are you an openly known witch? Do the other characters in your party know of your witchhood? Some witches keep the source of their magic a secret, or claim to be wizards or sorcerers to conceal the true darkness of their magic.

Quick Build:
To build a witch quickly, make Charisma your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Then, choose the acid splash, chill touch, hocuspocus, and minor illusion cantrips, and the hideous laughter and thunderwave spells. Choose the Hideous witch's curse, and the Evil Eye and Misfortune hexes. Lastly, choose any background that illustrates your life before being cursed.</text>

        <name>Multiclass Witch</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose witch as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a witch.

	• Charisma 13

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>You have learned to mold and reshape the magic that curses you into spells.

Cantrips. You know four cantrips of your choice from the witch spell list. You learn additional witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch table.

Spell Slots. The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your witch spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you know the Ist-level spell bane and have a lst-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast bane using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the witch spell list. The Spells Known column of the Witch table shows when you learn more witch spells of your choice.
	Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the witch spells you know and replace it with another spell from the witch spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells. Your magic originates deep within yourself, where your insidious curse stirs restlessly. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

	Spell Attack Modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Ritual Casting. You can cast any witch spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

Spellcasting Focus. You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your witch spells.

      <feature>
        <name>Witch's Curse</name>
        <text>You are wracked by a terrible curse, which infects your body and soul. At 1st level, choose the form that this curse takes from the options below.

Burned. Almost all of your body has been scorched by arcane flames, leaving you with striking black scars and embers of magic that burn under the skin. As a result, you have resistance to fire damage, and you know the produce flame cantrip, which doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.

Drowned. Water fills your lungs, and yet you do not die. You can breathe air and water. Additionally, you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

Feral. Through your curse, you have forgotten the manners and customs of civilized men and gone to live among beasts in the wild. You have proficiency in the Survival skill. Additionally, while you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

Hideous. Your appearance is ghastly to behold. You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill. When you roll initiative, you can choose one Humanoid you can see to scare. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

Hollow. Your soul has been divorced from your body, trapping you in a limbo between life and death. When you or your familiar reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you drain some of its life force, gaining temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your witch level (minimum of 1).

Infested. You are constantly followed by vermin, like insects and rats, which crawl on your skin and swarm in your wake. As a result, you are immune to disease. Additionally, you can command these pests as your own. Starting at 2nd level, you can choose the form of a swarm of rats for your familiar. Starting at 7th level, you can choose a swarm of insects.

Loveless. You are cursed to never find true love. Jaded and disaffected, not even magic can turn your heart; as a result, you are immune to being charmed.

Possessed. Your soul is occupied by a foreign spirit that sometimes tries to wrest away your consciousness. However, while you sleep, the spirit whispers magical secrets to you. You learn an additional witch spell at a level for which you have spell slots at 1st level, and again at 4th level, 8th level, and 12th level. These spells don't count against your number of spells known.

Starving. No matter how much you eat, food turns to ash in your mouth. Your curse nourishes you, but only at the edge of starvation, and you are constantly wracked by pangs of hunger. You don't need to eat or drink, but can still imbibe and benefit from potions. Additionally, you are immune to the poisoned condition.

Visions. You are cursed to have terrible visions of the future, presaging the death of your friends, family, and yourself. Though many of these visions are cruel deceptions, they are sometimes grimly accurate. You can add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.

Whispers. Unseen voices murmur in your ears at all times. As such, you can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathy, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

You learn an additional witch spell at a level for which you have spell slots at 1st level, and again at 4th level, 8th level, and 12th level. These spells don't count against your number of spells known.

        <name>Hexes</name>
        <text>You can learn a number of powerful incantations, known as hexes, derived from the same insidious magic that cursed you.
	At 1st level, you gain two hexes of your choice. Your hex options are detailed in the "Witch (Valda): Hexes" spell list. When you reach certain levels in this class, you gain additional hexes of your choice, as shown in the Hexes Known column of the Witch table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the hexes you know and replace it with another hex.
	Unless otherwise stated, if a hex requires an attack roll or saving throw, it uses your spell attack modifier and spell save DC. All hexes require either verbal or somatic components (your choice at the time of casting the hex).
	Unless otherwise noted, if a hex lasts for a duration, you concentrate on it as you would a spell. You lose your concentration on a hex if you cast another hex; however, you can concentrate on a hex and a spell at the same time, making only one Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration on both.

	Not all witches laugh maniacally when they cackle, but all cackles require a verbal component, as if casting a spell. These range from mundane curses and insults, to the murmuring of dead languages and speaking backwards.

	• Your familiar takes its turn immediately before or after your turn each round (your choice).

	• Once on each of your turns as an action or a bonus action, you can mentally command your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack.

	• You can use the find familiar spell to deliver spells that have ranges other than touch through your familiar.

	• When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: death snail,* flying book,* homunculus, mock,* moon jelly,* pet rock, * pseudodragon, rag doll, * sprite, tin soldier,* winter wolf pup,* and yarn golem.* The statistics for creatures marked with an asterisk can be found in the bestiary.

Witch Familiar:
As a witch, familiars you summon are imbued with your insidious magic, granting them the following benefits:

	• Your familiar can use your spell attack modifier for its attack rolls.

	• Your familiar adds your proficiency bonus to its Armor Class, saving throws, and damage rolls.

	• You add twice your witch level to your familiar's hit point maximum.

        <name>Witch's Craft</name>
        <text>A witch's craft is distinct from a school of magic. Whereas magical schools seek to categorize spells, crafts are defined by the use of magic, and seek to capture the essence of spells. There are dozens of varieties, from those practiced by covens in secret, to those plied in marketplace potion shops. Each craft has a number of Craft Spells. New spells are marked with an asterisk.

Your skill in magic has culminated in learning a craft, an innate variety of magic that exists apart from the schools of magic. When you reach 3rd level, choose one Witch's Craft. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
	If your craft grants you a hex at any level, it doesn't count against your number of hexes known.

Craft Spells:
Each craft is associated with a branch of arcana, represented by a number of spells that you learn. The levels of these spells are noted in the craft description. These spells count as witch spells for you but don't count against your number of spells known.

Furthermore, all hexes cease while in the area of an antimagic field or similar effect.

    <text>You can induct others into your insidious coven. By performing a special ritual over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can intermingle your cursed magic with a willing creature that has the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature. This creature enters into your coven. You can have up to two creatures other than yourself in your coven at a time.
	While two or more members of your coven are within 30 feet of one another, they gain the ability to cast additional spells, as shown on the Coven Spellcasting table. Additionally, members of your coven gain access to a shared pool of five spell slots—one of each level, from 1st to 5th level—which they can use to cast spells as normal. Expended spell slots are regained when all members of the coven finish a long rest.
	Coven members use their own spellcasting ability to determine spell attack modifiers and spell save DCs. A coven member can't cast spells of a level for which it doesn't personally have spell slots, even if using a higher level shared spell slot. A shared spell slot can be used, for instance, to cast a lower level spell at higher levels, but it can't be used to cast a spell normally too high-level for a spellcaster.

Coven Spellcasting:
Spell Level Spells
1st | bane, hideous laughter
2nd | invisibility, ray of enfeeblement
3rd | bestow curse, counterspell
4th | banishment, polymorph
5th | contagion, scrying

	• Your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier, as long as you aren't wielding a shield. You can use this calculation to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC.

	• You gain two natural melee weapons, corresponding to your familiar's attacks. You are proficient with these weapons, and use Charisma for their attack and damage rolls. On a hit, these natural weapons deal 1d10 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice).

	• You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.

	• You can use any action or movement your familiar possesses.

This transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it on your turn (no action required). When it ends, your familiar is dismissed, and you can't summon it again until you finish a short or long rest.

	• You regain hit points equal to twice your witch level + your Charisma modifier

	• You regain an expended spell slot of 5th level or lower.

	• You can end one of the following conditions affecting you: blinded, deafened, paralyzed (if the apple is fed to you as an action), or poisoned.

However, the apple is suffused with your insidious magic. If a creature other than you eats the apple, it doesn't gain any benefits and instead must make a Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed save, the creature becomes poisoned for up to 24 hours. For each hour the creature is poisoned, it loses 4d8 hit points. This loss can't be reduced or avoided. If this reduction causes the creature to drop to 0 hit points, the creature instead drops to 1 hit point and falls into a catatonic sleep, remaining unconscious for up to 7 days. A remove curse spell or similar magic can awaken the creature early.
	The apple shrivels and becomes nonmagical if it isn't eaten within 24 hours. Once you produce a magical apple, you can't produce another one until you finish a long rest.

You don't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

	This possession lasts for 1 hour, or until the body drops to 0 hit points or you are forced out by a spell or other magical effect that ends possession.

    <text>You can use your action to enchant a nonmagical object-such as a broom, cauldron, or rug-to fly for you. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet while holding this item, as long as you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor, or wielding a shield. This object remains enchanted until you use this grand hex to enchant a different object.

    <text>You can perform a 24-hour ritual to enchant a structure that can fit within a 15-foot cube, animating it as a Huge object, as per the animate objects spell. The structure rises up on a pair of magical legs and follows your commands.
	The entrance to the structure is linked to an extradimensional dwelling, as per the magnificent mansion spell. You can command the structure from inside this dwelling. If the structure is destroyed, the extradimensional dwelling is unharmed, but any creatures inside it are expelled into the unoccupied spaces nearest to the entrance.
	As an action, you can teleport the structure to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you. Once you teleport the structure, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
	You can repeat the 24-hour ritual to end the enchantment on your previous structure and enchant a new one.
