      <text>Alchemy, the class

Using half-science, half-magic concoctions, alchemists brew up explosives and transmutative potions on the fly. Play an alchemist if you want to experiment with a wide array of scientific discoveries and lethal bombs!

A grinning gnome cackles with glee as he hurls a bomb into a group of charging goblins, blasting them into scorched chunks. He produces another, throws it at his feet, and disappears, still laughing, into the ensuing cloud of smoke.
	A slender elf quickly mixes liquids and herbs in a small bowl. She applies the mixture to an arrow wound on an injured dwarf's side, which immediately stops bleeding.
	Whether their methods are explosive, transformative, or restorative, alchemists live to transmute the world around them to their liking.

      <name>Chemical Reactions</name>
      <text>One of the first things an alchemist learns is how to mix chemicals that react explosively with each other. Ostensibly, this is taught to students to prevent deadly accidents, but adventuring alchemists regularly apply this knowledge to create bombs.
	An alchemical bomb is a 1-pound, apple-sized, spherical glass or clay flask filled with a reactive chemical. A smaller vial of thin glass containing a reagent is suspended in the liquid, and the whole thing is sealed with a cork or wax seal. The chemicals violently explode when mixed. This occurs when the inner vial breaks, usually after the bomb impacts a solid surface or a fuse sets off a small explosive detonator within the vial. Bombs are primarily used to fend off enemies, but creative alchemists may find more practical uses for explosives, such as demolishing obstacles.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Serums and Tinctures</name>
      <text>More experienced alchemists learn to mix less volatile substances into potions, alchemical concoctions that replicate magical effects. These potions range from the medicinal, such as potions of healing, to the transformative, such as potions of gaseous form, to the downright deadly, such as potions of poison. Undisputed masters of potions, alchemists constantly innovate with new formulations and preparations, improving their potions into magic items in their own right.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Elemental Sciences</name>
      <text>The primary source of alchemy's power comes from the elemental planes. It is no surprise, then, that alchemists strive to tap deeper into that power, researching and discovering new compounds composed of the elements. The pinnacle of alchemy is the philosopher's stone, which is rumored to grant its bearer supreme elemental power. Few alchemists have succeeded in creating a philosopher's stone, and fewer still remain alive to divulge its secrets.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Creating an Alchemist</name>
      <text>When you create an alchemist, consider why you study alchemy. Are you attracted to its dangerous power or its ability to help others? Do you desire to use magic, but lack the aptitude or inborn ability?
	Why do you adventure? Are you searching for new alchemical formulae or rare ingredients? Do you, like so many, seek the philosopher's stone?
	Be sure to understand alchemy's place in your campaign world. You might have learned your trade from a master or studied alongside artificers and wizards in a university. Your trade might be commonplace or an oddity. Depending on the setting, you might be respected for your knowledge or feared for your destructive potential.

Quick Build:
You can make an alchemist quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Choose any background of your choice, preferably one that lends insight into your history with alchemy.</text>

        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose alchemist as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already am alchemist.

	• Intelligence 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as an alchemist.

	• Armor: light armor
	• Weapons: bombs
	• Tools: alchemist's supplies

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

        <name>Natural Philosopher</name>
        <text>You have learned much about alchemy during your studies. Starting at 1st level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded up, to any ability check you make to identify herbs, potions, poisons, or other alchemical substances. If the ability check already includes your proficiency bonus, you can add this bonus in addition to your normal proficiency bonus.

      <feature>
        <name>Bombs</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you can create volatile alchemical bombs using your alchemist's supplies. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can create a number of bombs equal to 10 + twice your alchemist level. For you the cost of materials necessary to create these bombs is negligible. After 24 hours, an unused bomb becomes inert. The statistics of a bomb are shown in the Bomb sidebar below.

Priming Bombs. Once per turn you can take the Use an Object action to prime a bomb with explosive reagents and make an attack with it, increasing the bomb's explosive potential. When you do so, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Dexterity, to the bomb's damage roll.
	Additionally, when you throw a bomb in this way, its damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

Saving Throws. When you throw a bomb, the save DC for its blast radius is calculated as follows:

	Bomb save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Bomb:
Bombs are exotic ranged weapons with the following statistics:

Name | Cost | Damage | Weight | Properties
Bomb | 2 sp | 1d10 fire | 1 lb | Finesse, special, thrown, (range 30/90)

Special Property:
Bomb. When a bomb hits a target, it explodes in a 15-foot diameter sphere and is destroyed. The bomb can be thrown at an unoccupied space within its range. Each creature other than the target within the blast radius (for a Medium or smaller target, each creature within 5 feet of it) must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking half the damage rolled on a failed save, or no damage on a successful one.
	Additionally, as a bonus action, you can empty some of the bomb's explosive material to permanently remove the blast radius from this bomb, dealing damage only to the bomb's target.

        <text>By 2nd level, your research has granted you insight into new alchemical formulations for your bombs. Select three bomb formulae from the Bomb Formulae spell list. Once per turn when you prime a bomb, you can apply a formula to it. Applying a formula sometimes changes all of the damage dice rolled for a bomb, but also grants it special effects.
	When you gain certain levels in this class, you learn additional formulae of your choice, as shown in the Bomb Formulae Known column of the Alchemist table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the formulae you know and replace it with another formula.

        <name>Field of Study</name>
        <text>All alchemists learn the basics of their science: the elements, chemical reactions, and alchemical formulae. Beyond that, alchemists pick up a specialty that they practice and research in depth. Some focus on the healing arts and some focus on destruction, while others focus on research or potion-brewing. Fields of study are as varied as the alchemists who research them and have applications equally as diverse.

While all alchemists share a common knowledge base, most alchemists specialize into a particular field of study. When you reach 2nd level, you select your field of study, which grants you features at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 18th level.
	A formula granted by your field of study doesn't count against the total number of formulae you know.

        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you have a collection of powerful alchemical reagents, represented by a pool of reagent dice, that you can spend to brew potions or magnify the power of your explosives.

Reagent Dice:
You start with three reagent dice, which are d10s, and you gain additional reagent dice as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Reagent Dice column of the Alchemist table. You regain all expended reagent dice when you finish a long rest.
	When you prime a bomb, you can expend a number of reagent dice up to your proficiency bonus and add the dice to the bomb's damage roll.

Brewing Potions:
You can spend 10 minutes and expend any number of reagent dice to brew potions. These potions retain potency for 24 hours, after which they become inert. If a potion calls for a saving throw, it uses your bomb save DC.
	The number of reagent dice and the alchemist level required to brew a potion are given on the Potions table.

Potions:
Potion | Cost | Alchemist Level
Potion of Climbing | 1 reagent die | 3rd
Potion of Growth | 1 reagent die | 3rd
Potion of Healing | 1 reagent die | 3rd
Potion of Water Breathing | 1 reagent die | 3rd
Universal Solvent | 1 reagent die | 3rd

Potion of Flying | 4 reagent dice | 14th
Potion of Hill Giant Strength | 4 reagent dice | 14th
Potion of Invisibility | 4 reagent dice | 14th
Potion of Superior Healing | 4 reagent dice | 14th

Reagent Synthesis:
When you finish a short rest, you can choose to regain all of your expended reagent dice that weren't used to brew potions. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

        <name>Philosopher's Stone</name>
        <text>At 20th level, you unlock the crowning achievement of all alchemy: a philosopher's stone, a dynamo of alchemical energy in a fist-sized, glowing jewel. You can construct your philosopher's stone using your alchemist's supplies, 1,000 gp worth of materials, and 7 days of work. You can only have one philosopher's stone at a time. As long as you possess the stone, you gain the following benefits:

	• Whenever you finish a short rest, you regain all expended reagent dice.

	• You can brew potions as an action, instead of over the course of 10 minutes.

	• You age 10 times slower than normal, and you can't be aged magically.

Additionally, you learn the following formula, which doesn't count against the total number of formulae you know:

Formula: Nuclear Bomb
By replacing your bomb's explosive contents with your philosopher's stone, you can change it into a nuclear bomb. A nuclear bomb deals 10d10 + 100 force damage instead of its normal fire damage, has a blast radius of 1 mile, and completely destroys the philosopher's stone. Additionally, each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw takes the full bomb damage rolled, or half as much damage on a successful save. Creatures within 60 feet of the bomb gain no benefit from Evasion or similar features.

The study of mind-affecting alchemy is a delicate one, practiced only by a small number of alchemists known as amorists. Often called "love doctors" by their clientele, amorists specialize in brewing of potions that produce strong emotional responses in their drinkers. While love potions are by far their most popular product, amorists can also craft pungent pheromone bombs that can even soften the hearts of terrible monsters.

Some alchemists have founded their careers on this notion, inventing and iterating upon small devices known as spell dynamos which store and manipulate arcane energy. These dynamos can be configured to store their energy at a specific resonance, such that, when it is released, it perfectly replicates the effect of a spell. Indeed, these few alchemists have begun to brave the frontier of spellcasting without an ounce of arcane talent; just a knack for tinkering and endless inventiveness.

        <text>Also at 2nd level, you can cast spells by storing and releasing energy in spell dynamos. See the core rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the wizard spell list.

Spell Dynamos. You power your spells through handheld arcane devices called spell dynamos, which each hold a single spell slot. The Dynamo Engineer Spellcasting table shows how many spell dynamos you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots held in each of your dynamos is; all of these spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your wizard spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell dynamo. You regain all expended spell dynamos when you finish a long rest.

Preparing Spells. Unlike other spells, you must prepare the spells held in each of your spell dynamos in advance. When you finish a long rest, you configure each of your dynamos to cast a particular wizard spell you know. You can only use a spell dynamo to cast a spell to which it is configured. When you finish a short or long rest, you can reconfigure your unexpended dynamos to hold different spells.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the evocation and transmutation spells on the wizard spell list.
	The Spells Known column of the Dynamo Engineer Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
	The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, y o u can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation or transmutation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you cast them using cutting-edge arcane technology. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Use your bomb save DC as the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast, and use your Intelligence modifier when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell Attack Modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Each creature other than the target within the blast radius (for a Medium or smaller target, each creature within 5 feet of it) must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking half the damage rolled on a failed save, or no damage on a successful one.
	Additionally, as a bonus action, you can empty some of the bomb's explosive material to permanently remove the blast radius from this bomb, dealing damage only to the bomb's target.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>By adding a potent fertilizer to your bomb's explosive contents, you can change it into a bramble bomb. A bramble bomb deals no damage, but instead causes tough, thorny brambles to sprout from any area of natural ground within the bomb's blast radius, which becomes difficult terrain. Additionally, if a creature in the blast radius is prone when the bomb detonates, it is enveloped by the brambles and must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check against your bomb save DC before it can move or stand. The brambles shrivel and die after 1 minute.

    <text>By replacing your bomb's explosive contents with a wad of thermal cotton, you can change it into a quiet bomb. A quiet bomb's damage dice are d8s. When this bomb detonates, it makes only a low thud, audible out to 10 feet, and releases a puff of smoke to mask the light given off by its blast. Creatures have disadvantage on ability checks to detect that this bomb was detonated nearby.

Special: When a bomb hits a target, it explodes in a 15-foot diameter sphere and is destroyed. The bomb can be thrown at an unoccupied space within its range. Each creature other than the target within the blast radius (for a Medium or smaller target, each creature within 5 feet of it) must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking half the damage rolled on a failed save, or no damage on a successful one.
	Additionally, as a bonus action, you can empty some of the bomb's explosive material to permanently remove the blast radius from this bomb, dealing damage only to the bomb's target.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack.

    <text>Prerequisite: Ooze Rancher Field of Study

You can mix your bomb's explosive contents with the remnants of an Ooze, changing it into a slime bomb. A slime bomb deals no damage, but coats each creature within the blast radius in a viscous, green slime. A creature coated in slime can't take the Dash or Disengage actions. Slime can be removed by dousing a creature with a gallon of water or by taking an action to remove most of it.

Special: When a bomb hits a target, it explodes in a 15-foot diameter sphere and is destroyed. The bomb can be thrown at an unoccupied space within its range. Each creature other than the target within the blast radius (for a Medium or smaller target, each creature within 5 feet of it) must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, taking half the damage rolled on a failed save, or no damage on a successful one.
	Additionally, as a bonus action, you can empty some of the bomb's explosive material to permanently remove the blast radius from this bomb, dealing damage only to the bomb's target.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>Prerequisite: Ooze Rancher Field of Study

You can mix a few drops of a fast-acting toxin into your bomb's explosive components, changing it into a venom bomb. A venom bomb deals poison damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d8s, and it requires a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity saving throw.
	Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, has disadvantage on the next Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.

Special: When a bomb hits a target, it explodes in a 15-foot diameter sphere and is destroyed. The bomb can be thrown at an unoccupied space within its range. Each creature other than the target within the blast radius (for a Medium or smaller target, each creature within 5 feet of it) must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, taking half the damage rolled on a failed save, or no damage on a successful one.

	• Your homunculus can take the Attack action on its turn.

When your homunculus dies, its body remains, and can be reanimated in a procedure requiring 1 hour of work, which can be performed over the course of a short or long rest.
