      <name>Warden</name>
      <text>Tank, the class

Wardens are tanks of the battlefield that refuse to give an inch. When overwhelming enemies bear down, wardens hold the line for the party and single out targets from the crowd until the tide turns in their favor. Play a warden if you want to be a tough-to-kill warrior with a focus on crowd control.

An immense goblinoid army stretches from the horizon to the castle walls. In the breach, a single knight holds back the horde, eviscerating all comers, and allowing none to pass.
	Blood dripping from his blade, a scarred halforc gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint, his eyes alight with bestial fury.
	Advancing slowly, an elf brandishing a green scimitar emerges from the foliage before two poachers. Startled, they turn to run, but find their feet bound fast by leaves and vines.
	Wardens are vigilant guardians that adopt a charge—be it a kingdom, a forest, or an individualand safeguard it from harm. Through both their fortitude and shields, they are immovable bulwarks on the field of battle.

    <trait>
      <name>Guardian's Call</name>
      <text>Every warden feels a gravitational pull to defend the helpless. Sometimes, they are directly called, such as when a village or tribe selects their mightiest member to defend them, or when the spirits of a sacred grove beckon a new champion to protect their forest. Other times, the warden is compelled by more subtle means, such as witnessing uncontested injustice, or feeling the weight of responsibility when tragedy occurs. The result is the same: wardens that conclude their minds and pick up their shields to answer the call.
	Wherever wardens travel, new calls make themselves evident. There is never a shortage of those in need, whereas those with strength and conscience are perpetually in short supply.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Primal Strength</name>
      <text>Wardens are like mighty trees in a gale storm or the rocks along the shore, constantly battered by waves. They demonstrate almost supernatural resilience to hardship, and can't be easily broken or slain.
	Most wardens draw their might from the wild-the strength of the earth beneath their feet and the vitality of the air in their lungs-though some attribute their resiliency to an inward resolve or the absolute belief in a deity. Regardless of its source, a warden's power is intuitive and forceful, allowing them to stop foes dead in their tracks, mark those standing in their way, and shug off otherwise deadly conditions. Only those wardens who choose to defend an obviously magical charge appear to be supernatural; others simply possess a daunting force of will and bottomless tolerance for punishment.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Creating a Warden</name>
      <text>When creating a warden, consider what drives you. What brought you to raise up your shield for others? Do you fight to protect an individual or a particular location? A threat to your homeland or loved ones might have been your catalyst, but you also might have risen to combat a menace to the natural world. What was your call, and how do you honor it? What motivates you to keep fighting, even when you're at death's door?
	Most wardens have been recognized as exemplary defenders. Perhaps, you are known as a wandering knight of the northern provinces, or perhaps you were beckoned by spirits of the forest to protect them from invaders. Who has called you, and how did you respond?

Quick Build:
You can build a warden quickly with these suggestions. First, make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Strength and Dexterity. Then, choose the Primal Toughness option for Sentinel's Stand. Finally, choose any background, preferably one that sheds light on your history of guardianship.</text>

        <name>Starting Warden</name>
        <text>As a 1st-level Warden, you begin play with 6 + your Constitution modifier hit points.

You are proficient with the following items, in addition to any proficiencies provided by your race or background.

	• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: none

        <name>Multiclass Warden</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose warden as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a warden.

	• Strength 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a warden.

	• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: none

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

Battle Dice. You have two battle dice, which are d8s. A battle die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended battle dice when you finish a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative.
	Your battle die changes and more battle dice become available when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the following table.

Battle Tactics:
Warden Level | Battle Dice
3rd | 2d8
7th | 3d8
13th | 3d10
19th | 4d10

Using Battle Dice. Once per turn, you can expend a battle die to perform a maneuver of your choice. Your maneuver options are detailed at the end of the subclass description.

Saving Throws. Some of your maneuvers require the target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

	Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

        <name>Maneuvers (Grey Watchman)</name>
        <text>The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.

Bull Rush. When you move at least 10 feet in a straight line and immediately make a melee weapon attack against a creature, you can use a bonus action and expend a battle die to shove the target after the attack. Add the battle die to the Strength (Athletics) check you make to shove the target. On a success, you can choose to either knock the target prone or push it up to 10 feet away from you.

Bulwark. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can expend a battle die as a bonus action to brace yourself for its counterattack. The next time you take damage from that creature before the start of your next turn, you can roll the battle die and reduce the damage you take by the number rolled.

Cleave. Once on each of your turns, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points or score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can spend a battle die to move up to 15 feet and make another melee weapon attack as part of the same action. On a hit, you add the battle die to the attack's damage roll.

Heel-Cutter. When you make an opportunity attack against a creature, you can expend one battle die to knock the creature off balance, preventing it from escaping. You add the battle die to the attack roll, and on a hit, the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its turn.

Reckless Assault. When you make an attack against a creature, you can expend a battle die to make a wild, desperate strike, leaving you vulnerable. You have advantage on the attack roll. Until the start of your next turn, however, attack rolls against you have advantage.

Staggering Strike. As a bonus action when you make a weapon attack against a Large or smaller creature, you can expend a battle die to attempt to daze the target. On a hit, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the start of your next turn.

Cantrips. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots. The Soulblood Shaman Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You know three 1st-level druid spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the evocation or transmutation spells on the druid spell list.

You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

        <text>At 20th level, as an action, you can shrug off your mortal form for a short time to become something spiritual and immaterial, an ethereal watcher. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

	• As a bonus action on your turn, you can become ethereal, as per the etherealness spell.

	• You can use your bonus action to return from being ethereal when you use your Warden's Mark or your Warden's Grasp feature. You can use your bonus action to return from being ethereal when you cast a spell on your turn.

	• When you return from being ethereal, each creature you choose within 10 feet of you takes 4d6 force damage, as they are pulled partially between the planes.

	• You can cast 1st and 2nd-level druid spells you know without expending spell slots.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

        <text>An unyielding protector of mountain strongholds.

You heard the steadfast, unyielding call from the mountains, which dwarves and gnomes have felt for generations. The stones called to you, beckoning for a protector to defend the mountains from those that would despoil them, from both within and without. You might be a watchman of old dwarven walls or a sentinel patrolling the lookouts of high mountain peaks. Regardless of where you stand, you are unmovable: a mountain in the shape of a man. You draw your power from the earth beneath your feet and can crush your enemies with the strength of stone.
