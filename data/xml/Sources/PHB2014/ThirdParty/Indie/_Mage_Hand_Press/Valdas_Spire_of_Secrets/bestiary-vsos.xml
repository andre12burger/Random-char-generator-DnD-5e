    <description>A death snail is formed from a vile concoction of forest troll bone meal, giant eagle blood, and goblin bone meal, enclosed in a hollowed-out efreet horn, and sealed shut with an ettercap tongue. The resulting monstrosity possesses a dull intelligence, but its only impulse is to slay all creatures other than its master.

    <description>Little can be said about the flying book that is not readily apparent. Though it is indistinguishable from an arcanist's spellbook while motionless, this animated arcane tome can flutter through the air at a moment's notice, using its cover as rudimentary wings. Flying books are playful and enjoy the sensation of being written in.

    <description>Hauntings can often be attributed to the usual spectral suspects: ghosts, specters, shadows, and poltergeists. But benign hauntings, where a restless spirit merely plays tricks on the living, are usually caused by a fright. These spirits tend to be the artifacts of children or entertainers, clinging to the afterlife for company and a semblance of affection, and are as such preoccupied with fun. They never willingly harm others when they haunt a house, and they will serve any master that conjures them, if only for the sake of inclusion.

    <description>A grep is an underground scavenger, known for using its keen vision, acute hearing, and silent flight to trick and steal from travelers, hoarding its possessions in well-hidden troves. Arcanists use greps as messengers and scouts, but they excel as retrievers; a grep can be given the name of an important object and sent to find it, returning a short time later with its prize.

In the desert, a mock might take the form of a canteen of precious water, and in a dungeon, it may replicate a sizable jewel or a spare gold piece. If an adventurer is caught by surprise, a mock is just as dangerous as its larger relatives, for it can hide in far less conspicuous places.

    <description>When fully grown, a winter wolf is an apex predator of the snow, a terror of teeth and fur, stalking the tundra in packs. But before they develop their fearsome freezing breath, winter wolf pups are far more amicable (perhaps because they have yet to realize the scope of their own might), and will dutifully follow a master that feeds them well and treats them with respect.

    <description>The greatest of golems are formed of clay, stone, and iron, but the least of them are constructed of yarn. Balled and sewn into a vaguely humanoid shape, yarn golems are among the first animated objects that arcanists learn to create, practicing with them obsessively until they master the basics and move onto more rigid materials. Yarn golems are friendly and playful, but risk foolishly unraveling themselves if they catch on sharp objects.
