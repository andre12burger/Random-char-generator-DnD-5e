    <trait>
      <name>Necromancer</name>
      <text>Minionmancy, the class

Necromancy, the grim magic of death, is laden with forbidden secrets and unquestionably evil spells. Its practitioners, therefore, are a unique breed, possessing a well of dark energy and an edge for scoring critical hits with spells, to say nothing of their armies of undead thralls. Play a necromancer to balance ethics against ambition and manage multiple monsters at the table.

Note for the GM:
The craftsman, captain, and necromancer aren't recommended for first-time players. The captain and necromancer command more than one character at once, while the craftsman requires careful reading and understanding of their properties.
	Furthermore, discuss with the players before the campaign how best to approach martyrs, which have strong religious themes and references to blood, and necromancers, which are often overtly evil and might pose a challenge to roleplay.

A withered old woman reaches out and grasps a battle-hardened knight by the arm. The knight laughs at the crone's gesture before collapsing in mere seconds, desiccated and dead.
	A scarred and grizzled warrior in breastplate leads a charge through a detachment of soldiers, swinging a glaive shrouded in dark energies at her foes. A shambling, undead vanguard follows her path, and her slain foes rise to join their ranks.
	A grim, robed figure presides before his court, all arranged in a marble hall of gothic construction. Shambling corpses, abominations of flesh and bone, and dead-eyed, charmed nobles wait in attendance, forming perfect lines in silent obedience.
	Necromancers are spellcasters that hold sway over the forces of life and death, twisting them to serve their own ambitions and commanding small armies of lifeless, animated thralls.

    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Morbid Curiosity</name>
      <text>Necromancers must match their grand intellects with an equal lack of scruples-the willingness to turn to forbidden knowledge and unquestionably evil methods. No matter their means, every necromancer is driven by a deep fascination with the dark arts and the power necromancy can afford them. Most see themselves as outcast members of the academic elite, braving new territories of magic that other spellcasters are too cowardly to explore.
	However, collecting knowledge expanding their understanding is merely a means to an end for most necromancers; they are almost always driven by a deeper, darker impulse, a goal that pushes them to the utter brink. This might be the distorted ideal of a "greater good" or a goal to right the wrong of mortality. In every case, necromancy is a grim implement for their life's work.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Masters of Undeath</name>
      <text>Necromancers have learned through trial and error how to puppet the flesh, bone, and spirits of the dead, binding them to their will. Through their terrible magic, they command the forms of lesser undead, and demand respect from those powerful enough to resist their thrall. All necromancers share the capability of simply animating corpses, along with the knowledge and foresight to create new and terrible undead abominations to further their goals.
	Beyond the basic command over the undead, each necromancer specializes in a method to impart their will upon the world. Some dive deeply into the necromantic arts or focus on their ability to assert control over the weak, while others still master the art of both martial and magical combat. Though their skills might seem specialized, properly prepared necromancers can dominate both on the battlefield and at the round table.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Variant Thralls</name>
      <text>With the GM's permission, Undead raised using the Animate Thralls ritual can be of types other than Humanoids. Such thralls might use existing Undead statistics (such as various skeletons, zombies, or spirits) when appropriate, or might use thrall statistics with variant weapons, AC, or traits.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Creating a Necromancer</name>
      <text>As you create your necromancer, the most important piece of information to consider is your character's ambition. What is your goal? How do you intend to achieve it? How does necromancy fit into the picture? Once you've decided on your ambition, consider why you turned to necromancy to accomplish it. Were you scorned by your previous spellcasting master? Did you come across an old, rotting tome filled with forgotten knowledge? Were you the survivor of some great attack by another necromancer?
	Work with your GM to determine how necromancy is viewed in the world. Is it just another method of spellcasting, or is it an abominable tool, used only by the most abhorred spellcasters? How do commoners react when they see you? Must you hide your thralls from public scrutiny, and if so, how? Furthermore, do the other player characters know of your sinister magic, and if so, how have they reacted to seeing your puppeteered corpses? Work with other players, especially those with cleric and paladin characters, to find suitable reasons you might work together.

Quick Build:
You can make a necromancer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution, and then Strength or Dexterity if you plan to choose the Death Knight ambition. Second, choose a background of your choice, preferably one that ties into your ambition. Third, choose chill touch, hocuspocus, light, and spark of life for your cantrips, and then choose Gahoul's shrieking skull and mage armor as your Ist-level spells.</text>

        <name>Multiclass Necromancer</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose necromancer as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a necromancer.

	• Intelligence 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a necromancer.

	• Armor: none
	• Weapons: simple weapons
	• Tools: none

      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

      <feature>
        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>Your connection to the realm of negative energy allows you to cast powerful necromantic spells.

Cantrips. At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the necromancer spell list. You learn additional necromancer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Necromancer table.

Spell Slots. The Necromancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast spells of the 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the necromancer spell list.
	You learn an additional necromancer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the necromancer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the necromancer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your necromancer spells, since your power is rooted in the fine manipulation of negative energy and research into magical secrets. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a necromancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Ritual Casting. You can cast any necromancer spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

Spellcasting Focus. You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your necromancer spells. For a necromancer, these are typically objects with sentimental value, such as a locket, childhood toy, prison shackle, or wedding ring, which are altered with magically conductive materials.

        <name>Charnel Touch</name>
        <text>Your connection to the negative energy realm grants you an inner nexus of dangerous power, ready to be unleashed at a moment's notice. Starting at 1st level, you have a pool of Charnel Touch points equal to your necromancer level × 5 that replenishes when you finish a long rest.
	As an action, declare the number of points you wish to expend, up to a maximum of 5 x your proficiency bonus, and make a melee spell attack against one creature within your reach. On a hit, you expend the declared amount of points and deal necrotic damage equal to the points expended. If the attack misses, you don't expend any points. The damage dealt by your Charnel Touch is doubled when you score a critical hit, expending no additional points.
	This attack deals no damage to Constructs and instead heals Undead for the number of points expended. You can target a willing creature with this ability without making a spell attack roll.

        <name>Thralls</name>
        <text>While lesser spellcasters can only animate flesh and bone in a rudimentary fashion, and must expend valuable energy to maintain their undead's loyalty, true necromancers can provide their undead with a portion of their own life force, ensuring long-term obedience. Beginning at 2nd level, you learn an ancient and powerful ritual that allows you to raise and command your own army of the undead.

Animate Thralls:
By spending 10 uninterrupted minutes performing this ritual with a spellcasting focus or component pouch, you can raise the remains of one or more Small or Medium Humanoids within 30 feet of you into Undead creatures. Undead created in this way become your thralls. You maintain control over your thralls indefinitely. Stat blocks for skeletons, zombies, and other thralls can be found in the Undead Thralls section at the end of the class description.

Commanding Thralls:
You can mentally control all of your thralls while you are conscious without using any actions. If you are unconscious, your thralls will move to protect your body from harm, but will not attack.
	In combat, your thralls take their turns immediately before or after your turn each round (your choice). All your thralls collectively share one reaction and bonus action, which a single thrall can use each round.
	Thralls use your spell attack modifier to make their attacks.

Maximum Thralls:
You can animate and control one thrall of challenge rating (CR) 1/4. As you gain levels in this class, you can animate more thralls. The combined CR of all your thralls can't exceed the number shown in the Thrall CR Total column of the Necromancer table, and the total number of thralls under your control can never exceed your proficiency bonus.
	At any time, you can use your action to sever your connection to one or more thralls, releasing them. Corporeal Undead crumple into a heap and incorporeal Undead flee to the Ethereal Plane.

Animate Dead:
Beginning at 5th level, a necromancer can learn the animate dead spell, a staple of the school of necromancy. Necromancers can cast this spell as an action, instead of over the course of 1 minute.
	All Undead created by the animate dead spell (as well as any other magic, such as the create undead spell, that allows you to control Undead) count as your thralls and can be commanded as such. If your new thralls granted to you by a spell cause you to exceed your total CR or number of thralls, you can immediately sever your connection to any of your existing thralls so as to stay within these limits. Your thralls can never command or create other Undead.
	As always, you can't reanimate Undead that have been reduced to 0 hit points. Your Animate Thralls ritual, the animate dead spell, and similar magic only affects Humanoid corpses, whereas your thralls are Undead creatures.

Undead Thralls:
Necromancers use the following creatures as their thralls: bonebeasts, gorgers, gravetouched ghouls, skeletons, spirits, visages, and zombies. Unless otherwise stated, no other Undead creatures can be animated as thralls. A Small or Medium Humanoid corpse can be animated into any of these Undead. Other than having a different size, your thralls' statistics are unchanged.
	A corpse can become a gorger, gravetouched ghoul, or zombie. A pile of bones can become a bonebeast or skeleton. The corpse of a creature that has been dead for no more than 1 hour can become a spirit or visage.

Many Thralls:
When you have three or more thralls under your command of the same type, you can roll a single attack on a particular target for all your thralls, instead of rolling attacks separately. If this attack hits, you treat all your thralls as having hit; if this misses, all your thralls' attacks miss. Thralls with different Action statistics and those that make attacks against different targets must roll separately.

      <feature>
        <name>Bag of Bones</name>
        <text>Also at 2nd level, you learn how to create a necromantic magic item, a bag of bones. The bag connects to a vast extradimensional space that can only hold Medium or smaller corpses, bones, and Undead creatures; it violently expels anything else placed within it. You can use an action to place a corpse or willing Undead creature into the bag, up to a maximum of ten corpses or Undead creatures, or use your action to dump the contents of the bag, which land in spaces within 5 feet of you.
	You can transform any container you can carry into a bag of bones by performing a special ritual over the course of 1 hour while you hold it. This container ceases to be magical if you perform this ritual again to create a new bag of bones. The container always connects to the same extradimensional space. If the bag is placed inside an extradimensional space, such as that created by a bag of holding, it is destroyed. Its contents remain in the same extradimensional space until you create a new bag.

        <text>Becoming a necromancer is seldom an accident. Almost all who dive into the secrets of life and death do so with a purpose, a method to the madness. This ambition is what drives them into the tenebrous corners of forgotten libraries, long abandoned tombs, and the graveyards of simple commoners. Ambition drives them further into the dark, where only the light of their end goal can lead them through the all-consuming shadows. A necromancer's grave ambition represents the path to their ultimate goal, the lengths they'll go to achieve it, and a source of justification for their actions, if only to themselves.

When you reach 3rd level, you decide on a proper path of research into the dark arts in order to carve a path leading toward your ultimate goal. Choose a Grave Ambition, detailed at the end of the class. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 20th level.

        <name>Lichdom</name>
        <text>By 20th level, you have unlocked the pinnacle of necromantic prowess, through which you will conquer death itself: The Rite of Lichdom. When you reach this level, you have completed your phylactery and are ready to undergo the rite. To do so, you shut yourself away for 30 days in an isolated location of your choice, and emerge as an immortal lich, an undead of unsurpassed power. Once the rite is complete, you gain the following benefits as well as those dictated by your choice of Grave Ambition.

Phylactery:
A phylactery is an object that houses a lich's soul, safeguarding its immortality. If you drop to 0 hit points, your body crumbles to dust, but your soul escapes to the phylactery. After 1d4 + 1 days, a new body coalesces as near to your phylactery as possible and you return to life (or rather, unlife). When your body reforms, you gain the benefits of a long rest. The new body is identical to the one that was destroyed.

Undead Resilience:
You have immunity to necrotic and poison damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition.

Undead Traits:
You are immune to the effects of exhaustion and you don't need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe. You must still rest for 4 hours to gain the benefits of a long rest. Though your type is Humanoid, spells and effects that specifically affect Undead affect you as well. You are immune to any effect that turns Undead.

Phylactery:
A lich's phylactery is as much a memento as it is their anchor to immortality, and as such, no two are alike. Phylacteries are often constructed from objects with sentimental value, such as family heirlooms or prized possessions, but can be fashioned from swords, pieces of armor, or even entire castles.
	Furthermore, every phylactery has a weakness, a critical flaw by which it can be destroyed, allowing its lich to be slain permanently. These weaknesses, too, are unique to each phylactery.
	One phylactery might require a ritual to be performed around it for 24 hours, while another might call for the phylactery to be dipped in the lava of an active volcano. Discuss with your GM the form your phylactery takes and what weakness it possesses.

Mist. You transform into a Medium cloud of mist. While in mist form, you can't speak, manipulate objects or take any actions, other than to revert to your true form. You are weightless, have a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter and occupy the space of another creature.

You are permanently weakened until you spend 24 hours resting in the coffin. During this time, your hit point maximum is reduced to 1, and you drop to 0 hit points if you begin your turn in sunlight.

Your flesh and bone rapidly decay, reducing your features to nothing more than two glowing dots beneath your hood. You gain the following features in addition to the Lichdom feature:

Immortal Rule. If you drop to 0 hit points, you can choose to possess a nearby body, instead of beginning the process of reforming at your phylactery. When you do so, choose an unconscious Humanoid or the corpse of one that has died within the last minute that is within 120 feet of you to possess (a creature warded by a protection from evil and good or magic circle spell can't be possessed).
	Once you possess a body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. If the body has 0 hit points when you possess it, its type becomes Undead and it regains 50 hit points, up to its hit point maximum. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can't use any of its class features.
	If you possess the body of an unconscious creature, the creature makes a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC after 8 hours, and it repeats the save every 8 hours thereafter until the effect ends. On a success, you are ejected from the body and begin the process of reforming at your phylactery. You are also ejected if the body dies or you choose to leave it as an action. Once you've possessed a creature in this way, you can't possess it again using this feature.

Tyrant's Influence. You can expend 25 points from your Charnel Touch pool to cast the spell dominate beast without expending a spell slot. You can also expend 30 points to cast the spell dominate person, or 60 points to cast the spell dominate monster without expending a spell slot.

When the need for superiority drives a necromancer, there is no end to their ambition. Such necromancers, known as pale masters, work feverishly to master every corner of necromantic magic, less out of the desire to improve themselves and more out of spite for their rivals.
	This perhaps speaks to a dirty secret of necromancy: most necromancers hate each other. Bitter rivalries, grudges, and insignificant slights motivate pale masters to embrace lichdom with unequaled fervor, for to master necromancy means to accept no equals.

The god-kings of ancient kingdoms practiced a unique style of necromancy, forgotten to time. Through the extraction of organs, the desiccation of flesh, and innumerable enchantments, those ancient kings were able to rule their subjects as divine, undead beings, long past their mortal deaths. While those kingdoms have been lost to the shifting sands and wild jungles of the world, their methods have been preserved in the carvings of colossal temples and revived by modern necromancers, who take on the guise of the erstwhile pharaohs.

        <text>At 3rd level, you can fade from view like a specter of death. When you hit with a Charnel Touch attack and expend 5 or more points, you become invisible until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if you move 15 feet or more.

        <text>Beginning at 6th level, as an action, you can flatten your body into a shadow upon the floor.
	As a shadow, your movement speed doubles and you gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed. You can move across difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. As a shadow, you can only move along surfaces; you can't jump or fly.
	Attacks against you have disadvantage while you are in shadow form. In darkness, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness.
	As a shadow, you can't take actions. Your equipment merges with your shadow form and has no effect until you leave the form.
	You can end this effect as a bonus action or when you start your turn (no action required).

        <text>At 20th level, you have reached the pinnacle of necromancy and transformed yourself into a lich. You have become an embodiment of death itself, a harbinger of the ultimate end. Clad in shadows, you seem little more than a grim skeletal presence in a foreboding robe, a sight which all men fear to behold.

Death's Touch. When you use your Charnel Touch against a creature you can see and roll an 11 or higher on the d20 for the attack roll, you hit the target, regardless of its AC.

Fell Flight. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet.

Grim Harvest. When you kill a Humanoid using Charnel Touch, you rip their soul from their body, which animates as a visage under your control, which counts as one of your thralls.

	You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your unarmed strikes made using your teeth or claws. If you hit with them, you deal damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (as appropriate to the attack roll), instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Your claws deal slashing damage and take up the Arms slot, whereas your teeth deal piercing damage and take up the Head slot.

You have installed the mighty source of breath weapons into yourself, and as an action on your turn, you can exhale a wave of energy.

On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 damage for each point of your proficiency bonus, or half as much damage on a successful one. The breath weapon's damage type is the same as the donor's breath weapon.

Donor: Dragon of Large size or larger
Slot: External

You've transplanted the scaly, diamond-like hide of a Dragon onto your body. While you aren't wearing armor, this natural armor provides you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.
	You also gain resistance to one of the following damage types to which the donor dragon was immune: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage. You can only install this graft if you are proficient with heavy armor.

Slot: Head

You attach a sturdy pair of horns or tusks onto your body, which are a natural weapon that you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Your horns deal the same type of damage as the donor (usually bludgeoning or piercing damage).
	Additionally, if you move in a straight line for 10 feet immediately before hitting a creature with your horns, that creature must make a Strength check contested by your Strength check. If you succeed, the creature is knocked prone.

Donor: Any
Slot: Any

One or more of your organs or limbs have been replaced with a part harvested from a monster. A replacement can effectively solve any amputation or organ failure, but they can't return to life someone that has died; such work is solely the domain of necromancy. Replacement limbs can resemble the original limb or can demonstrate obvious monstrous characteristics, depending on the donor. A replacement organ or limb takes up one body slot relevant to it; for example, a troll's hand takes the Arms slot and a replacement kidney takes up the Internal slot.
