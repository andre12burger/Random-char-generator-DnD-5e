    <text>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
	This weapon has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn. As part of your Attack action, you can expend a charge to create and load a piece of radiant ammunition into the crossbow. This bolt deals an extra 1d6 damage on a hit and deals radiant damage, instead of its normal piercing damage.
	Additionally, as an action, you can expend 3 charges to load a blinding bolt of light into the crossbow and fire it at a point you can see within 60 feet, where it detonates in a flash. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn. Motes of light hang in the air around that point for the next minute, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.</text>

	If you use this weapon to hit a creature that is under the effect of a spell, one spell of your choice affecting the target is dispelled if it is 5th-level or lower, and the target takes an extra 1d8 force damage for the level of the dispelled spell (dispelled cantrips deal no extra damage). Once a spell is dispelled, roll a d6. If the number is less than or equal to the level of dispelled spell, the sword loses this trait until the following dawn.</text>

    <text>This magical armor has 3 charges. When you are subjected to a magical effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you can expend a charge to instead take no damage on a success and only half as much damage on a failure. The armor regains all expended charges at dusk.
	Additionally, while you are attuned to this armor and wearing it, acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage you take from magical sources, as well as magical healing you receive, is reduced by 3. When you take damage from a magical melee weapon, the attacker must roll a d20. On a 10 or lower, the weapon's magic is suppressed for 1 hour, causing it to temporarily become nonmagical.</text>

    <text>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
	As an action, you launch a radiant, magical bolas from the weapon, directed at a creature within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and restrained by the bolas. A Huge or larger creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw. A restrained creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, breaking the bolas and freeing itself on a success. Each time a creature fails this check, the bolas tightens, dealing 1d8 radiant damage to the restrained creature.
	When you launch a bolas, roll a d6. On a 1 or 2, it can't be used to do so again until the following dawn.</text>

    <text>This magic weapon has 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 charges daily at dawn. As a bonus action, you can expend a charge to cause a thorny arrow to grow from the bow, choosing whether it is a Bramblestrike or Splinterstrike arrow. You can also spend three charges as an action to fire an Overgrowth Volley.

Bramblestrike: On a hit, this magic arrow deals the weapon's normal damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or become restrained by magical vines for up to 1 minute. A restrained creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself on a success.

Splinterstrike: On a hit, this magic arrow deals the weapon's normal damage, and then erupts in a storm of splinters and thorns. Each creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 piercing damage.

Overgrowth Volley: Three thick-limbed, thorny arrows grow from the bow and fire at a point you choose that you can see within 120 feet of you. Where the arrows land, a mass of syklthorn brambles grow, creating an effect identical to the wall of thorns spell, dealing 4d8 damage instead of 7d8.</text>
