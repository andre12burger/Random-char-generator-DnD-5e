    <text>A yklwa (pronounced YICK-ul-wah) is a simple melee weapon that is the traditional weapon of Chultan warriors. A yklwa consists of a 3-foot wooden shaft with a steel or stone blade up to 18 inches long. Although it has the thrown weapon property, the yklwa is not well balanced for throwing.

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When this weapon reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature doesn't die. Instead, infernal runes appear as if carved into their flesh and they're healed to 1 hit point. They now have the paralyzed condition until the condition is removed by a Lesser Restoration spell or similar magic. When the condition is removed, the runes disappear. At the start of each of their turns while they're paralyzed, the creature suffers immense pain and gains a level of exhaustion.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, yklwa
