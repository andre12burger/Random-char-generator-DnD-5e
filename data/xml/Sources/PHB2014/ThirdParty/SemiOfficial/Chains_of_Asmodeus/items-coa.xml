    <text>Your armor, weapons, and other equipment always shine as if just polished. Even if you're wounded, your wounds do not appear to others. You're immune to the frightened and poisoned conditions, as these would otherwise ruin your elegant appearance. However, whenever you would otherwise have been affected by one of these conditions, a random non-evil Humanoid on the Material Plane whom you have previously met gets the condition instead. You know this.

When transferring exhaustion, move all your exhaustion levels. If the chosen ally is immune to a transferred condition, the transfer fails.

    <text>When you die, you're transported to an extradimensional space where you're stabilized at 0 hit points and kept in that state. The amulet creates a perfect copy of your corpse and places it where you were just before you died, but without any of your worn or carried items. After 24 hours, you regain 1 hit point and are returned to the location of your neardeath. Everything about you is the same, except that your facial features are entirely different from before. Only a Wish spell can restore your true identity. Until then, you have disadvantage on any Charisma (Persuasion) checks to attempt to reveal who you really are.

Curse: An Identify spell or similar reveals only that the amulet can prevent death. Once you attune to the amulet, you can't describe its ability to any other creature, and if unattuned, you immediately forget what the amulet does. A Remove Curse spell reveals the details of the curse but does not remove it from the amulet.

If you ever decline an opportunity to better yourself financially at another's expense, you immediately take 3d10 necrotic damage. Only the Remove Curse spell allows you to end attunement to this item.

Curse: You're unwilling to part with this weapon while attuned to it. You're also vulnerable to radiant damage and each time you receive magical healing, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the healing has no effect. Only the Remove Curse spell allows you to end attunement to this item.

Corrupting: This item corrupts. See the "Infernal Item Corruption" section.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

While furious, you can't cast spells, can't verbally communicate, and are immune to the charmed and frightened conditions. Each time you deal damage, you regain 2d8 hit points and may immediately remove a condition you currently suffer from or end this fury. Additionally, while in this fury, you may spend a spell slot before you make a melee attack. Doing so causes the attack to deal an extra 3 (1d6) necrotic damage per level of spell slot expended, if the attack hits. Once used you may not use this fury again until you finish a short or long rest.

You can steadily improve this space, but only be denying such beauty to the rest of the world.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>The Accounting and Valuation of All Things is bound in gold leaf, with pages of silver and text of blood. This is a magic tome that functions as a spellbook and arcane focus. You have a +3 bonus to your spell attack and spell save DC.

Random Properties: The Accounting and Valuation of All Things has the following random properties:

	• 1 major beneficial property
	• 1 major detrimental property

The Soul Trade: One section of the book is dedicated to negotiating and valuing mortal souls. When the book is opened within 10 feet of a creature with a soul, that creature must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the tome analyzes their greatest desires and calculates exactly what they would need to give up their soul. That information is then displayed within the tome, such that the user can offer a trade to acquire a soul. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw simply show up as a question mark in the book's pages and are immune to further valuations.

Mammon's Tax: When the Accounting and Valuation of All Things is used as a spellbook, it maintains a unique ability to forcibly acquire souls. Any creature killed by a spell transcribed within the book has their soul ripped from their body and sent to Minauros. This process renders the subject immune to all forms of resurrection aside from True Resurrection. In payment for their soul, Mammon drops gold equal to (20 x CR) or (2 x Level) on their corpse.

Negotiation Tactics: The tome is capable of providing some assistance to all negotiations, not just those made for souls. You gain a passive +5 to Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to barter. Additionally, as an action, you can surrender your consciousness to the tome, allowing it to take over. For 1 minute, the Accounting and Valuation of All Things speaks for you, using a +12 Charisma (Persuasion) skill and gaining advantage on your rolls. Using the book in this manner has a corrupting influence, and each use compels you to become increasingly greedy, vain, and evil—much like its original owner, Mammon. When the duration ends, if your alignment is non-evil, you suffer 6d6 necrotic damage.

Transcribed Spells: The spellbook section of the Accounting and Valuation of All Things comes with some spells already recorded. For each spell level, roll (1d4-1). The DM will determine the necessary spells of each level that already exist within the tome. If you copy spells from the tome to your own spellbook, the cost in gold is doubled. On the opposite end, copying spells from your spellbook to the tome only costs half the gold it normally would.

Destroying the Tome: Destroying the Accounting and Valuation of All Things can be done in two ways. The first option is a simple bribe to Mammon to have him destroy the tome. An offering of 99,999 gp must be made, at midnight, by opening the book and placing the gold inside. If Mammon accepts the offering, the gold melts around the book, then both vanish.
	The second route, in case Mammon is unavailable or unwilling, is to incinerate the book. To accomplish this task, a pot of platinum (valued at no less than 99,999 gp) must be melted, enough to fully submerge the book. Once the platinum is prepared, dropping the tome into the molten solution melts the tome. The process completely destroys the tome, as well as the platinum.

    <text>When Fierna was born, petitioners and devils from all over came to celebrate her birth. Many brought gifts and treasures, including a powerful infernal warlock. Recognizing the strength and inner fire of Fierna, the warlock gifted her with the Amulet of the Inferno, and it has been around her neck ever since.

The Amulet of the Inferno is a magic necklace that grants a +3 bonus to spell save DC and spell attack bonus.

Random Properties: The Amulet of the Inferno has the following random properties:

	• 3 major beneficial properties
	• 2 major detrimental properties

Infernal Fire: While worn, the amulet augments any magical flames created by you, transforming normal fire into Hellfire. Hellfire ignores resistances and immunities to fire damage and deals double damage to creatures vulnerable to either fire or necrotic damage. It is also capable of melting stone, as well as igniting flammable objects.

Raging Inferno: While attuned to the Amulet of the Inferno, you may use a bonus action to cast Fire Bolt or Produce Flame. The cantrips scale based on your total character level and use Intelligence as a spellcasting modifier if you're normally incapable of casting spells.

Everburning: The Amulet of the Inferno grants resistance to cold damage and the ability to breathe underwater. Any magical flames you conjure are similarly augmented: they can be used underwater, can't be extinguished through any means, and can exude any temperature. While the casting of a fire spell can still be interrupted with Counterspell, once the spell has been cast, any lingering flames can't be removed.

Destroying the Amulet: The only creature capable of destroying the amulet is the warlock that created it. Nobody living knows the warlock's identity, making destroying the amulet almost impossible.

    <text>Forged of infernal iron and Hellfire through the help of Dispater, the Ranseur of Torture has been Belial's weapon of choice since he first became an archdevil. It is so directly tied to him that one of his worshipped symbols is a two-pronged fork. The weapon never leaves his side, and he is a master at wielding it.

The Ranseur of Torture is a magic pike. You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and it does 2d10 piercing damage instead of its regular damage. When you hit a good aligned creature with it, that creature takes an extra 1d10 necrotic damage.

Random Properties: The Ranseur of Torture has the following random properties:

	• 1 minor beneficial property
	• 1 major beneficial property
	• 1 minor detrimental property

Wounding: Damage dealt by the Ranseur of Torture is particularly dangerous, as it can only be restored through magical means. Resting, food, and medicine won't restore hit points removed by the pike. If the damage goes untreated for 7 days, the missing hit points are permanently removed, and can be recovered only through casting a Regenerate or Wish spell on the victim.

Execution: If a creature with less than its full hit points is hit by this pike, the Ranseur of Torture deals 1d10 additional piercing damage. If a creature is killed by the pike, their soul is sent to Phlegethos and can be restored only through casting a Wish spell on the victim.

Staggered: Each time a creature takes damage from the Ranseur of Torture, they must make a Constitution save, with a DC equaling the damage they took. On a failed save, their movement speed is reduced by 5 feet until the end of their next turn. This penalty stacks, though movement speed can't be reduced below 0.

Interrupting: Spellcasters damaged by the Ranseur of Torture have disadvantage on Constitution checks made to maintain concentration until the damage is healed. If a creature is concentrating on a spell when damaged by the ranseur, their concentration is immediately ended.

Destroying the Ranseur: Only through the written consent of both Dispater and Belial can the Ranseur of Torture be destroyed. If either or both of the archdevils are dead, then the new arch-devil to take their mantle must give permission in their stead. The two writs must be wrapped around each of the prongs of the weapon, then the weapon must be tossed into the Pit of Flame. If performed successfully, the Hellfire briefly burns a different hue.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Asmodeus's Ruby Rod is said to have been constructed from a shard of pure evil, a ruby soaked in the blood of the innocents, the drool from a draconic deity, and the tears of 777 angels. It is a magic rod that functions as a morningstar and you have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. All damage dealt with it is converted to necrotic, and when you hit a good aligned creature, that creature takes an extra 2d12 necrotic damage.
	The Ruby Rod of Asmodeus has 66 charges and regains 6d6 charges each nightfall. Asmodeus is always capable of perceiving through the rod and knows the exact location of any creature attuned to it. If a creature uses the special abilities of the rod without Asmodeus's permission, they take 2d12 necrotic damage each use, doubled if they're good aligned. This damage ignores resistances and immunities, and if it kills the user, Asmodeus permanently claims their soul.

Random Properties: The Ruby Rod of Asmodeus has the following random properties:

	• 1 minor beneficial property
	• 1 major beneficial property
	• 2 major detrimental properties

Asmodeus is immune to the detrimental properties of the weapon.

Bow to the King: You may use an action to expend 33 charges to use the rod to force all creatures within a 150-foot-radius to bow to you. A creature must succeed on a DC 21 Charisma saving throw or be forced to kneel for up to 1 hour. Creatures immune to the charmed condition have advantage on their save. Each time a kneeling creature takes damage, they may repeat the save, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends early for kneeling creatures if they're touched by the Ruby Rod.

Acid, Cold, and Lightning: At a cost of 9 charges each use, you may use an action to trigger one of the following effects:

	• You project acid in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12d8 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	• You project an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 12d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	• You shoot lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Reactions: As a reaction to suffering a detrimental effect, you may cast Lesser Restoration (expending 3 charges) or Greater Restoration (expending 12 charges.)
	Additionally, if you're the sole target of a spell, you may use a reaction to attempt to use the rod to absorb the spell and cancel its effect. You roll Scourge of ShadowRuby Rod of Asmodeus1d20 + 2, and if the result is higher than the spell level + 10, the spell is absorbed into the rod. The rod regains charges equal to the spell level it absorbed. If the absorbed charges go over the maximum of 66 charges, it overloads, dealing 1d6 necrotic damage per charge to you and expending all charges.

Destroying the Rod: While Asmodeus lives, the Ruby Rod of Asmodeus can't be destroyed, and if attempted it simply returns to Asmodeus. If he were defeated, the rod could be destroyed by bringing it to the Abyss from whence it was created, then performing a ritual known only to Asmodeus.

    <text>Said to be a gift to Glasya from Asmodeus, the Scourge of Shadow is a multi-headed whip constructed from infernal iron. The scourge is nigh-indestructible, and Glasya carries it with her wherever she goes. When she wields the whip in battle, it shrouds her in an aura of shadow.
	The Scourge of Shadow is a magic whip. You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and it does 3d4 slashing damage instead of its regular damage. When you hit a good aligned creature with it, that creatures takes an extra 4d4 necrotic damage.
	Whenever an unattuned creature attacks with the weapon, it deals 2d4 necrotic damage, ignoring resistances and immunities, to them, but otherwise functions normally.

Random Properties: The Scourge of Shadow has the following random properties:

	• 2 minor beneficial properties
	• 1 major beneficial property
	• 2 minor detrimental properties
	• 1 major detrimental property

Keen: The whip scores a critical on a roll of 18, 19, or 20. When it scores a critical, its damage dice are upgraded to 3d6 instead of 3d4 for the duration of the attack. If attacking a good aligned creature, or attacking with the weapon unattuned, the necrotic damage dice are also increased to a d6 instead of a d4.

Fast Reflexes: While attuned to the Scourge of Shadow, you gain advantage on initiative rolls, and you add your Charisma and Dexterity modifiers to the roll. You may use either your Strength, Dexterity, or Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls (the same modifier must be used for both attack and damage).

Veil of Shadow: You're protected by a field of shadow that makes you resistant to radiant and necrotic damage. While in dim light or darkness you gain blindsight out to 60 feet and Dexterity (Stealth) checks are made with advantage.

Destroying the Scourge: Though the process is known only to Glasya and Asmodeus, the Scourge of Shadow can be destroyed. It must be taken to the Pit of Fire in Phlegethos. The scourge, along with the body of an archdevil, must be thrown into the Hellfire together. As they hit the flames, a spell of Darkness must be cast at 9th level on the scourge. If each part of the ritual is performed correctly, the whip disintegrates within the Hellfire.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

    <text>Crafted from the very glacier in which he was imprisoned, the True-Ice Shards are a rapier and parrying dagger (main gauche) pair used by Levistus. They exemplify his time spent in the glacier, augmenting telepathy, divination, and defense. Due to his control over ice, Levistus can conjure the True-Ice Shards from anywhere, including if they were destroyed.
	You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the magical rapier and it does 1d8 cold damage instead of its regular damage. When using the magic dagger, you gain a +3 bonus to your AC, as long as it is used as your offhand weapon, and it does 1d6 cold damage instead of its regular damage. Because Levistus conjures the True-Ice Shards at will, he often rewards a copy of the artifact to his most loyal followers. The copies are identical to the original with one exception: Levistus can destroy or retrieve a copy at any time.

Random Properties: The True-Ice Shards have the following random properties:

	• 2 major beneficial properties
	• 2 minor detrimental properties
	• 1 major detrimental property

Sub-Zero: Cold damage dealt with the shards ignores resistances and immunities. Creatures vulnerable to cold damage take triple damage from the True-Ice Shards, rather than double. After you damage a creature with the shards, you may use a bonus action to force the creature to make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature that took the damage becomes vulnerable to cold damage for 24 hours. Once you use this feature, you may not use it again until after you have finished a long rest.

The Best Defense: As a reaction to being attacked, you use the rapier to increase your defense, adding +3 to your AC until the end of your next turn. If you attack with the rapier before the end of your next turn, you do not have its +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

Mental Command: While attuned to the True-Ice Shards, you can use an action to cast the Detect Thoughts spell (save DC 20), targeting any creature you have previously met. If the targeted creature is on a different plane of existence, the spell fails. As long as you maintain concentration, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to the focused creature. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—as long as the focus and concentration continue.

Omniscient: You can use the True-Ice Shards to cast a variety of divination spells. Locate Animals or Plants, Locate Creature, and Locate Object may be cast at will, and don't have a maximum range. Other limitations of the spells still apply, and they can't detect subjects on other planes of existence. Additionally, you may cast Scrying (with a spell save DC of 20) and Find the Path. Once either spell is cast, you must finish a long rest before casting either of them again.

Destroying the Shards: While Levistus still lives, destroying the True-Ice Shards serves little purpose, as he is capable of recreating them at will. That aside, the shards can be destroyed when subjected to a sufficient source of heat. A few such sources include the inside of an active volcano, a continuous source of Hellfire, or a powerful fire spell cast at 9th level.

    <text>Constructed from the same materials as his tower, Dispater's Wrought-Iron Tower is a powerful weapon that marks his rule over Dis. It embodies his ideals, representing defense, authority, and power. Its construction changes hourly, similar to the tower, appearing as either iron, steel, lead, or adamantine.
	The Wrought-Iron Tower is a magic staff that functions as a warhammer and you have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. If a creature is vulnerable to a certain type of damage, all damage dealt with the staff is converted to that damage type. When you hit a good aligned creature with it, that creature takes an extra 3d6 fire damage.
	While holding the staff, you can control and navigate through the Iron Tower in Dis. While the staff is on the layer of Dis, Dispater knows the exact location of it, and is capable of teleporting to within 30 feet of it at will.

Random Properties: The Wrought-Iron Tower has the following random properties:

	• 2 minor beneficial properties.

The Best Offense: While attuned to the staff, you have a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to all saving throws.

Additionally, the staff has 10 charges. When you make an attack, you may spend 1 or more charges. For each charge spent, you deal an additional 2 fire damage on a successful attack. Charges are still consumed if the attack misses. The staff regains all charges each day at dawn.

After dealing damage with the staff, you may use a bonus action and expend 1 charge to replace the damage dealt with your total AC instead.

Rulership: The Wrought-Iron Tower also functions as a Rod of Rulership, with an increased save DC of 18. This property costs 3 charges to use, though a creature that successfully saves against one of its uses is immune to future uses for 24 hours.

Slag: You can cast Searing Smite at 6th level on yourself, expending 1 charge. Instead of doing fire damage, you may have Searing Smite inflict acid damage. The spell requires no concentration and lasts for 1 minute.

Destroying the Staff: The Wrought-Iron Tower can only be destroyed inside the Iron Tower on Dis. Located somewhere within the tower is the forge that Dispater used to create the staff. An attuned creature must place the staff into the forge fires, then cast Dispel Evil and Good and touch the staff. They then take 20d10 fire damage, which ignores resistance and immunities. If the attuned creature survives the fire damage, the staff is destroyed.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
