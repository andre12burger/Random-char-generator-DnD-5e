        <name>Divine Domain: Ambition Domain</name>
        <text>"The worthy shall strive for greatness—supremacy in life leads to supremacy in the afterlife."

Bontu has fully embraced this dictum, and though she expends little effort in teaching it, she surely leads by example. Her viziers subtly plant the seeds that flower into the ambition the God-Pharaoh desires. Through insinuation, they remind acolytes and initiates alike that achieving one's place in the afterlife at the expense of others is not shameful, but is proof of the initiate's determination and drive. Nothing is more important than that drive, they suggest—not the bonds of a crop, not friendship or love. Not even devotion to a deity.

At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

Ambition Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1st | bane, disguise self
3rd | mirror image, ray of enfeeblement
5th | bestow curse, vampiric touch
7th | death ward, dimension door
9th | dominate person, modify memory

        <name>Warding Flare (Ambition Domain)</name>
        <text>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you can interpose divine light between yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity (Ambition Domain)</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate of yourself. As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.
	For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Cloak of Shadows (Ambition Domain)</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to vanish. As an action, you become invisible until the end of your next turn. You become visible if you attack or cast a spell.

Invisible:
	• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.

        <text>"The worthy shall cultivate a nimble mind that can perceive the wonders beyond imagination that wait in the afterlife."

Kefnet's task is to pass on this teaching of the God-Pharaoh and elucidate its meaning. He teaches that the afterlife will be inhabited only by those who have proved by their wits that they are worthy of dwelling in the glorious presence of the God-Pharaoh. He trains acolytes and initiates to push their limits and challenge their mental capacity with spells of ever-greater power.

Kefnet's domain is identical to the Knowledge domain in the Player's Handbook.

        <name>Divine Domain: Solidarity Domain</name>
        <text>"The worthy must know and respect all others whom the God-Pharaoh deems worthy, for in the afterlife, all will be united in purpose and action."

Oketra is charged with expounding upon this teaching of the God-Pharaoh, instilling in every initiate the virtue of solidarity. She forges each group of children into a crop of acolytes with just one purpose: to be judged worthy of a glorious afterlife. And she instills in each crop the ability to unite in a single action in pursuit of that purpose. She is fond of poetic imagery to communicate her ideals.

Domain Spells:
At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

Solidarity Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1st | bless, guiding bolt

        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured. As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Divine Domain: Strength Domain</name>
        <text>"The worthy shall hone a strong body that can withstand the boundless energies of the afterlife."

It falls to Rhonas to instill this teaching in those who would enter the afterlife—but to his mind, the words themselves don't matter. Strength can't be taught. It must be built through practice and training. Rhonas demonstrates his teachings by his example, rather than by giving his students any kind of academic instruction. He welcomes the people of Naktamun to stand by the Hekma and watch him as he storms into the desert to battle the greatest horrors. He encourages them to observe his indomitable strength, for though they will never equal it, they can aspire to mimicry. He invites them to scrutinize every move and practice what they see.

Strength Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1st | divine favor, shield of faith

The God-Pharaoh expects those he welcomes into the afterlife to desire it above all other pleasures and achievements, and for them to show their dedication, passion, and fervor through their actions. Hazoret is charged with cultivating this zeal in the initiates who come under her care, and she has undertaken the task with appropriate enthusiasm. She recognizes, however, that the best way to teach zeal is by demonstrating it.
