A ranged weapon similar to a sniper rifle.

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.
	The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger's Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 1d6.

"The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.
	Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade's creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.
	I have sought the blade's name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine."
	- Infernal Chancellor Lazivos's personal writings

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

	- Infernal Chancellor Lazivos's personal writings

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Explosive: Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.

A ranged weapon that is powerful at short range.

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.
	The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger's Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.
	You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 2d6. In addition, when you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can choose to regain a seal (no action required). Once you regain a seal in this way, you can't do so again until the following dusk.

"The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.
	Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade's creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.
	I have sought the blade's name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine."

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

A thrown weapon that explodes on impact, can be volatile. Deals Fire damage on hit.

	— Infernal Chancellor Lazivos's personal writings

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Explosive: Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

A thrown weapon that explodes on impact, can be volatile. Deals Fire damage on hit.

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Explosive: Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.
