    <name>Enhanced Regeneration (HB)</name>
    <prerequisite>Troll Race</prerequisite>
    <text>You've further developed your innate troll regeneration, making you even more difficult to kill. You gain the following benefits:

	• Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

	• You gain additional Troll Hit Die equal to your proficiency modifier. These hit die are d6s and can be used to regain hit points over a short rest just like your normal hit die. You can use your Troll Regeneration feature to regain health using Troll Hit Die without expending a use of that feature.
