This magic weapon has a dull, rusty color or has veins of ruidium running through it. While this weapon is on your person, you gain the following benefits:

	• You can breathe water.
	• You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

Ruidium Strike: A creature you hit with this weapon takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage.

Ruidium Corruption: When you roll a 1 on an attack roll made with this weapon, you must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. If you are not already suffering from ruidium corruption, you become corrupted when you fail this save.

If Ruidium Is Destroyed: If the Apotheon is killed or redeemed, all the ruidium in Exandria is destroyed instantly, and a ruidium weapon becomes a +2 weapon.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, light hammer

If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

When you roll a 1 or a 20 on a d20, roll another d20 to create a random effect. Each time you roll, the new effect replaces any previous effect. Unless otherwise stated, the weapon returns to its normal state when you finish a short or long rest.

Chaos Weapon Effects:
d20 | Effect
1 | Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.
2 | A spectral aura coats your weapon. Until the end of your next turn, whenever you hit with this weapon, it casts magic missile as a 1st-level spell.
3 | Until the end of your next turn, you have advantage on attack rolls with this weapon.
4 | You and all creatures within 30 feet of you gain vulnerability to slashing damage for the next minute.
5 | Your attacks with this weapon deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage.
6 | Your weapon casts entangle on the next creature you hit with it before the end of your next turn.
7 | Instead of rolling, treat the result of this weapon's damage dice as 1 until the end of your next turn.
8 | You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
9 | You gain a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
10 | You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
11 | You gain a -1 penalty to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
12 | You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
13 | You gain a -3 penalty to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

16 | Your attacks with this weapon deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage.
17 | You and all creatures within 30 feet of you gain vulnerability to bludgeoning damage for the next minute.
18 | You are surrounded by a faint, ethereal music for the next minute.
19 | A glorious blaze flashes across your weapon, then vanishes. Immediately after, your weapon casts fireball as a 3rd-level spell, centered on yourself.
20 | Roll twice on this table, gaining both effects.

    <text>This wooden broom functions like a mundane broom until you get angry enough to start knocking people over the head with it.

You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, when you're damaged by a creature in reach, you may use your reaction to make one melee attack against it with this weapon.

Curse: You're unwilling to part with this weapon while attuned to it. While attuned, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one.
	Whenever a hostile creature damages you, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action on each of your turns to attack the creature nearest to you with the weapon. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You're berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. Alternatively, an ally can use an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check and if successful, you're no longer berserk. Only the Remove Curse spell allows you to end attunement to this item.

Corrupting: This item corrupts. See the "Infernal Item Corruption" section.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When this weapon reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature doesn't die. Instead, infernal runes appear as if carved into their flesh and they're healed to 1 hit point. They now have the paralyzed condition until the condition is removed by a Lesser Restoration spell or similar magic. When the condition is removed, the runes disappear. At the start of each of their turns while they're paralyzed, the creature suffers immense pain and gains a level of exhaustion.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook.

The head of this bludgeoning weapon is made from a massive delerium crystal that crackles with arcane energies. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra (3d6) necrotic damage.
	When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, it unleashes an arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim). You can roll twice on the table and choose either result.

Arcane Anomalies:
1d20 | Arcane Anomalies
1 | Gravity breaks within a 100-foot radius area for 1 hour. Creatures levitate in midair, and must move by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows them to move as if they were climbing. Unattended objects float around randomly.
2 | The nearest creature is affected by a hideous laughter spell (Save DC 15) but instead of laughing, the creature repeats unfathomable combinations of syllables and words.
3 | Time skips a beat. Creatures within 60 feet experience a palpable feeling of vertigo followed by a powerful sensation of deja vu and are stunned for 1 round (No save).
4 | The nearest creature becomes unstuck in time. It is affected by the blink spell for 1 minute. Instead of vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, the creature vanishes into a sliver of time in its past or possible future.
5 | A prismatic burst of energy erupts in a 20-foot radius. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 radiant damage and become blinded for 1 round. The smell of ozone fills the area, and wood transforms into glass.
6 | Echoes of possible realities are briefly visible for 1 minute. When a creature within 60 feet is hit by an attack, a faint vision of the creature being killed by that attack appears.
7 | Discordant music fills the mind of all creatures within 30 feet, who are affected as if by irresistible dance (Save DC 15).
8 | A section of stone, water, air, or energy becomes an appropriate contaminated elemental.
9 | An extraplanar creature is summoned and remains for 1 hour. The DM either chooses the creature or determines it randomly. It is friendly to the creature who triggered the anomaly.
10 | All humanoid corpses within 120 feet animate as hostile haze husks. The shrieking undead beg frantically for forgiveness as they rip apart the living.
11 | The shadows of 1d6 random creatures in the area animate and try to kill them. Once destroyed, the creatures don't cast a shadow for 24 hours.
12 | All creatures within 60 feet become invisible for 1 min or until they attack or cast a spell.
13 | Tendrils of life flow from the nearest creature to others. It must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 8d8 necrotic damage, half on a success. The three nearest creatures within 60 feet each regain hit points equal to the damage taken.
14 | A hypnotic pattern (save DC 15) appears. It creates scintillating impossible colours in shapes which are simply wrong. Creatures incapacitated by the spell weep uncontrollably.
15 | A black tentacles spell appears in the area for 1 hour (Escape DC 15).
16 | Objects within 60 feet come to life for the next hour, as if affected by the animate objects spell. They mumble awful truths, but are not otherwise hostile.
17 | The nearest creature is polymorphed into an awakened shrub for 1 hour or until reduced to 0 hp (No save).
18 | Time slows down for up to six randomly determined creatures within 120 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the slow spell for 1 minute. (Save DC 15).
19 | Time speeds up for one randomly determined creature within 60 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the haste spell for 1 minute.
20 | A bowl of flowers and a very surprised aquatic mammal appear 100 feet in the air. "Oh no, not again..." thinks the flowers.

    <text>This wooden broom functions like a mundane broom until you get angry enough to start knocking people over the head with it.

The head of this bludgeoning weapon is made from a massive delerium crystal that crackles with arcane energies. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra (3d6) necrotic damage.
	When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, it unleashes an arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim). You can roll twice on the table and choose either result.

Arcane Anomalies:
1d20 | Arcane Anomalies
1 | Gravity breaks within a 100-foot radius area for 1 hour. Creatures levitate in midair, and must move by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows them to move as if they were climbing. Unattended objects float around randomly.
2 | The nearest creature is affected by a hideous laughter spell (Save DC 15) but instead of laughing, the creature repeats unfathomable combinations of syllables and words.
3 | Time skips a beat. Creatures within 60 feet experience a palpable feeling of vertigo followed by a powerful sensation of deja vu and are stunned for 1 round (No save).
4 | The nearest creature becomes unstuck in time. It is affected by the blink spell for 1 minute. Instead of vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, the creature vanishes into a sliver of time in its past or possible future.
5 | A prismatic burst of energy erupts in a 20-foot radius. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 radiant damage and become blinded for 1 round. The smell of ozone fills the area, and wood transforms into glass.
6 | Echoes of possible realities are briefly visible for 1 minute. When a creature within 60 feet is hit by an attack, a faint vision of the creature being killed by that attack appears.
7 | Discordant music fills the mind of all creatures within 30 feet, who are affected as if by irresistible dance (Save DC 15).
8 | A section of stone, water, air, or energy becomes an appropriate contaminated elemental.
9 | An extraplanar creature is summoned and remains for 1 hour. The DM either chooses the creature or determines it randomly. It is friendly to the creature who triggered the anomaly.
10 | All humanoid corpses within 120 feet animate as hostile haze husks. The shrieking undead beg frantically for forgiveness as they rip apart the living.
11 | The shadows of 1d6 random creatures in the area animate and try to kill them. Once destroyed, the creatures don't cast a shadow for 24 hours.
12 | All creatures within 60 feet become invisible for 1 min or until they attack or cast a spell.
13 | Tendrils of life flow from the nearest creature to others. It must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 8d8 necrotic damage, half on a success. The three nearest creatures within 60 feet each regain hit points equal to the damage taken.
14 | A hypnotic pattern (save DC 15) appears. It creates scintillating impossible colours in shapes which are simply wrong. Creatures incapacitated by the spell weep uncontrollably.
15 | A black tentacles spell appears in the area for 1 hour (Escape DC 15).
16 | Objects within 60 feet come to life for the next hour, as if affected by the animate objects spell. They mumble awful truths, but are not otherwise hostile.
17 | The nearest creature is polymorphed into an awakened shrub for 1 hour or until reduced to 0 hp (No save).
18 | Time slows down for up to six randomly determined creatures within 120 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the slow spell for 1 minute. (Save DC 15).
19 | Time speeds up for one randomly determined creature within 60 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the haste spell for 1 minute.
20 | A bowl of flowers and a very surprised aquatic mammal appear 100 feet in the air. "Oh no, not again..." thinks the flowers.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>This wooden broom functions like a mundane broom until you get angry enough to start knocking people over the head with it.

From the beak of the suneater owlbear is extracted its ability to absorb and redirect sunlight. The suneater's bones imbue this item with the hard-headed arrogance unique to fey that prevents them from succumbing to others' charms.
	While attuned to the suncatcher, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to resist being charmed.
	This weapon has 7 charges. It regains 1 expended charge for each hour it spends in direct sunlight and 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Radiant Absorption: When a creature within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage, you can use your reaction to spend 1 charge and absorb some of the energy. The damage the creature takes is reduced by 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum reduction of 1).

Radiant Deliverance: When you hit a target with a spell attack while holding the suncatcher, you can spend up to 3 charges to imbue the attack with radiant energy. On a hit, the attack deals an additional 1d6 radiant damage per charge expended.

Dreamcatcher: While attuned to the suncatcher, you are aware when a creature is using the dream spell to contact you and can choose to end the spell early.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

From the beak of the suneater owlbear is extracted its ability to absorb and redirect sunlight. The suneater's bones imbue this item with the hard-headed arrogance unique to fey that prevents them from succumbing to others' charms.
	While attuned to the suncatcher, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to resist being charmed.
	This weapon has 7 charges. It regains 1 expended charge for each hour it spends in direct sunlight and 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.
	You know the flare* and light cantrips. When you cast the flare cantrip, you have a +2 bonus to your attack and damage rolls for the spell.

Radiant Absorption: When a creature within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage, you can use your reaction to spend 1 charge and absorb some of the energy. The damage the creature takes is reduced by 3d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum reduction of 1).

Radiant Deliverance: When you hit a target with a spell attack while holding the suncatcher, you can spend up to 3 charges to imbue the attack with radiant energy. On a hit, the attack deals an additional 1d6 radiant damage per charge expended.

Dreamcatcher: While attuned to the suncatcher, you are aware when a creature is using the dream spell to contact you and can choose to end the spell early. You can expend 1 charge to cast the daydream spell or 4 charges to cast the blinding radiance spell from the suncatcher.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

The shapechanging abilities of the mimic infuse this musical instrument, a lute, with the propensity to subtly alter its shape and produce excellent acoustics. It also exudes a corrosive acid that can be a useful addition when the musician's plan to charm a foe with a sweet serenade doesn't go to plan.
	This magic weapon deals an additional 1d8 acid damage to the first target that it hits on a turn. If you have proficiency with lutes, you're considered proficient with this weapon as well.

Ventriloquism: As a bonus action while holding the lute, you can command it to mimic simple sounds it has been exposed to, such as a person whispering, swords clashing, or simple melodies. You can choose for the sounds to originate from any point within 30 feet of you that you can see. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

Club Music: As an action while holding the lute, you can play one of two brief but powerful songs. Once a song has been played, you can't play that song again until the next dawn.

	• 1. Panic! at the Tavern: You let loose a fast, chaotic melody that sows panic in the minds of your foes, forcing each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you that can hear you to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 psychic damage and is frightened of you for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	• 2. Mithrallica: You unleash an ear-shattering power chord that blows your foes away, forcing each creature in a 25-foot cone to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 thunder damage and is pushed 20 feet away from you, knocked prone, and deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the deafened condition on itself on a success.

Burning with ravenous hunger and unquenchable hanger, this mimic-infused weapon struggles relentlessly against the sturdy iron chains that bind it. Loosening the chains stimulates the weapon's digestive juices which, if not quenched, can have caustic consequences for its wielder.

Mimic Unleashed: As a bonus action while holding the hammer, you can loosen the chains restraining the mimic, leaving it free to mercilessly maul your foes. While the chains are loose, the hammer bites targets that it hits, dealing an extra 1d4 piercing damage.
	If you end your turn holding the hammer while the chains are loose, and you didn't hit a creature with an attack using the hammer that turn, the hammer's excess digestive juices pour down the handle and you take 1d4 acid damage. The chains tighten on their own if the hammer isn't held for 1 minute or if you use a bonus action to tighten the chains while holding the weapon.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet straight towards you. If the creature is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armor, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. Large or larger creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook.

This weapon is naturally attracted to foes bearing ferrous metals, allowing it to strike them with more force. Those who align themselves more closely with the weapon are granted the ability to manipulate gravity, telekinetically pulling creatures and objects into range of its jagged-faced swings.
	The weapon has a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. If the target is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armor, increase the bonus to +3.

Optional Attunement: If you choose to attune to this weapon, it gains the Attraction property. When you activate a property granted by this optional attunement, roll a d4. On a 1, haemstrike's optional attunement properties can't be activated until the next dawn.

OA: Attraction: As a bonus action, you can point haemstrike at a target you can see within 30 feet of you. If the target is an object that weighs less than 600 pounds, the object is pulled up to 15 feet towards you. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet straight towards you. If the creature is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armor, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. Huge or larger creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw.

OA: Magnetic Shockwave: Once per turn when you hit a target with haemstrike, you can cause an eruption of supercooled magnetite shards. Each creature other than you within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. Creatures made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armor have disadvantage on this saving throw.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Never has the saying "smash something into next week" been so apt. With an hourglass filled with brilliant platinum sand, this magical impact weapon utilises the dreamholder's command over time dilation to throw its victims forward in time.
	This weapon has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Chronal Blink: As a bonus action, you can twist the weapon's pommel, expending 1 charge and causing the sand to begin churning in defiance of gravity. The next creature you hit with an attack using this weapon within the next minute must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target disappears as it gets shunted forwards in time, reappearing in the space from which it disappeared, or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied, at the end of your next turn.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar's leverage can be applied.

Never has the saying "smash something into next week" been so apt. With an hourglass filled with brilliant platinum sand, this magical impact weapon utilises the dreamholder's command over time dilation to throw its victims forward in time.
	This weapon has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Chronal Blink: As a bonus action, you can twist the weapon's pommel, expending 1 charge and causing the sand to begin churning in defiance of gravity. The next creature you hit with an attack using this weapon within the next minute must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target disappears as it gets shunted forwards in time, reappearing in the space from which it disappeared, or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied, at the end of your next turn.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Chronal Blink: As a bonus action, you can twist the weapon's pommel, expending 1 charge and causing the sand to begin churning in defiance of gravity. The next creature you hit with an attack using this weapon within the next minute must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target disappears as it gets shunted forwards in time, reappearing in the space from which it disappeared, or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied, at the end of your next turn.

Detachable Eye: As an action, you can detach the eye from the centre of the weapon's shaft, placing it on a surface to which it adheres for the next hour. The eye relays a constant stream of visual information to the larger eye on the weapon, which transforms to become a screen through which you can view what the smaller eye can see. At the end of the hour, the smaller eye teleports back to the weapon. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

"Stab, bang, hope." If consulted, these are the instructions any kobold will give on using a gunnspier. With a lengthy reload time and complete lack of accuracy, this matchlock-augmented polearm is usable at only one range: point blank. It also comes with a lovely ribbon and a neat basket to hold all your spare shot. Cute.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Point Blank Shot: When you hit a target with an attack using a loaded gunnspier, you can use a bonus action to pull the trigger, firing a plum-sized leaden ball at the target. The attack deals an additional 2d8 bludgeoning damage. As an action, you can reload the gunnspier.

Backfire: When you use Point Blank Shot and roll an 8 on both of the additional bludgeoning damage dice, the gunnspier backfires. Each creature within 10 feet of you (including you) must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 piercing damage as shrapnel erupts from the weapon.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Forged as a pair, these magic weapons are crafted from the matching upper and lower jaw bones of a tarrasque. Their innate magic—and one of the reasons the tar-rasque's bite is so powerful—creates an arcanomagnetic pull between the two jawbones, dealing devastating damage to whatever lies between them.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with each of these magic weapons. These weapons deal piercing damage instead of their usual damage type.

Chomp: When you engage in two-weapon fighting using these two weapons and hit the same target with both weapons, the attack you make with your second weapon deals an additional 1d8 damage.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to a pair of jaw breakers. They count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. When you do so, the weapons gain the Swirling Dervish property while you are attuned to them.

OA: Swirling Dervish: Harnessing the power of the blades, you leap over a target, becoming a tornado of lacerating blades. As an action while you wield both jaw breakers, you can perform a magically-enhanced jump, attacking creatures you pass over. This jump has a maximum distance of 20 feet, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.
	For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp's extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack.

You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Forged as a pair, these magic weapons are crafted from the matching upper and lower jaw bones of a tarrasque. Their innate magic—and one of the reasons the tar-rasque's bite is so powerful—creates an arcanomagnetic pull between the two jawbones, dealing devastating damage to whatever lies between them.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with each of these magic weapons. These weapons deal piercing damage instead of their usual damage type.

Chomp: When you engage in two-weapon fighting using these two weapons and hit the same target with both weapons, the attack you make with your second weapon deals an additional 1d8 damage.

Optional Attunement: You can choose to attune to a pair of jaw breakers. They count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. When you do so, the weapons gain the Swirling Dervish property while you are attuned to them.

OA: Swirling Dervish: Harnessing the power of the blades, you leap over a target, becoming a tornado of lacerating blades. As an action while you wield both jaw breakers, you can perform a magically-enhanced jump, attacking creatures you pass over. This jump has a maximum distance of 20 feet, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.
	For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp's extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar's leverage can be applied.

Made from the claws, teeth, and bones of lycanthropes, these weapons are particularly effective against other lycanthropes or vampires. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
	Additionally, on a successful attack against a lycanthrope, the target is forced back into its human form unless it succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. Also, damage done to vampires with lycan weapons cannot be regenerated until the creature finishes a short rest.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon's hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon's breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.

Slumbering (Uncommon): Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.

Stirring (Rare): The Stirring weapon has the Slumbering property. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.

Wakened (Very Rare): The Wakened weapon has the Slumbering property, and it improves on the Stirring property. The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and the extra damage dealt by the weapon increases to 2d6.
	As an action, you can unleash a 30-foot cone of destructive energy from the weapon. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Ascendant (Legendary): The Ascendant weapon has the Slumbering property, and it improves on the Stirring and Wakened properties. The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3, and the extra damage dealt by the weapon increases to 3d6.
	The cone of destructive energy the weapon creates increases to a 60-foot cone, the save DC increases to 18, and the damage increases to 12d6.

    <text>A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook.

This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon's hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon's breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.
	Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, light hammer

	You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.
	As an action, you can unleash a 30-foot cone of destructive energy from the weapon. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, light hammer

	You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 3d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.
	As an action, you can unleash a 60-foot cone of destructive energy from the weapon. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>A common playing card from a deck of cards.

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.
	The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger's Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 1d6.

"The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.
	Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade's creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.
	I have sought the blade's name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine."
	- Infernal Chancellor Lazivos's personal writings

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

	I have sought the blade's name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine."
	— Infernal Chancellor Lazivos's personal writings

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>The scabbard where you store your sword in, wielded like a blunt weapon.

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.
	The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger's Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.
	You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 2d6. In addition, when you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can choose to regain a seal (no action required). Once you regain a seal in this way, you can't do so again until the following dusk.

"The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.
	Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade's creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.
	I have sought the blade's name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine."

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, light hammer

An armblade is a magic weapon that attaches to your arm, becoming inseparable from you as long as you're attuned to it. To attune to this item, you must hold it against your forearm for the entire attunement period.
	As a bonus action, you can retract the armblade into your forearm or extend it from there. While it is extended, you can use the weapon as if you were holding it, and you can't use that hand for other purposes.

This weapon is adorned with small black spikes that seem to soak up any blood that splashes across them. This acts as a +1 weapon and provides you with 1d8 temporary hit points whenever you reduce a Dragon, Giant, Humanoid or Monstrosity to 0 hit points.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, dart, playing card
