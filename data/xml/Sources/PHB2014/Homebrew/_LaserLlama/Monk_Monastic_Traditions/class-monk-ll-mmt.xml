        <name>Monastic Tradition: Alternate Four Elements (HB)</name>
        <text>The Way of the Four Elements was published in the Player's Handbook, and is widely considered to be one of the most unsatisfying subclasses in 5e. The Alternate Way of the Four Elements presented here is an attempt to bring this monk subclass up to par with other official Monastic Traditions.

Variant Rule: Spellcasting
The Alternate Way of the Four Elements presented here uses the warlock class, rather than the wizard, as the basis for its spellcasting abilities to better represent the raw power of nature. If you prefer more traditional spellcasting, use the progression found in the Eldritch Knight Fighter Archetype.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Disciple of the Elements (Alternate Four Elements (HB))</name>
        <text>You learn ancient monastic arts that allow you to cast spells:

Cantrips:
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Four Elements spell list at the end of this Tradition. You learn one additional Four Elements cantrip at 10th and 17th level.

Spell Slots:
The Four Elements Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of those slots. All of your spell slots are the same level. To cast a Four Elements spell of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You use the spell's casting time and other rules, but your body is the spellcasting focus for these spells, and you don't need to provide any material components. You regain expended Four Elements spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
	For example, at 7th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell burning hands, you must spend one of these Four Elements slots, and you cast it at 2nd-level.

Ki Casting:
You can draw upon your ki to regain your elemental powers. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a number of ki points equal to 1 + your Slot Level to regain one of your expended Four Elements spell slots.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Four Elements spell list at the end of this Tradition. The Spells Known column of the Four Elements Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the Slot Level column for your level.
	Whenever you gain a monk level, you can choose one Four Elements spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Four Elements spell list, which must be of a level for which you have Four Elements spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Four Elements spells, so you use Wisdom when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting a saving throw DC, and when making a spell attack roll.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of Ferocity (HB)</name>
        <text>While monks of every Tradition strive to master their physical form, creatures born with natural weapons; claws, horns, or teeth, have natural unarmed advantages when compared to other monks. Through the practice of this savage Tradition, creatures learn to leverage these physical advantages with secret techniques, and combine their mastery of ki with the ferocity that dwells within all creatures of bestial heritage.

Optional Rule: Race Restriction
The Way of Ferocity is typically practiced only by creatures of bestial ancestry. Only creatures with natural weapons, such as Lizardfolk, Tortles, Tabaxi, Minotaurs, Leonin, or other beastfolk can choose to follow this Monastic Tradition. Your table may lift this restriction to better suit your setting.

        <text>Your martial arts enhance your natural abilities with one of the disciplines below. Once chosen, this cannot be changed:

Bestial Rend:
This discipline is most often adopted by Monks with sharp claws and savage teeth. Your unarmed strikes deal slashing damage and inflict deep wounds. If you hit a target with an unarmed strike, its movement speed is reduced by a cumulative 5 feet until the start of your next turn. If this feature reduces its speed to 0, it has disadvantage on all Dexterity saving throws until the start of your next turn.

Natural Defenses:
This discipline is most often adopted by monks with an armored hide, scales, or shell. When a creature you can see hits you with an attack you can use a reaction to add one roll of your martial arts die to your Armor Class against the attack, possibly causing it to miss.

Savage Charge:
This discipline is most often adopted by monks with hooves or horns. If you move at least 15 feet in a straight line toward a creature, you have advantage on the first unarmed strike or monk weapon attack against that creature before the end of your turn.

Natural Resilience:
You can draw on your wellspring of mystic power to harden your defenses and shrug off assaults. Whenever a creature that you can see hits you with an attack, you can expend ki points (up to your Wisdom modifier) to reduce the damage by one roll of your martial arts die for each ki point spent.

Savage Rush:
You can channel a burst of primal speed to trample those in your path. As an action, you can spend 4 ki points and move up to your full walking speed in a straight line, and force any creature you pass through to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure they take bludgeoning damage equal to four rolls of your martial arts die and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half as much damage and are not knocked prone.
