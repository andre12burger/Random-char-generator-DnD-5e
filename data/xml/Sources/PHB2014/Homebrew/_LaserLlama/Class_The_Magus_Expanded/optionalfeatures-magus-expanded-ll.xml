    <text>You have trained extensively to counter sinister spellcasters and foil their arcane abilities. You gain the following benefits:

	• When you can see or hear a creature within the reach of a melee weapon you are wielding cast a spell, you can make an opportunity attack against it. On hit, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw as if it were doing so to maintain concentration. On a failure, its spell fails to take effect, and its slot or use of that ability is wasted.

	• If you damage a creature concentrating on a spell, it has disadvantage on its Constitution saving throw to maintain its concentration. This does not stack with the first bullet.

	• You have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by creatures you can see or hear within 5 feet of you.

    <prerequisite>the ability to cast at least one spell</prerequisite>
    <text>You have practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:

	• When you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can use a reaction to add your Spellcasting modifier (minimum of +0) to your roll.

	• You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or shields in one or both hands.

	• When you make an opportunity attack, you can cast a spell instead. It must have a casting time of 1 action or 1 attack, and this spell can only target that creature.

	• When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can cast a spell with a casting time of On Hit.

    <prerequisite>proficiency with a martial weapon</prerequisite>
    <text>You have trained to combine your minor magics with weapon attacks. You gain the benefits listed below:

	• Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score by 1, up to a maximum of 20.

	• You learn two Cantrips of your choice from the Magus spell list, choosing Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as your spellcasting ability for these Magus Cantrips.

	• At least one of these Cantrips must deal damage. Once on each of your turns when you make a melee weapon attack, you can imbue the magic of a Magus Cantrip you know into your attack. On hit, you do not deal the normal damage of the Cantrip along with the damage of your weapon attack. Instead, your weapon attack deals the damage type dealt by the Cantrip, and it applies the additional effects of the Cantrip on hit.
