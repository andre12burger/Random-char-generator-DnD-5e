      <name>Blood Hunter</name>
      <text>When the young man's blindfold was removed he found himself in a dimly lit room surrounded by hooded figures. He stood in front of a small dais that held a vial of gleaming crimson liquid. Months of training had led him to this moment. If he survived drinking the vial, the Hunter's Bane, he would never be the same. Becoming more than human, he would finally have the power to avenge his family that lay dead all these years.
	As the horde of demonic spawn lurched toward her, the aging half-elf ran her thin blade along her palm, coating it in her blood. In an instant, the blood ignited, wreathing her sword in a ghastly blue flame. She fell upon the horde as a blur of azure fire and cold steel. The hellspawn would find no mercy from her today.
	In the light of the pale moon, an almost feral halfling got down on all fours to sniff the tracks before him. The scent of goblin was unmistakable, vile rags and rotten meats. With a bestial howl, the halfling grew in size and wiry gray fur burst forth from his arms and legs. As fast as the wind, the halfling werewolf began another hunt in the light of the full moon.
	All of the strange and monstrous warriors described above are Blood Hunters, occult guardians who infect and inoculate their blood with accursed power so they may hunt monsters.

      <name>Self-sacrificing Hunters</name>
      <text>Blood Hunters have no formal hierarchy and their Orders are as varied as the curses they choose to bear, but they do hold one thing in common, the Hunter's Bane. Those who survive this ancient and deadly ritual are able to wield the signature sanguine magic that marks them as Blood Hunters.
	The makeup of this sinister ritual varies by Order and era, with each incorporating monstrous curses and magic which grant a Blood Hunter the unique abilities of their Order. This ritual permanently changes the subject, inoculating its blood with monstrous power at the expense of what makes them a normal mortal. Wherever monsters lurk, there also are Blood Hunters who have given up their chance at a mundane life so they may stalk and slay the vile creatures of darkness.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Ancient And Sinister Rites</name>
      <text>Wherever creatures of the darkness prowl, there are warriors who stand against them. Many Orders of Blood Hunters can trace their lineage back to ancient days. The blood magic they use is older than the divine magic of Clerics, and it serves asthe legacy of dark times when mortals were forced to fend for themselves. Though their blood magic is unsettling and grim in nature, many Blood Hunters place a great deal of pride in the ancient traditions, rituals, and rites of their Occult Order.</text>

      <name>Creating a Blood Hunter</name>
      <text>When creating a Blood Hunter, the most important thing to consider is why they would choose this accursed way of life. Were they the victim of a horrible monster attack and swore vengeance, no matter the personal cost? Were they trained from birth under the tutelage of an elder hunter, and forged into a relentless monster slayer? Or, were they recruited by a secretive society for their exceptional talent at hunting?

Quick Build:
You can make a Blood Hunter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Strength. Second, choose the Haunted One background. Finally, take the Versatile Fighting Style.</text>

        <name>Multiclass Blood Hunter</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose blood hunter as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a blood hunter.

	• Strength or Dexterity 13
	• Constitution 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a blood hunter.

	• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: alchemical supplies

Blood Hunter Multiclassing with Warlock:
If your blood hunter is part of the Order of Witch Knights and also has warlock levels, add one-third of your blood hunter levels (rounded down) to your warlock level and consult the warlock progression table in the Player's Handbook for total spell slots, cantrips known, and spell slot level.

You should consider aligning your Otherworldly Patron feature between both classes, but your DM might allow you to have two different patrons at their discretion.

      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

        <name>Hunter's Bane</name>
        <text>You have survived the Hunter's Bane, a dark alchemical ritual that suffuses your blood with sinister magic, granting you an enhanced knowledge and awareness of evil. At 1st level, you gain proficiency in either Arcana, Nature, or Religion.
	As a bonus action, you can use this dark insight to analyze a creature you can see within 30 feet, making an ability check using the corresponding skill below (DC equals 8 + its CR):

Hunter's Bane:
Skill | Creature Types
Arcana | Aberrations, Dragons, Monstrosities
Nature | Beasts, Elementals, Oozes, Plants
Religion | Celestials, Fey, Fiends, Undead

On a success, you learn one characteristic of your choice from the following list: its highest ability score, lowest ability score, damage vulnerabilities, damage immunities, damage resistances, condition immunities, or another weakness (like a troll's Regeneration being stopped by taking fire damage).
	If the characteristic you choose doesn't apply to the target then the DM can reveal another relevant characteristic to you.

        <name>Blood Rites</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, you learn to harness the sinister magicks within your bloodstream to invoke the ancient power of Blood Rites:

Blood Rites Known:
At 2nd level, you know two Blood Rites of your choice from the list at the end of this class. When you reach certain Blood Hunter levels you learn more Rites of your choice, as shown in the Rites Known column of the Blood Hunter class table.
	Once you invoke a Blood Rite you must finish a short or long rest before you can invoke that Blood Rite again. When you have no uses of a Blood Rite remaining, you can make a Vital Sacrifice (detailed below) to use that Rite again.
	Blood Rites can only be used against creatures with blood.However, when you make a Vital Sacrifice to empower a Rite, you can target any creature, regardless if it has blood or not.

Rite Die:
Some Blood Rites use your Rite Die, which starts as a d4. At certain Blood Hunter levels, this die grows, as shown in the Rite Die column of the Blood Hunter class table.

Vital Sacrifice:
Some Blood Rites allow you to sacrifice your own life to fuel deadly effects. When you make a Vital Sacrifice, you reduce both your maximum and current hit points by one roll of your Rite Die. This reduction cannot be lessened in any way.
	If you have temporary hit points, you can reduce these in place of reducing your current hit points. You always reduce your maximum hit points when you make a Vital Sacrifice.
	At the end of your next long rest, any reductions to your maximum hit points from Vital Sacrifices return to normal.

Saving Throws:
If a Blood Rite requires a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you use your Rite save DC, as shown below:

	Rite save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Occult Order: Order of Undying Thirst</name>
        <text>Legends speak of an ancient vampire who came to regret the many atrocities he had committed when driven by his thirst. He gathered to himself a group of vampire hunters, and once they had vowed to scour the curse of vampirism from the world, passed his curse on to them and instructed them in the power of ancient blood magic. Known as the Order of Undying Thirst, these Blood Hunters relentlessly carry out their founding vow to exterminate all vampires.

Optional Rule: True Vampirism:
True vampiric power comes at significant cost. If you'd like to play as a true vampire, you gain ALL abilities below when you join this Occult Order:

	• Deathless Nature. You don't need to breathe.

	• Spider Climb. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Upon reaching 7th level, you can move across vertical surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

	• Superior Darkvision. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, you can only see shades of gray.

	• Sunlight Sensitivity. You have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to see is in direct sunlight.

If you already have this trait from another source then you gain vulnerability to radiant damage.

	Also, your affinity for blood magic increases the size of your Rite Die to a d6. At certain Blood Hunter levels, your Rite Die increases again: at 5th level it becomes a d8, at 11th level a d10, and finally a d12 at 17th level.
	Finally, whenever you use Crimson Offering, you can choose for its bonus damage to be necrotic damage.

        <text>The bargain you have struck with your Patron has granted you the ability to cast spells, much like a Warlock does:

Cantrips. You learn two Cantrips of your choice from the Witch Knight spell list. Upon reaching 13th level in this class you learn one additional Witch Knight Cantrip of your choice.

Spell Slots. The Witch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of those spell slots. All of your spell slots from this feature are the same level. To cast one of your Witch Knight spells of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all of your expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Witch Knight spell list. The Spells Known column of the Witch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more Witch Knight spells of 1st level or higher. Spells you choose must be of a level no higher than the level in the table's Slot Level column for your level.
	Whenever you gain a Blood Hunter level, you can choose one Witch Knight spell you know and replace it with another Witch Knight spell of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Witch Knight spells. You use your Intelligence when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC, and when making a spell attack roll.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
