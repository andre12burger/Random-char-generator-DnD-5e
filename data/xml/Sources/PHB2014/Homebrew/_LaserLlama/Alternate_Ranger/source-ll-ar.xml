  <description>As the graying man made his way through the underbrush of the forest his faded green cloak made him nearly invisible. The monstrously large troll he had been stalking through the night had finally stopped to rest. As the great brute lay down to sleep, the silent green shape emerged from the trees to snuff out the life of the hideous monster.
	As the massive blue dragon descended upon the small town, a small half-elven man rolled out of the path of a blast of lightning. With the small hairs on the back of his neck still standing up from the residual electricity, the practiced hunter nocked an arrow and let it fly in the direction of the terrible beast. As the dart struck, the dragon let out a horrible roar and plummeted to the ground landing in a broken heap.
	As the fearsome owlbear lumbered toward the tiny hamlet that she called home, a small halfling whistled to her companion in the brush. At her signal, a giant dog that seemed to be more fur than anything else leaped out from hiding and stood defiantly in front of the owlbear. Distracted by her partner, the owlbear was caught completely unawares by the diminutive ranger. Once their foe was unconscious, the halfling and her dog released the owlbear miles away where it could live without menacing the town they protected.
	All three of the adventurers described here are considered Rangers, wild wanderers, and defenders of the natural world.</description>
