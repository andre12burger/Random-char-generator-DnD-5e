    <text>The handle of this elegant rapier is fashioned from silver and steel, and the hollow blade is filled with ink. It bears an Elvish inscription that, when translated, reads "The pen is mightier than the sword, but this is mightier still". You gain a +1 bonus to both attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon.
	This magic rapier has 4 Charges. When you hit a target with this weapon, you can expend 1 Charge to release a blast of ink. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. This effect ends early if the creature uses its action to wipe the ink from its eyes.
	This magic rapier regains 1d4 Charges daily, at dawn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Proficiency: martial, rapier

    <text>This fanciful quill looks to be made from the feather of a bird of mysterious origin. As an action, you can speak the Quill's command word and touch the Quill to a piece of paper or parchment. As long as the Quill can hear you, it transcribes your words exactly. The Quill transcribes for 1 hour, but it stops sooner if you speak its command word again.
