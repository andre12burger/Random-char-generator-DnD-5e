      <name>The Magus</name>
      <text>As the swordsman made his way through the busy marketplace, his eyes flashed green for a brief moment. He could see the unmistakable aura of arcane magic surrounding the humble dwarf shopping for wares. He had found his target. As the warrior drew his blade, what had appeared to be a mere dwarf peasant seconds before reverted to its true form. As the demon lunged forward, the swordsman met claw with his blade.
	The assassin watched as the Duke walked the streets with a single guard at his side. As the would-be assassin's blade darted toward the Duke's exposed neck, glee turned to fear as the armored guard appeared where the Duke had been moments before. Before the killer could react, a blade of emerald flame had pierced his chest.
	The halfling knelt before the three hooded figures that stood before her. She had spent nearly two years of her life searching for a member of this secret order, and now she had found three. Consumed by sorrow after her father's death at the hands of a wicked sorcerer, the young halfling swore she would do whatever it took to gain the power to exact her revenge. Now that the moment was at hand, she swore fealty to the secretive order, offering up her life in return for power.
	All three of the warriors described above are Magi, users of sword and spell, weaving both together in a deadly dance.

    <trait>
      <name>Sword and Spell</name>
      <text>Known by many names throughout the multiverse, those who are able to wield both sword and spell are collectively known as Magi. Rather than dedicate their lives to studying arcane magic or mastering martial techniques, Magi are dedicated to a middle path. Though they may never command the earth-shattering magic of an archmage, or go toe to toe with a true master of the blade, a Magus is able to master a unique form of arcane combat only used by the members of their Order.
	Their signature style of magic allows them to channel spells through their weapon strikes, sense the presence of arcane magic in the world around them, and even strike the weaves of spells from the air before they can take effect.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Secret Orders</name>
      <text>The magic of the Magi is not something everyone can learn. Over time, these arcane warriors have organized themselves into clandestine societies, content to operate in the shadows. Potential Magi are often identified from a young age and are inducted into an Order only after they have proven their skill and dedication. While some Orders are more secretive than others, nearly every Order of Magi is thought to be nothing more than legend to the vast majority common folk.
	As Magi rise through the ranks of their secret society, they are expected to infiltrate and form relationships with those in positions of power. They often set themselves up as personal advisors, guards, and consorts to influential nobles, powerful archmages, and wealthy merchants. Though Magi may form relationships, their primary loyalty is always to their Order.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Creating a Magus</name>
      <text>Those who pursue life as a Magus often give up everything in order to be accepted and trained by a master. What motivates your Magus? Have you always had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and skill? Was one of your loved ones slain by an evil mage, setting you on the path of revenge, no matter the personal cost? Or, do you simply desire to increase your skill with both sword and sorcery in tandem with one another?
	Also, decide where you acquired your training as a Magi. Are you an initiate in a secret society of arcane warriors? Or, were you trained in secret by a renegade member of an order of powerful magi who work to control the world? Maybe you were raised from birth so as to perfectly develop your talent in the art of war alongside your arcane potential.

Quick Build:
You can make a Magus quickly by using these suggestions. First, depending on the weapons you wish to use, make your Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by your Intelligence. Second, choose the Sage background.</text>

        <name>Multiclass Magus</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose the magus as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a magus.

	• Intelligence 13
	• Either Strength or Dexterity 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a magus.

	• Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: none

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

      <feature>
        <name>Arcane Armory</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you learn the signature enchantment of the Magi, marking you as a member of their ranks. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can touch one melee weapon, shield, or set of armor to perform a ritual adding the item to your Arcane Armory. Your Arcane Armory is an extradimensional space that only its Magus can access.
	Objects in your Arcane Armory gain the following benefits:

	• They count as magical weapons, shields, or sets of armor.

	• You can use your Intelligence, in place of Dexterity, when calculating Armor Class in this light and medium armor, so long as you do not already add it to your Armor Class.

	• As a bonus action, you can shunt or summon any number of objects of your choice from within your Arcane Armory, instantly equipping, donning, or doffing those items.

Your Arcane Armory can hold a total number of objects equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of 1) at one time, but one of those objects must always be a weapon. If you perform this ritual on another object while the Armory is at its maximum, one object of your choice is removed.

Arcane Armory &amp; Antimagic Effects:
The effects of the antimagic field spell, and other similar effects, suppress the effects of your Arcane Armory while you are within the area of antimagic.

        <text>At 1st level, you adopt a Fighting Style feat that best reflects your training (added as feats). You cannot select a Fighting Style feat more than once, even if a feature allows you to select another Fighting Style feat.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can switch your Fighting Style feat for another Fighting Style feat of your choice.

        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, you have learned to cast arcane spells, much like a Wizard, which you use to enhance your abilities in combat:

Cantrips:
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Magus spell list, which can be found at the end of this class description. You learn another Magus cantrip at 4th and 10th level, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Magus table.

Spellcasting Focus:
You can use any weapon or shield within your Arcane Armory as a spellcasting focus for your Magus spells. They can also be used to perform the somatic components of Magus spells.
	You can also use an Arcane Focus as a spellcasting focus.

Spell Slots:
The Magus table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast a spell you know, you must expend a spell slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots each time you finish a long rest.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Magus spell list. The Spells Known column of the Magus table shows when you learn more Magus spells. Each Magus spell you learn must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 6th level, you learn a spell of your choice from the Magus spell list of either 1st-level or 2nd-level.
	Whenever you gain a Magus level, you can choose one Magus spell you know and replace it with another Magus spell of your choice, of a level that you have spell slots for.

Spellcasting Ability:
As you commit your spells to memory, Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Magus spells. Use Intelligence when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when you set a saving throw DC, or when you make a spell attack roll.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

        <name>Spellstrike</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you learn to channel your spells through weapons. Once per turn when you would make an attack, you can cast a Magus spell, expending a spell slot as normal, and make an attack with a melee Arcane Armory weapon. To be channeled through a Spellstrike attack in this way, the spell must meet the following requirements:

	• The Magus spell must have a casting time of 1 action.

	• The Magus spell must require a single spell attack roll, force its target to make a saving throw, or affect a total number of hit points worth of creatures (like sleep).

If your attack misses, the spell fails and has no effect. On a hit, the spell takes effect immediately after the normal effects and damage of your weapon attack, using the rules below:

Area of Effect. If the spell targets an area greater than a 10-foot cube, it takes effect as a 15-foot cone originating from you, which must include your target, or it is contained to only affect the target of your attack (your choice on hit).

Cantrips. You do not deal the damage of the Cantrip along with the damage of your weapon. Instead, your weapon deals the damage type dealt by the Cantrip, and applies the Cantrip's additional effects, other than damage, on hit.

Concentration. If the spell requires your concentration, you must concentrate on it as soon as it takes effect on hit.

Saving Throws. If the spell requires a saving throw when cast, the target makes the initial saving throw at disadvantage on hit. If you score a critical hit on the attack, it automatically fails this saving throw. Other targets (if any) save as normal.

Spell Attacks. If the spell requires a spell attack roll, it instantly takes effect when you hit with your weapon attack.

	Your Companion can use its Elemental Breath a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and it regains all expended uses when it finishes a long rest.

While most Spellbreakers harbor a deep distrust for mages of all kinds, some are known work alongside other spellcasters to hunt down a dangerous foe.
	If you are playing a Spellbreaker Magus and have a spellcaster in your party, make sure to come to an arrangement that allows you to work as a team.
