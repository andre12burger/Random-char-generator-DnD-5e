      <name>The Vessel</name>
      <text>A ragged young man fled down an alley in a vain attempt to lose the thugs that pursued him. As their shadows grew longer, he realized that he had no choice. As the ruffians pinned him against the wall, he called upon the sinister entity bound to his soul. When he finally regained his senses, the smell of sulfur was overwhelming. He fled from the alley, leaving the charred remains of the brigands behind; the latest victims of the dark presence he harbored within.
	An austere elven woman stood on a dais at the center of a crowded temple. Members of church hierarchy and common folk alike had come to witness her holy transformation. She did not know why she was chosen, but within her soul was bound a fallen celestial, charged to perform one hundred and one good deeds in order to regain its status in the heavenly host. As the crowd gathered, she gave herself over to inner radiance.
	The strange elderly halfling knew that he did not belong in the tower he called home. The tower's keeper, a reclusive old archmage, only kept him around as a reminder of what would happen to any who dared to cross him. At night, the halfling could hear crying inside of his head, the sounds of a former pupil who had attempted to betray the great archmage, now bound to the aging body and soul of the lowliest student.
	All three people described above are Vessels, bearers of wondrous otherworldly power in the form of Spirits bound within their body and soul. With training, these adventurers can learn to wield a fraction of their Spirit's amazing power.

      <name>Otherworldly Power</name>
      <text>Within every Vessel is bound an extraplanar being of strange and wondrous power. No matter their origin, these immortal Spirits cannot be killed by conventional means. Instead, they are often bound to mortal flesh, forced to dwell within a body on the material plane. While many such Spirits are bound to their Vessel against their will, some choose to dwell within a mortal, lending them power in causes that align with theirs.
	No matter the reason, these otherworldly beings are the source of the power for the adventurers known as Vessels.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Mortal Vessel</name>
      <text>A rare occurrence in most worlds, mortal Vessels will likely never meet another of their kind unless they seek them out. The binding of an otherworldly Spirit is a deadly task, and is almost always done by a higher power or legendary mortal.
	Bearers of this extraplanar power can learn to channel the wondrous abilities of the Spirit inside them. Through their force of will, they can allow small amounts of this power out, channeling it to defend themselves, produce eldritch magic, enhance their physical abilities, and influence friend and foe.
	However, the mark of a true Vessel is their ability to take on the appearance of the Spirit bound to their soul, known as an Archon Form. Through this wondrous transformation, they are able to directly wield the power of the Spirit within, and use its power to overcome obstacles and thwart foes.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Creating Your Vessel</name>
      <text>When creating a Vessel, the most important thing to consider is how you came to be bound to the Spirit within you. Are you an Acolyte of a god, chosen to bear one of its angels that has fallen from grace? Are you a prophetic child of a cult, forced to bear the sinister power of their infernal lord? Or, are you descended from a bloodline of Vessels, each parent passing the Spirit on to their child when they have reached old age?
	Secondly, consider the nature of your Sealed Spirit and its relationship to you. Does your Spirit communicate with you freely, hoping that your goals will align? Is your Spirit bound against its will and seeking your demise so it can once again be free? Or, is the nature of your Sealed Spirit a mystery that you have struck out into the world to uncover more about?

Quick Build:
You can make a Vessel quickly by using these suggestions. First make Charisma your highest ability score, followed by your Constitution. Second, choose the Acolyte background. Finally, choose Opalescent Armor and Spirit Sense as your starting Unsealed Aspects.</text>

        <name>Starting Vessel</name>
        <text>As a 1st-level Vessel, you begin play with 10 + your Constitution modifier hit points.

You are proficient with the following items, in addition to any proficiencies provided by your race or background.

	• Armor: light armor
	• Weapons: simple weapons, scimitars, shortswords
	• Tools: none
	• Skills: Choose 2 from Acrobatics, Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, Religion, Survival

As a Vessel, you start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

	• (a) a scimitar or (b) two daggers
	• (a) a simple weapon or (b) a shortbow and 20 arrows
	• (a) an explorer's pack or (b) a priest's pack
	• leather armor and a quarterstaff

If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 4d4 × 10 gp to buy your equipment.

        <name>Multiclass Vessel</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose the vessel as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a vessel.

	• Constitution 13
	• Charisma 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a vessel.

	• Armor: light armor
	• Weapons: simple weapons
	• Tools: none

Spellcasting:
If you have a feature from another class that allows you to learn and cast spells, you can use your Vessel Magic spell slots to cast the spells you gained through that feature, and you can use those spell slots to cast your Vessel spells.

Source:	LaserLlama's The Vessel v3.0.1 p. 2 (Homebrew)</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

      <feature>
        <name>Spirit Mantle</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you can use a bonus action to cloak yourself with (or dismiss) your Spirit Mantle, an ethereal cloak of spiritual power that marks a dramatic change in your appearance.

While the Mantle is active, you gain the following features:

      <feature>
        <name>Iridescent Strike</name>
        <text>Whenever you make an unarmed strike you can cloak your attack in spiritual power. When you do so, you use Charisma, in place of Strength, for attack and damage rolls, its damage type changes to radiant, and its damage die becomes a d6.
	The damage die of this strike increases at certain Vessel levels: 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).
	Also, whenever you take the Attack action, you can make one unarmed Iridescent Strike as a bonus action.

        <text>You have learned to channel Aspects of your Spirit's power. At 1st level, you gain two Unsealed Aspects of your choice from the list at the end of this class. If an Aspect has a prerequisite, like another Unsealed Aspect or a Vessel level, you must meet those prerequisites to unlock it.
	At certain Vessel levels, you unlock additional Aspects, as shown in the Unsealed Aspects column of the Vessel table.
	Finally, when you unlock a new Unsealed Aspect, you can replace one of your Unsealed Aspects with another Aspect of your choice. Though, you can't replace prerequisite Aspects.

      <feature>
        <name>Vessel Magic</name>
        <text>Also at 2nd level, you learn to draw upon the immense power of the Sealed Spirit bound within your soul to produce spells:

Cantrips:
You learn two Cantrips of your choice from the Vessel spell list, which can be found at the end of this class description.
	You learn another Vessel Cantrip at 4th and 10th levels.

Spell Slots:
The Vessel table above shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Vessel spells and the level of those spell slots. All of your spell slots are the same level. To cast a Vessel spell of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all of your spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
At 2nd level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Vessel Spell List.
	The Spells Known column of the Vessel table shows when you learn additional Vessel spells of 1st-level and up. Vessel spells you learn must all be of a level equal to, or lower than, your Slot Level, as shown on the Vessel table.
	When you gain a Vessel level, you can replace one Vessel spell you know with a Vessel spell of your choice, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Vessel spells, as you are using your willpower to draw on the magic of the Spirit within. You use your Charisma when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting a saving throw DC for a spell, and when making a spell attack roll.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spellcasting Focus:
Your body is the spellcasting focus for your Vessel spells. You must have a free hand to cast a spell that requires a somatic or a material component, and you must still provide material components that are consumed by a spell or have a gold cost.

	Your Sealed Spirit grants you features at 3rd level, and again when you reach 6th, 14th, and 18th level in this class.

Archon Form:
Each Sealed Spirit includes a unique stat block for its Archon Form. Archons are vaguely ethereal, humanoid in shape, and share a resemblance to your Sealed Spirit's true nature.

Sealed Magic:
Each Sealed Spirit has a list of Spirit Spells that you learn at the Vessel levels noted in your Spirit's description. Your Spirit Spells count as Vessel spells for you, but do not count against your total number of Spells Known. You cannot replace these Spirit Spells with another spell when you gain a level.
	This also changes the effects of your Iridescent Strikes.

        <name>Archon Form</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to draw upon your Spirit's power to transform into its Archon Form, which uses the stat block in your Sealed Spirit's description.
	It may use your proficiency bonus (PB), Charisma modifier (CHA), and your Vessel Spell save DC in several places.
	You can maintain your Archon Form for 10 minutes. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend a Vessel Magic spell slot to extend the transformation by 10 minutes. You also revert to your normal form if you are incapacitated, or use a bonus action on your turn to do so.
	While in your Archon Form, the following rules apply:

	• Your game statistics are replaced those in your Archon's stat block. You retain your alignment, personality, ability scores, and your hit points. You also retain all your skill and saving throw proficiencies, and gain those of your Archon. If your Archon Form has the same skill proficiency as you, use the higher bonus between the two.

	• Your Archon Form gains the benefits of your Spirit Mantle. Some Archon Forms grant a bonus to your AC.

	• When you transform, you gain temporary hit points equal to your twice your Vessel level. Any temporary hit points you gain in Archon Form are lost when you revert.

	• You retain the benefits of any features from your class, player race, and any other source, and can use them if your Archon Form is capable of doing so, including casting spells with Vessel Magic.

	• When you transform, you choose if your equipment falls to the ground, merges into your Archon Form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but your DM can decide whether it is practical for your Archon to use it. Equipment that merges with your Archon has no effect until your transformation ends.

You can transform into your Archon Form once, and you regain the ability to transform again when you finish a short or long rest. If you have no uses left, you can expend a Vessel Magic spell slot to transform into your Archon Form again.

        <name>Illusory Strikes (The Trickster)</name>
        <text>Your Spirit projects potent illusions to attack your enemies. Whenever you would make an Iridescent Strike during your turn, you can forgo that attack to conjure one illusory copy of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. This illusory copy of you makes one Iridescent Strike against a target within range and disappears.

        <name>Fey Retribution (The Trickster)</name>
        <text>The power of the Trickster can reflect magic back on your foes. If you succeed on a saving throw against a spell, you can use your reaction to force the caster to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it suffers the effects of either charm person or charm monster.
	Once a creature is charmed by you in this way, it can't be charmed by this feature again until the next dawn.
