    <text>Offering a drop of blood, reduce your maximum hit points by 1 to conjure a Familiar. It is Friendly to you and it obeys your commands. Your familiar uses the following rules:

Statistics. Your Familiar manifests as a CR 0 Beast of your choice, but its creature type is Celestial, Fey, or Fiend. Familiars often reflect the true nature of the caster's soul in appearance and alignment. You can only have one Familiar, but you can perform the ritual again to change its form.

Control. In combat, the Familiar shares your initiative and acts during your turn. It cannot attack, but can otherwise act normally. If it drops to 0 hit points your Familiar is destroyed. If it is destroyed, you regain the maximum hit points spent in its creation at the end of your next long rest.

Dismissal. As an action, you can shunt your Familiar to a unique pocket dimension, or dismiss it forever. As an action, you can recall your Familiar from its pocket dimension, and it reappears in an unoccupied space you can see within 10 ft.

Soul Bound. While your Familiar is within 100 ft., you can communicate with it Telepathically. As an action, you can use your Familiar's senses in place of your own until you end this effect (no action required) or you are Incapacitated. While you do so, you are blind and deaf to your own surroundings.

Spellcasting. When you cast a spell with a range of touch and your Familiar is within 100 ft., your Familiar can use its reaction to deliver that spell using your Spellcasting ability.

	The first Small or larger creature to move into that space triggers your Snare and must make a Dexterity saving throw or fall Prone in its space and be Restrained by the Snare. If a creature is unaware of the Snare, it makes this saving throw with disadvantage. If a creature is in the space when you set the Snare, the Snare is instantly triggered.

At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a 2nd level spell slot, the Snare deals 2d6 slashing damage whenever a creature fails a saving throw to avoid or escape the Snare.

    <text>A beam of crackling energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and neither you nor the target can move more than 30 feet away from each other while this spell lasts.
	You can use an action on each subsequent turn to deal an additional 1d12 lighting damage to the creature. A creature can attempt to move beyond the range of the spell by using its action to make a Strength check against your Spell save DC. If another creature attempts to move the target of this spell beyond the range of this spell it can use its action to make a Strength check against your Spell save DC. Any attempts by the target or another creature (magical or mundane) to move the target beyond this range automatically fail.
	The spell immediately ends if you are forced to move more than 30 feet away from the target of this spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the initial and subsequent damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.

The Steed takes on the form of a Medium or Large quadrupedal beast that you have seen before with a CR of 1/2 or lower that does not have a climbing, flying, or swimming speed. Examples include: elk, camel, giant goat, mastiff, pony, or warhorse.
	Your Steed uses the stat block of the form chosen for it, but its creature type now reflects your alignment: celestial (good), fey (neutral), or fiend (evil). The Steed's Intelligence becomes 6 if it was lower, and it understands one language you speak.
	In combat, the Steed shares your initiative and acts during your turn. You control the Steed and choose how it acts, both in and out of combat. While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.
	While you and your Steed are within 1 mile of one another, you can use a special form of telepathy to communicate.
	If your Steed is reduced to 0 hit points it disappears. You can also use a bonus action to dismiss your Steed, causing it to disappear. Should you cast this spell again you can choose to either conjure the same Steed, and it reappears in range at its maximum hit points, or to conjure a new Steed, releasing your previous Steed from its bond in the process.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, your Steed can take on the form of any Medium or Large quadrupedal or winged beast, celestial, or monstrosity that you have seen before that has a CR of 2 or lower. Examples include: dire wolf, griffon, pegasus, peryton, polar bear, or rhinoceros.

If commanded to attack, it can only make one attack (even if it could make more in life), and it uses your Spellcasting ability for attack and damage rolls. It's creature type is Undead, and it has hit points equal to 7 times the level of the spell slot.

Control: In combat, your Thrall shares your initiative and acts during your turn. However, unless you give it a command, it remains in its space and will only act to defend itself.
	As a bonus action, you can Telepahtically command to any Thralls within 60 ft. You determine how they will act on their turn, or set a general course of action for them (ie: defend the door). Thralls follow commands until they are complete.

Undead Bond: While a Thrall is under your control, you can't regain the spell slot expended in its creation. However, When you finish a long rest, you can end your control over a Thrall to regain the slot. If you do so, that Thrall is freed and is hostile to all living things, the spellcaster in particular.

At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell with a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the CR of creature you can raise as your Undead Thrall increases by 1 for each slot level above 3rd.

The target can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
	If your target is a fiend or undead, or if it has the sunlight sensitivity trait, the bonus radiant damage increases by 1d8.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, the radiant damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2nd.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

    <text>This spell can only be cast at night. You spill your blood onto the corpse as part of a sinister ritual, reducing your maximum hit points by 1 and creating a Skeleton or Zombie under your control. Undead created by this spell use the rules below:

Control: As a bonus action, you can mentally command the Undead you created with this spell, so long as they are within 60 feet. You determine how they act or set a general course of action (defend the door). Undead follow commands until they are complete. If you order the Undead to attack, it can make a single attack (even if it could make more than one in life), and it uses your Spellcasting ability for attack and damage rolls.
	However, if you do not issue your Undead any commands, they remain in their space and act only defend themselves.

Undead Bond: While an Undead is under your control you can't regain the maximum hit points expended in its creation. However, when you finish a long rest, you can release control over your Undead to regain the maximum hit points spent to create it. When released, your Undead becomes hostile to all living things, the spellcaster that created it in particular.

At Higher Levels: You can cast this spell with a spell slot of a higher level, and expend additional maximum hit points (Max. HP) to create more powerful Undead, as shown here:

Create Undead:
Slot Level Max | HP | Undead
5th | 2 | Ghoul
6th | 4 | Ghast
7th | 6 | Mummy, Wight
8th | 8 | Flameskull
9th | 10 | Revenant, Vampire Spawn

	This spell has no effect on targets with 0 hit points. While transformed, creatures use the following rules:

Form: The new form can be any living Beast you have seen before. Creatures can only be transformed into a Beast with a CR equal to (or lower then) half its level or CR.

Statistics: The creature's game statistics, including mental ability scores are replaced by those of the Beast, but it retains its alignment, personality, and its Hit Points. If the creature is reduced to zero hit points, it reverts to its normal form.

Actions: The creature can only take the actions that would be available to that Beast. It cannot speak, cast spells, or take any actions that require hands or speech.

Equipment: Its clothing, weapons, armor, and objects it is holding meld into the new form. However, it can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

    <text>A shimmering opaque wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range and lasts for the duration.

Orientation &amp; Shape: The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or an angle. It can be free floating or rest on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome, a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. Nothing can pass through the wall physically, and anything viewed through it is lightly obscured. The wall extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall. If it cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creatures must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it chooses which side of the wall it moves to. On a failure, you choose the side it moves to.

Statistics: The wall has 150 hit points and its Armor Class equals your Spell save DC. It is immune to poison, psychic, and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, vulnerable to force and magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and resistant to all other damage types. It cannot be dispelled by a dispel magic spell, but a disintegrate spell destroys the wall it instantly.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th-level or higher, the hit points of the wall created by this spell increase by 25 for each spell slot level above 5th.

Shape: If you choose cage, it can be up to 20 feet on a side and made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart. If you choose box, it can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out of the area. The cage extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

Creatures Inside: When you cast the spell, any creatures that are completely inside the area of the cage are trapped. Any creatures partially within the area, or too large to fit are pushed away until they are completely outside of the cage.
	A creature inside the cage cannot leave it by non-magical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. The spell or effect is wasted on a failed save, but on a success the creature uses the spell or effect to escape.

Statistics: The cage's Armor Class equals your Spell save DC and it has 200 hit points. It is immune to poison, psychic, and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, vulnerable to force and magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and resistant to all other damage types.

If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. If this excess damage reduces its normal form to 0 hit points, it is knocked unconscious.

Actions: The actions the creature can take are limited to those its new form is able to perform. It cannot speak, cast spells, or take any actions that require hands or speech.

Equipment: Its clothing, weapons, armor, and objects it is holding meld into the new form. However, it can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can target up to 10 creatures within range.

    <text>You conjure a terrifying mass of storm clouds centered on a point you can see, spreading outward to a radius of 360 feet. You are completely immune to the effects of this dark storm. Violent winds, thunder, and lighting fill the storm, forcing all creatures within and below the storm to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 2d6 thunder damage and are Deafened while they remain in the area.
	Each subsequent round the storm lasts, you can use your action to add (or end) one of the weather effects below, which lasts for the duration. They affect all creatures and objects in and below the storm, and each can only be added once:

Acid Rain: Acidic rain falls from the clouds, dealing 1d6 acid damage to all creatures at the end of each of your turns.

Freezing Rain: Frigid rain falls from the clouds. The area becomes difficult terrain and heavily obscured. Targets in the area take 1d6 cold damage at the end of each of your turns.

Hail Stones: You infuse the storm with bitter cold. At the end of each of your turns, creatures and objects in the area take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and crops are destroyed.

High Winds: Strong winds up to 50 miles per hour rage, instantly dispersing all fog, mist, or similar effects, mundane or magical. Ranged attacks in the area become impossible.

Lightning Strikes: You charge the storm with lightning. As a bonus action on each turn, you can call six bolts of lighting from the cloud, each striking targets of your choice within the area. They must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 lighting damage on a failure, and half on a success.

    <text>Drawing on the deepest fears, regrets, and primal instincts of a creature, you create the illusion of the most horrifying thing imaginable to them, which is visible only to that creature.
	Choose a point within range, and creatures of your choice within a 30-foot radius of the point become frightened for the duration. If a target is immune to the frightened condition, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened anyway.
	At the end of each of a frightened creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it takes 4d10 psychic damage. On a success, the spell ends for that target.

Frightened:
	• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
	• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.
