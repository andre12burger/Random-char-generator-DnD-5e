        <name>Tactical Focus (Warlord (Livestream))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, your tactical acumen allows you to study an area of a battlefield and provide direction to your allies that can tilt a battle in your favor.

As a bonus action or as part of the attack action, you can select an area on the ground that measures 10 feet on each side. This area is your tactical focus. It remains your tactical focus until you use this ability again or you are unable to take actions.

When you select an area as your tactical focus, you choose one of your tactics to apply to that area. You gain three tactics at 3rd level. You gain an additional tactic at 7th and 15 level. Each time you complete a long rest, you can swap one of your tactics for a different one.

        <name>Tactician's Insight (Warlord (Livestream))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you can grant your allies useful tactical insights while they are in the area of your tactical focus.

You gain a number of uses of insight based on your fighter level.

As a bonus action or as a part of an attack action you grant insight to yourself or allies in your tactical focus. You grant this benefit to yourself and as many allies as you wish in your focus, but you cannot expend more uses than you currently have [or more than the maximum in the table below. A creature can receive more than one Tactician's Insight when you take this action.]
A creature that gains your insight can use it in two ways. It can regain hit points immediately upon receiving it. Roll 2d10 and the creature regains that many hit points. If the creature would gain hit points that place it above its maximum, it gains the difference as temporary hit points.

Alternatively, a creature can save the insight to use when it hits with an attack. It increases the attack's damage by 2d10.

You regain expended uses of Tactician's Insight when you complete a long rest.

[Changed during stream to "You and your allies can basically teleport into your focus. Movement on allies turn." Specifically, the movement is not made as a reaction—your allies can use their movement on their turn(s) to move towards the focus, and gain bonuses to speed or other effects (for example, ignoring difficult terrain, or movement does not provoke opportunity attacks) to aid and incentivize this. Additionally, this may replace "Cover That Flank" in future.]

Some of these abilities require you to roll fewer dice when using a martial exploit. You cannot use an ability that reduces the total dice you roll for the exploit to less than 1. Such an ability is beyond your skill.

        <name>Path of the Shadow Harlequin (Weapon Master (Livestream))</name>
        <text>The Shadow Harlequin path is a school of artful sword play and mesmerizing flourishes. Its practitioners attack a foe's mind and body, maneuvering their foes into tactical blunders with cunning feints and sudden, surprising moves.

Shadow Harlequins typically fight with light, agile weapons, such as rapiers and short swords, but their talents are useful to almost any warrior.

Weapon Master (Livestream): Come Forth to Dance
Your weapon moves in a lazy, hypnotic pattern, luring your foe to blunder ahead and walk into your trap.

As an action, expend a martial exploit and select a creature that can see you within 15 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it moves up to 15 feet closer to you. You then make a single melee attack against it using your martial exploit with one die fewer.

Weapon Master (Livestream): Cutting Dialogue
If this exchange of blows is a dramatic play, let your rejoinder be its final act.

As a reaction when a creature makes a melee attack against you, you can expend a martial exploit and make a melee weapon attack against that creature. You can select one of the dice rolled and add it to your AC against the target's attack.

Weapon Master (Livestream): Dramatic Exit
Your overly dramatic strike distracts your opponent, allowing you to slip away from their grasp.

When you expend a martial exploit when making a melee weapon attack, you can move up to 5 feet, without provoking opportunity attacks, per exploit die rolled after your attack.

        <text>The Stone Dragon path focuses on brutal power and overwhelming toughness. Most of these exploits require you to attack with a two-handed melee weapon or a versatile melee weapon you wield in two hands.

Warriors of the Stone Dragon are often cruel destroyers. They fight with the subtlety and irresistible force of an avalanche. Their punishing attacks render their enemies immobile, allowing them to then take careful aim for one, final executioner's blow.

Weapon Master (Livestream): Adamantine Bones
You focus your mind and grit your teeth, pushing aside pain and drawing on wellsprings of energy that blot out the pain of your wounds.

When you expend a martial exploit when attacking with a two-handed melee weapon or a versatile one wielded in two hands, after rolling the dice you can select one or more of them. You gain temporary hit points equal to the total of the dice + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).

You can also activate this ability as a bonus action. In that case, you roll your martial exploit dice and gain temporary hit points equal to their total + your Constitution modifier.

Weapon Master (Livestream): Colossus Strike
You swing your weapon in an upward arc, catching your foe in the chest and sending them flying across the battlefield.

When you expend a martial exploit when attacking with a two-handed melee weapon or a versatile one wielded in two hands, after rolling the dice you can select one or more of them and disregard their result. For each die selected, you push the target 5 feet in a straight line along the ground if your attack hits.

Weapon Master (Livestream): Jaws of the Stone Dragon
Like a mighty dragon pouncing upon a helpless victim, you take stock of an immobilized foe before landing a crushing strike.

When you expend a martial exploit when attacking a target that cannot move or with a speed of 0 with a two-handed melee weapon or a versatile one wielded in two hands, you gain an additional +2 bonus per die used as a bonus to your weapon damage roll.

Weapon Master (Livestream): Mountain's Grasp
Your blows land with such force that your enemy is left off balance, unable to escape your brutal assault.

When you expend a martial exploit when attacking with a two-handed melee weapon or a versatile one wielded in two hands, after rolling the dice you can select at least two of them and disregard their results. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of your next turn.

Weapon Master (Livestream): Sweeping Bludgeon
As you ready to strike your enemy, you sweep your weapon around you in a great arc that builds momentum and forces your enemies to dive to the ground to avoid a crushing blow.

When you expend a martial exploit when attacking with a two-handed melee weapon or a versatile one wielded in two hands, after rolling the dice you can select one or more of them and disregard their result. For each die selected, pick a creature within reach of your attack. Each chosen creature must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

Warlord (Livestream): Gambits
The gambits are presented in alphabetical order.

Warlord (Livestream): Aggressive Advance
You and your allies howl in rage and glower at your foes, making a display that sends fear into their hearts.

Hostile creatures within 60 feet of you that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is frightened of your tactical focus. A creature frightened by this effect can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a successful save. As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action. [In future, may be changed to require you or an ally to be present within the focus.]

Warlord (Livestream): Cut Them Down!
You direct your allies to strike with perfect timing. Landing blows just as your enemies are of balance to send them tumbling to the ground.

Until the end of your next turn, hostile creatures in your tactical focus that you can see must make Strength saves each time they are hit by an attack. On a failed save, they are knocked prone. As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action.

Warlord (Livestream): Luring Gambit
You entangle your weapon with a chosen foe, luring it to duel you as your allies close in for the kill.

As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action. If you hit a creature with a weapon attack during your turn, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, your allies are invisible to it until the end of your next turn.

Warlord (Livestream): Pile On
You direct your allies' attacks against a target, each blow building on the next to build a devastating result. Select a creature in your tactical focus that you can see. At the start of your next turn, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw if you or an ally has hit it with an attack since you used this ability. It suffers disadvantage on the saving throw if it has been hit by three or more attacks [in future, this may be changed to "hit by three or more creatures"]. On a failed saving throw, the creature is stunned until the end of your next turn.

As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action.

Warlord (Livestream): Pincer Movement
With precise timing, you order your allies to charge into the enemy, dealing body checks that leave your foes entangled and helpless.

Up to two allies that can see or hear you can use their reactions to move up to their speed. Any creature adjacent to both of your allies or to you and one of the chosen allies at the end of their movement must make a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the end of your next turn. As part of this gambit, you may take the attack action.

Warlord (Livestream): Vexing Maneuvers
With precise movements, you and your allies dash around the foes to leave them confused and unable to pick out their most dangerous targets.

Each enemy in your tactical focus that you can see must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it cannot leave your tactical focus using its move until the end of your next turn. As part of this gambit you may take the attack action.
