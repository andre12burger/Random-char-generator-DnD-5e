Beauty can both bend minds and inspire hearts. It is the force that compels others to lose control and give in to their impulses, but it can also awaken strength and determination to steel a forlorn heart.

Clerics of Beauty bring joy and hope to the world. They are the beacon of light that reminds us that some things are worth fighting for. They seek to bring peace and amity among the world's folk. They fight only when they must, and prefer to use their magic to end fights with as little bloodshed as possible.

Domain Spells:
At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

Beauty Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1st | charm person, heroism
3rd | enthrall, suggestion
5th | beacon of hope, hypnotic pattern
7th | charm monster, compulsion
9th | dominate person, hold monster
