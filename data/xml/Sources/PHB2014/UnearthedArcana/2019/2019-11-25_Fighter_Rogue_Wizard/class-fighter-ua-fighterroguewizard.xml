        <text>Awakening to the psionic power within themselves, a Psychic Warrior is a fighter who augments their physical might with psychically infused weapon strikes, telekinetic lashes, and barriers of mental force.
	As a Psychic Warrior, you might have honed your psionic abilities through your own disciplined practice, unlocked it under the tutelage of a master, or developed it at an academy dedicated to wielding the mind's power as both weapon and shield.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Psionic Armament (Psychic Warrior (UA))</name>
        <text>You can channel your psychic power to magically augment your prowess. When you finish a long rest, choose whether to augment your defenses or your strikes. The chosen benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.

Augmented Defenses. When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d10 and reduce the amount of damage taken by the number rolled. When you reach 10th level in this class, the die changes to a d12.

Augmented Strikes. Once during each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can also deal 1d4 psychic damage to that target. When you reach 10th level in this class, the psychic damage increases to 1d6.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Strength of Mind (Psychic Warrior (UA))</name>
        <text>As a bonus action, you can telekinetically lash out at a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must make a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target takes force damage equal to 2d6 plus your Intelligence modifier and is telekinetically moved 15 feet directly toward or away from you (your choice). On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't moved.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

        <text>When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your attacks to project a bastion of psionic power in a 10-foot radius around yourself. It lasts for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. For the duration, you and your allies in that area gain the benefits of half cover and have advantage on Strength saving throws.
	Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until after you use your Second Wind feature.

        <name>Agonizing Strikes (Psychic Warrior (UA))</name>
        <text>Your attacks can channel psychic agony. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can also deal 2d10 psychic damage to that target and force it to make a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Unless the save succeeds, the target falls prone, and it suffers disadvantage on ability checks until the end of your next turn.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
