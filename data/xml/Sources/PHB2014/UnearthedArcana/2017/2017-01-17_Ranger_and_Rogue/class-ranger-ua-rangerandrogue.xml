        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Horizon Walker Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, and it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

5th | alter self
9th | protection from energy

        <name>Planar Warrior (Horizon Walker (UA))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you learn to draw on the energy of the planes to augment your attacks.
	As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Until the end of this turn, your attacks against that creature ignore its damage resistances, and the next time you hit it on this turn, it takes an additional 1d6 force damage.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Portal Lore (Horizon Walker (UA))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to detect the presence of planar portals. As an action, you detect the distance and direction to any planar portals within 1,000 feet of you. You also sense which plane of existence each portal leads to. However, if magic obscures any details of a portal, this feature doesn't reveal them.
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Alternatively, you can use the feature again if you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher.
	See the "Planar Travel" section in chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for examples of planar portals.

        <text>At 7th level, you learn to step through the Ethereal Plane. As a bonus action on your turn, you can cast the etherealness spell with this feature, but the spell ends at the end of the current turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

	If you attack at least two different creatures with the action, you can make one additional attack with it against a third creature.

        <text>At 15th level, your ability to move between planes becomes even more finely tuned. As a reaction when you take damage, you can halve that damage against you. For a moment, you slip into the planar boundary to lessen the harm.

        <text>Rangers of the Primeval Guardian Conclave follow an ancient tradition rooted in powerful druidic magic. These rangers learn to become one with nature, allowing them to channel the aspects of various beasts and plants in order to overcome their foes.
	These rangers dwell in the elder forests of the world. They venture out only rarely, as they consider it their sacred duty to protect the druidic groves and ancient trees that saw the earliest days of the world.

	You undergo the following changes while in your guardian form:

	• Your size becomes Large, unless you were larger.

	• Any speed you have becomes 5 feet, unless the speed was lower.
