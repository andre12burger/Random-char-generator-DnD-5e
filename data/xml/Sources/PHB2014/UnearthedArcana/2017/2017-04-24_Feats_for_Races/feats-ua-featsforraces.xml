    <text>You master the tinker techniques of your people. You gain the following benefits:

	• Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

	• When you make a check using your proficiency with tinker's tools, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check.

	• When you make a device with your Tinker trait, you have the following additional options for what you make:

This device senses when a creature moves to within 15 feet of it without speaking aloud a password chosen when you create it. One round after a creature moves into range, the alarm makes a shrill ringing that lasts for 1 minute and can be heard from up to 300 feet away.

This device makes doing sums easy.

This device can be used as a block and tackle, allowing its user to hoist five times the weight the user can normally lift.

This pocket watch keeps accurate time.

When used as an action, this device predicts weather conditions in a 1-mile radius over the next 4 hours, showing one symbol (clouds, sun/moon, rain, or snow) for each hour.
