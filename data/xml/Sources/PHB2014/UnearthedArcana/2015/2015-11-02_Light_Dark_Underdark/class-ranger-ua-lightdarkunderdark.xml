        <name>Ranger Archetype: Deep Stalker (UA)</name>
        <text>Adventurers descending into the depths on desperate quests or in response to the promise of vast riches quickly come face to face with the evil that festers beneath the earth. Though many such characters are only too happy to escape back to the surface world again, rangers with the Deep Stalker archetype welcome each foray into the world below, striving to uncover and defeat the threats of the Underdark before those threats can reach the surface.
	Many Deep Stalkers are elves, as those folk know all too well the threat posed by the drow. Deep Stalkers scout for new passages into the Underdark, carefully mapping them and working to ensure they remain watched at all times. They venture into the depths on long, dangerous patrols, disappearing for months at a time. Many of them never return.
	Deep Stalkers master spells useful in navigating the Underdark, and their combat tactics focus on ambush, surprise, and stealth. They fight alone or in small groups in hostile territory, relying on clever tactics to carry the day.

        <name>Underdark Scout (Deep Stalker (UA))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. On your first turn during combat, you gain a +10 bonus to your speed. If you use the attack action on that turn, you can make one additional attack.
	You gain an additional benefit on all turns after your first turn. At the end of each such turn, you can attempt to hide as a bonus action if you meet the normal requirements for hiding. Deep Stalkers often use this ability to make ranged attacks, move beyond the scope of their foes' darkvision, and then hide.
