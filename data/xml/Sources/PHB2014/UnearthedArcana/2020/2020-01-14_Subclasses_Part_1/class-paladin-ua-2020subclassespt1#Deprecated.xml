        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Watchers (UA)</name>
        <text>Paladins who vow the Oath of the Watchers seek to protect the mortal realm from the predations of extraplanar creatures, many of which can lay waste to mortal soldiers. Thus, the Watchers hone their minds, spirits, and bodies to be the ultimate weapons against such threats.
	Paladins who follow the Watchers' oath are ever vigilant in spotting the influence of extraplanar forces, often establishing a network of spies and informants to gather information on suspected cults. To a Watcher, keeping a healthy suspicion and awareness about one's surroundings is as natural as wearing armor in battle.

Tenets of the Watchers:
A paladin who assumes the Oath of the Watchers swears to safeguard the mortal realm from otherworldly threats.

Vigilance. The threats you face are cunning, powerful, and subversive. Be ever alert for their corruption.

Loyalty. Never accept gifts or favors from fiends or those who truck with them. Stay true to your order, your comrades, and your duty.

Discipline. You are the shield against the endless terrors that lie beyond the stars. Your blade must be forever sharp and your mind keen to survive what lies beyond.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Watchers table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

Oath of the Watchers Spells:
Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | alarm, chromatic orb
5th | augury, moonbeam
9th | counterspell, nondetection
13th | aura of purity, banishment
17th | hold monster, hallow

        <name>Channel Divinity (Oath of the Watchers (UA))</name>
        <text>You gain the following Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.

Watcher's Will. You can use your Channel Divinity to invest your presence with the warding power of your faith. As an action, you can choose a number of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). For 1 minute, all the chosen creatures have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

Abjure the Extraplanar. You can use your Channel Divinity to castigate unworldly beings. As an action, you present your holy symbol and each elemental, fey, fiend, or aberration within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
	A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

        <name>Aura of the Sentinel (Oath of the Watchers (UA))</name>
        <text>You emit an aura of alertness while you aren't incapacitated. When you and any creature of your choice within 10 feet of you rolls initiative, you each gain a bonus to initiative equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

        <name>Vigilant Rebuke (Oath of the Watchers (UA))</name>
        <text>You've learned how to magically chastise anyone who dares cast unwanted spells at you and your wards. Whenever you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you succeeds on a saving throw against a spell, you can use your reaction to deal 2d8 + your Charisma modifier force damage to the spellcaster.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Mortal Bulwark (Oath of the Watchers (UA))</name>
        <text>You manifest a spark of your deity's power in defense of your sacred oath. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

	• You gain truesight in a 120-foot radius.

	• You have advantage on attack rolls against elementals, fey, fiends, and aberrations.

	• When you hit a creature with an attack and deal damage to it, you can also force it to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is magically banished to its native plane of existence if it's currently not there. On a successful save, the creature can't be banished by this feature for 24 hours.

Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
