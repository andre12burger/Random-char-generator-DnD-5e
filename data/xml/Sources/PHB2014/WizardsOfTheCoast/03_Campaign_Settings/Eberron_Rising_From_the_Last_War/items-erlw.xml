    <text>This prosthetic appendage was developed by artificers of House Cannith. To attune to this item, you must attach it to your arm at the wrist, elbow, or shoulder, at which point the prosthetic magically forms a copy of the appendage it's replacing.
	While attached, the prosthetic provides these benefits:

	• The prosthetic is a fully capable part of your body.

	• You can take an action to remove the prosthetic, and it removes itself if your attunement to it ends. It can't be removed against your will.

	• The prosthetic is a magic melee weapon with which you're proficient. It deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the prosthetic detaches and flies at the target of the attack, then immediately returns to you and reattaches.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>This symbiotic crown is carved from dark purple and mauve stone, with ten points like stalks set with gemstones resembling the eyestalks of a beholder. To attune to this item, you must wear it on your head for the entire attunement period, during which the crown's hidden tendrils burrow into your scalp to bond with your skull.
	While wearing the crown, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.

Spells: The crown has 10 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (spell save DC 16): charm person (1 charge), disintegrate (6 charges), fear (3 charges), finger of death (7 charges), flesh to stone (6 charges), hold person (2 charges), ray of enfeeblement (2 charges), sleep (1 charge), slow (3 charges), telekinesis (5 charges).
	The crown regains 1d6 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Symbiotic Nature: The crown can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the crown ends, and it detaches from you.
	The daelkyr Belashyrra made these crowns. While on the same plane of existence as the crown, Belashyrra can see through its eyestalks.

    <text>A dimensional seal is a massive stone slab covered with a complex pattern of runes and sigils. The seal projects an invisible field with a radius of two miles. This field blocks all forms of conjuration magic and any other effect that involves teleportation or planar travel. It also negates the effects of any manifest zone within the field.
	Dimensional seals are usually found in the Eldeen Reaches and the Shadow Marches, as relics of the conflict between the Gatekeeper druids and the daelkyr. The techniques used to create these seals have been long lost. It's said that as a whole, the dimensional seals keep the daelkyr bound in Khyber and prevent Xoriat from becoming coterminous with Eberron. If enough of these seals are destroyed, there could be serious consequences for the world.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>A docent is a small metal sphere, about 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. To attune to a docent, you must embed the item somewhere on your body, such as your chest or your eye socket.

Sentience: A docent is a sentient item of any alignment with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It perceives the world through your senses. It communicates telepathically with you and can speak, read, and understand any language it knows (see "Random Properties" below).

Life Support: Whenever you end your turn with 0 hit points, the docent can make a Wisdom (Medicine) check with a +6 bonus. If this check succeeds, the docent stabilizes you.

Random Properties: A docent has the following properties:

	• Languages: The docent knows Common, Giant, and 1d4 additional languages chosen by the DM. If a docent knows fewer than six languages, it can learn a new language after it hears or reads the language through your senses.

	• Skills: The docent has a +7 bonus to one of the following skills (roll a d4): (1) Arcana, (2) History, (3) Investigation, or (4) Nature.

	• Spells: The docent knows one of the following spells and can cast it at will, requiring no components (roll a d6): (1-2) detect evil and good or (3-6) detect magic. The docent decides when to cast the spell.

Personality: A docent is designed to advise and assist the warforged it's attached to. One of the simple functions of a docent is to serve as a translator. The docent's properties are under its control, and if you have a bad relationship with your docent, it might refuse to assist you.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>A docent is a small metal sphere, approximately 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. Despite a strong magical aura, it has no obvious abilities. If you're a warforged, you can attune to the docent, at which point the sphere becomes embedded in your chest and comes to life—literally.
	A docent is an intelligent magic item designed to advise and assist the warforged it's attached to. A typical docent has an Intelligence score of 16 and Wisdom and Charisma scores of 14. Once you're attuned to the docent, it can communicate with you telepathically and can perceive the world through your senses. One of the simple functions of a docent is to serve as a translator. All docents understand Common and Giant, but a docent knows up to four additional languages. Elven and Draconic are common options. If a docent knows less than six languages in total, it can add new languages to its repertoire after encountering them. So a docent found in Xen'drik may have never encountered a dwarf before… but after spending some time in Khorvaire studying dwarves, it could pick up the Dwarven language.
	In addition, a docent possesses up to three of the following traits.

	• Can cast detect magic at will
	• Can cast detect evil and good at will
	• Can detect any form of divination or scrying targeting the warforged host.
	• Intelligence (Arcana) +7
	• Intelligence (History) +7
	• Intelligence (Investigation) +7
	• Intelligence (Nature) +7
	• Wisdom (Insight) +6
	• Wisdom (Perception) +6

The docent can make Wisdom (Medicine) checks targeting its warforged host, with a +7 bonus. If the host is rendered unconscious, the docent will automatically attempt to stabilize them once each turn.
	You can use a bonus action on your turn to request that the docent use one of its traits on your behalf. In the case of skills, this uses the docent's bonus; your abilities and proficiencies have no effect on the outcome. These traits are under the control of the docent, and if you have a bad relationship with your docent it may refuse to assist you… or simply lie about information that it obtains. However, if you treat your docent well it could serve as a useful ally.
	The origin of docents is a great mystery. House Cannith created the first warforged thirty years ago. But the docents come from the distant land of Xen'drik and appear to be thousands of years old. Were they created to interface with some other form of construct? Or are the modern warforged a new interpretation of an ancient design? The docents claim to have forgotten their creators… but this is a mystery waiting to be unraveled. While all docents come from Xen'drik, some have been brought to Khorvaire by explorers and it's possible to encounter them in the Five Nations.

    <text>Introduced into Sharn by Daask, dragon's blood is a potent and highly addictive stimulant. In addition to inducing euphoria, it can enhance spellcasting ability or even temporarily imbue a user with the ability to cast sorcerer spells. The drug's effects are potentially dangerous and always unpredictable. This isn't something a player character should want to use; adventurers are more likely to interfere with Daask smugglers or deal with an addict who accidentally casts a fireball in a crowded street. The specific effects of dragon's blood are up to you, but you can take inspiration from the PHB.

    <text>A psychoactive liquid that smells and tastes like your favorite beverage, essence of dreamlily is a Sarlonan opiate. First imported to help manage pain during the Last War, it's now the most commonly abused substance in Sharn. Though dreamlily isn't illegal if used for medicinal purposes, it's heavily taxed, and thus most dreamlily is smuggled in and sold on the black market. Dreamlily dens can be found across the lower wards. Consuming dreamlily causes disorienting euphoria and brings about remarkable resistance to pain. A creature under the effects of dreamlily is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it drops to 0 hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead. A dose of dreamlily costs around 1 gp, or up to ten times that if purchased through legal channels. There are many varieties of the drug, however, and the duration or the price might vary accordingly.

    <text>This long, whip-like strand of tough muscle bears a sharp stinger at one end. To attune to this symbiotic weapon, you wrap the whip around your wrist for the entire attunement period, during which time the whip painfully embeds its tendrils into your arm.
	You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic whip, but attack rolls made against aberrations with this weapon have disadvantage. A creature hit by this weapon takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage. When you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll with this weapon, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn.
	As a bonus action, you can sheathe the whip by causing it to retract into your arm, or draw the whip out of your arm again.

Symbiotic Nature: The whip can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the whip ends, and it detaches from you.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Spells: The earworm has 4 charges. You can cast the following spells from it, expending the necessary number of charges (spell save DC 15): detect thoughts (2 charges) or dissonant whispers (1 charge). Each time you use the earworm to cast the detect thoughts spell, it sends the information gleaned to the nearest daelkyr, or to the next nearest earworm until it reaches a daelkyr.
	The earworm regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

Symbiotic Nature: The earworm can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the earworm ends, and it exits your body.

    <text>Eberron dragonshards are found in shallow soil, and often encased in geode-like stone shells. Eberron shards can be found almost anywhere, but the most significant deposits have been discovered in jungle environments, notably Q'barra and the distant land of Xen'drik. In their raw form, Eberron shards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls flowing their depths.
	Eberron shards are the most common form of dragonshard. They are primarily refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise. Dragonshard dust is used in the creation of magic items, and many powerful tools | such as the lightning rail and elemental airships | require an ongoing expenditure of Eberron dragonshards to maintain their enchantments.

Resistant: While attuned to Kyrzin's ooze, you have resistance to poison and acid damage, and you're immune to the poisoned condition.

Amorphous: As an action, you can speak a command word and cause your body to assume the amorphous qualities of an ooze. For the next minute, you (along with any equipment you're wearing or carrying) can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Acid Breath: As an action, you can exhale acid in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Symbiotic Nature: The ooze can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the ooze ends, as it seeps out of you.

A shard can be created blank or already filled with information. When the shard is created, the creator can set a passphrase that must be spoken to access the information stored within.
	While holding the shard, you can use an action to open your mind to the shard, seeing its content in your mind. On subsequent rounds, reading the text or scribing new text on blank "pages" in the shard requires concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) and takes the same amount of time it takes you to read and write normally. Thinking of a particular phrase or topic draws you to the first section in the shard that addresses it.

	When you make a Charisma (Performance) or Charisma (Persuasion) check while wearing the glamerweave, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <name>Ventilating Lungs</name>

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>These metallic nodules were created in response to the poisonous gases used on the battlefields of the Last War. When you attune to these lungs, they replace the lungs in your chest, which disappear. The lungs allow you to breathe normally, even in an antimagic field, and their breathing function can't be suppressed by magic.
	Outside an antimagic field or any other effect that suppresses magic, these lungs allow you to breathe normally in any environment (including a vacuum), and you have advantage on saving throws against harmful gases such as those created by a cloudkill spell, a stinking cloud spell, inhaled poisons, and gaseous breath weapons.
	As an action, you can use these lungs to exhale a gust of wind, as if you had cast the gust of wind spell (spell save DC 15) with no components. This property of the lungs can't be used again until the next dawn.
	If your attunement to the lungs ends, your original lungs reappear.

    <name>Wand Sheath</name>
    <detail>common (requires attunement by a warforged)</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>A wand sheath clamps onto your arm and imparts the following benefits:

	• The wand sheath can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it.

	• You can insert a wand into the sheath as an action. The sheath can hold only one wand at a time.

	• You can retract or extend a wand from the sheath as a bonus action. While the wand is extended, you can use it as if you were holding it, but your hand remains free.

If a sheathed wand requires attunement, you must attune to the wand before you can use it. However, the wand sheath and the attached wand count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. If you remove the wand from the sheath, your attunement to the wand ends.

    <text>When mounted at the helm of an elemental galleon or airship, this wheel allows a creature that possesses the Mark of Storm to telepathically control the elemental bound inside the vessel.
	If a wheel of wind and water is mounted on a mundane sailing ship, a creature with the Mark of Storm who is using the wheel can create an area of ideal conditions around the vessel, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour.
