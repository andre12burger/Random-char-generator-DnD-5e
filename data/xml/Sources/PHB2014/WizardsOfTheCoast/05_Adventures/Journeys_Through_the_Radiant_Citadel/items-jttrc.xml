    <text>The Hammock of Worlds is a colorful hammock woven with traditional Ataguan designs. It can be used only by a member of the order known as the Green Doctors.
	You can use an action to unfold and place the Hammock of Worlds on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to the Ghost Orchid Tepui in the Feywild or to the Drought Elder in the Far Realm (the user's choice). You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once Hammock of Worlds has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours.

    <text>The Hammock of Worlds is a colorful hammock woven with traditional Ataguan designs.
	You can use an action to unfold and place the lesser version of the Hammock of Worlds on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the DM decides where it leads or the user can cause it to always reliably connect to the Ghost Orchid Tepui. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once the lesser version of the Hammock of Worlds has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours.

    <text>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no other creature within its reach, the poisoned creature does nothing on its turn. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Inhaled: These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

    <text>Every few years, a ghost orchid colony grows a black pod as thick as a human fist that holds three soft, black seeds. A creature that consumes one of these black seeds is affected by the spell feign death. If the creature is unaware of the pod's effects or does not wish to be affected, it can resist the effect by succeeding on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Otherwise, it is considered to be a willing recipient of the spell.

	More rarely, the orchids produce a smaller pod holding a single white seed. Among its various magical properties, if a white seed is ground and scattered over a dead body, the body is affected by the resurrection spell. A white ghost orchid seed has no effect if consumed.
