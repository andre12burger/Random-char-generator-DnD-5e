    <text>On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.

You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, when you're damaged by a creature in reach, you may use your reaction to make one melee attack against it with this weapon.

Curse: You're unwilling to part with this weapon while attuned to it. While attuned, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one.
	Whenever a hostile creature damages you, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action on each of your turns to attack the creature nearest to you with the weapon. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You're berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. Alternatively, an ally can use an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check and if successful, you're no longer berserk. Only the Remove Curse spell allows you to end attunement to this item.

Corrupting: This item corrupts. See the "Infernal Item Corruption" section.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When this weapon reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature doesn't die. Instead, infernal runes appear as if carved into their flesh and they're healed to 1 hit point. They now have the paralyzed condition until the condition is removed by a Lesser Restoration spell or similar magic. When the condition is removed, the runes disappear. At the start of each of their turns while they're paralyzed, the creature suffers immense pain and gains a level of exhaustion.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
