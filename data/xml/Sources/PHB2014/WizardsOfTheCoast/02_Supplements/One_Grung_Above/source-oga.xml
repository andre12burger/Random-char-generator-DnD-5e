  <description>From the depths of the jungles of Chult they're here!

Summaries of the characters from the new Twitch streamed game in all their glory, plus the officially UNOFFICIAL grung traits used to created them.

Disclaimer: Outside of a certain surrogate character, this document in no way makes grung a legal, playable race in the D&amp;D Adventurers League, or any other campaign where the Dungeon Master hates amphibians with an excess of apostrophes in their names… and yes if you're not immune to poison and you must touch the grung to heal it... you get to make a saving throw.</description>
