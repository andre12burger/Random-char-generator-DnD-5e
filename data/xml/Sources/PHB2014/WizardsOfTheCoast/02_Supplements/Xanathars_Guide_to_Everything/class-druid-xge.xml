      <text>"Even in death, each creature plays its part in maintaining the Great Balance. But now an imbalance grows, a force that seeks to hold sway over nature. This is the destructive behavior of the mortal races. The farther away from nature their actions take them, the more corrupting their influence becomes. As druids, we seek mainly to protect and educate, to preserve the Great Balance, but there are times when we must rise up against danger and eradicate it."
— Safhran, archdruid

Druids are the caretakers of the natural world, and it is said that in time a druid becomes the voice of nature, speaking the truth that is too subtle for the general populace to hear. Many who become druids find that they naturally gravitate toward nature; its forces, cycles, and movements fill their minds and spirits with wonder and insight. Many sages and wise folk have studied nature, writing volumes about its mystery and power, but druids are a special kind of being: at some point, they begin to embody these natural forces, producing magical phenomena that link them to the spirit of nature and the flow of life. Because of their strange and mysterious power, druids are often revered, shunned, or considered dangerous by the people around them.
	Your druid character might be a true worshiper of nature, one who has always scorned civilization and found solace in the wild. Or your character could be a child of the city who now strives to bring the civilized world into harmony with the wilderness. You can use the sections that follow to flesh out your druid, regardless of how your character came to the profession.

      <name>Treasured Item</name>
      <text>Some druids carry one or more items that are sacred to them or have deep personal significance. Such items are not necessarily magical, but every one is an object whose meaning connects the druid's mind and heart to a profound concept or spiritual outlook.
	When you decide what your character's treasured item is, think about giving it an origin story: how did you come by the item, and why is it important to you?

Treasured Item:
d6 | Treasured Item
1 | A twig from the meeting tree that stands in the center of your village
2 | A vial of water from the source of a sacred river
3 | Special herbs tied together in a bundle
4 | A small bronze bowl engraved with animal images
5 | A rattle made from a dried gourd and holly berries
6 | A miniature golden sickle handed down to you by your mentor</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Guiding Aspects</name>
      <text>Many druids feel a strong link to a specific aspect of the natural world, such as a body of water, an animal, a type of tree, or some other sort of plant. You identify with your chosen aspect; by its behavior or its very nature, it sets an example that you seek to emulate.

Guiding Aspects:
d6 | Guiding Aspects
1 | Yew trees remind you of renewing your mind and spirit, letting the old die and the new spring forth.
2 | Oak trees represent strength and vitality. Meditating under an oak fills your body and mind with resolve and fortitude.
3 | The river's endless flow reminds you of the great span of the world. You seek to act with the long-term interests of nature in mind.
4 | The sea is a constant, churning cauldron of power and chaos. It reminds you that accepting change is necessary to sustain yourself in the world.
5 | The birds in the sky are evidence that even the smallest creatures can survive if they remain above the fray.
6 | As demonstrated by the actions of the wolf, an individual's strength is nothing compared to the power of the pack.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Mentors</name>
      <text>It's not unusual for would-be druids to seek out (or be sought out by) instructors or elders who teach them the basics of their magical arts. Most druids who learn from a mentor begin their training at a young age, and the mentor has a vital role in shaping a student's attitudes and beliefs.
	If your character received training from someone else, who or what was that individual, and what was the nature of your relationship? Did your mentor imbue you with a particular outlook or otherwise influence your approach to achieving the goals of your chosen path?

Mentors:
d6 | Mentors
1 | Your mentor was a wise treant who taught you to think in terms of years and decades rather than days or months.
2 | You were tutored by a dryad who watched over a slumbering portal to the Abyss. During your training, you were tasked with watching for hidden threats to the world.
3 | Your tutor always interacted with you in the form of a falcon. You never saw the tutor's humanoid form.
4 | You were one of several youngsters who were mentored by an old druid, until one of your fellow pupils betrayed your group and killed your master.
5 | Your mentor has appeared to you only in visions. You have yet to meet this person, and you are not sure such a person exists in mortal form.
6 | Your mentor was a werebear who taught you to treat all living things with equal regard.</text>

        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of Dreams</name>
        <text>Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild and its dreamlike realms. The druids' guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they protect are gleaming, fruitful places, where dream and reality blur together and where the weary can find rest.

The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent.
	You regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

        <text>At 14th level, the magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands.
	When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: dream (with you as the messenger), scrying, or teleportation circle.
	This use of teleportation circle is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you haven't taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn't wasted.
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Shepherd</name>
        <text>Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds.
	Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.

        <text>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.
	You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. In addition, beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn't grant you friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.

        <name>Spirit Totem (Circle of the Shepherd)</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.
	As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.
	The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
	The effect of the spirit's aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.

Bear Spirit. The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.

Hawk Spirit. The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit's aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.

Unicorn Spirit. The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit's aura. In addition, if you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.
