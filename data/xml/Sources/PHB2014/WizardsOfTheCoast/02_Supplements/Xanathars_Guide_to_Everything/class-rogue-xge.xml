    <name>Rogue</name>
    <trait>
      <name>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</name>
      <text>"People forget that the entire point of venturing down into a dusty tomb is to bring back the prizes hidden away there. Fighting is for fools. Dead men can't spend their fortunes."
— Barnabas Bladecutter

When brute force won't get the job done, or when magic isn't available or appropriate, the rogue rises to the fore. With skills tied to stealth, subterfuge, and trickery, rogues can get into and out of trouble in ways that few other characters can emulate.
	Some rogues who turn to adventuring are former criminals who have decided that dodging monsters is preferable to remaining one step ahead of the law. Others are professional killers in search of a profitable application of their talents between contracts. Some simply love the thrill of overcoming any challenge that stands in their way.
	On adventures, a rogue is likely to mix an outwardly cautious approach—few rogues enjoy combat—with a ravenous hunger for loot. Most of the time, in a rogue's mind, taking up arms against a creature is not about killing the creature but about becoming the new owner of its treasure.
	The following sections explore certain facets of what it means to be a rogue, which you can use to add depth to your character.

      <name>Guilty Pleasures</name>
      <text>Most of what rogues do revolves around obtaining treasure and preventing others from doing the same. Little gets in the way of attaining those goals, except that many rogues are enticed away from that path by a compulsion that clouds their thinking—an irresistible need that must be satisfied, even if doing so is risky.
	A rogue's guilty pleasure could be the acquisition of a physical item, something to be experienced, or a way of conducting oneself at certain times. One rogue might not be able to pass up any loot made of silver, for instance, even if said loot is hanging around the neck of a castle guard. Another one can't go through a day in the city without lifting a purse or two, just to keep in practice.
	What's the one form of temptation that your rogue character can't resist when the opportunity presents itself, even if giving into it might mean trouble for you and your companions?

Guilty Pleasures:
d6 | Pleasure
1 | Large gems
2 | A smile from a pretty face
3 | A new ring for your finger
4 | The chance to deflate someone's ego
5 | The finest food and drink
6 | Adding to your collection of exotic coins</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Adversaries</name>
      <text>Naturally, those who enforce the law are bound to come up against those who break it, and it's the rare rogue who isn't featured on at least one wanted poster. Beyond that, it's in the nature of their profession that rogues often come into contact with criminal elements, whether out of choice or necessity. Some of those people can be adversaries too, and they're likely to be harder to deal with than the average member of the city watch.
	If your character's backstory doesn't already include a personage of this sort, you could work with your DM to come up with a reason why an adversary has appeared in your life. Perhaps you've been the subject of scrutiny for a while from someone who wants to use you for nefarious purposes and has just now become known to you. Such an incident could be the basis for an upcoming adventure.
	Does your rogue character have an adversary who also happens to be a criminal? If so, how is this relationship affecting your life?

Adversaries:
d6 | Adversary
1 | The pirate captain on whose ship you once served; what you call moving on, the captain calls mutiny
2 | A master spy to whom you unwittingly fed bad information, which led to the assassination of the wrong target
3 | The master of the local thieves' guild, who wants you to join the organization or leave town
4 | An art collector who uses illegal means to acquire masterpieces
5 | A fence who uses you as a messenger to set up illicit meetings
6 | The proprietor of an illegal pit fighting arena where you once took bets</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Benefactor</name>
      <text>Few rogues make it far in life before needing someone's help, which means thereafter owing that benefactor a significant debt.
	If your character's backstory doesn't already include a personage of this sort, you could work with your DM to determine why a benefactor has appeared in your life. Perhaps you benefited from something your benefactor did for you without realizing who was responsible, and that person has now just become known to you. Who helped you in the past, whether or not you knew it at the time, and what do you owe that person as recompense?

Benefactors:
d6 | Benefactor
1 | A smuggler kept you from getting caught but lost a valuable shipment in doing so. Now you owe that person an equally valuable favor.
2 | The Beggar King has hidden you from your pursuers many times, in return for future considerations.
3 | A magistrate once kept you out of jail in return for information on a powerful crime lord.
4 | Your parents used their savings to bail you out of trouble in your younger days and are now destitute.
5 | A dragon didn't eat you when it had a chance, and in return you promised to set aside choice pieces of treasure for it.
6 | A druid once helped you out of a tight spot; now any random animal you see could be that benefactor, perhaps come to claim a return favor.</text>

You rely on your sharp eye for detail, but also on your finely honed ability to read the words and deeds of other creatures to determine their true intent.

        <text>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to decipher an opponent's tactics and develop a counter to them. As a bonus action, you can make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature you can see that isn't incapacitated, contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If you succeed, you can use your Sneak Attack against that target even if you don't have advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have disadvantage on it.
	This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you successfully use this feature against a different target.

You sense that an effect is attempting to trick you, but you gain no insight into what is hidden or into its true nature.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:

	• Intelligence score
	• Wisdom score
	• Charisma score
	• Class levels (if any)

At the DM's option, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature's history or one of its personality traits, if it has any.

	Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic.

	If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.
	If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.
