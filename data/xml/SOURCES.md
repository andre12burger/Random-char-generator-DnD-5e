# Fight Club 5e XML

This page is dedicated to helping you make your own XML files to be imported in the FightClub5e app. This is the tutorial found in the app but modified a bit, plus advice on how to add your own sources or homebrew to the repository.

## [Elements and Tags](#fightclub5e-xml)

The basic unit of an XML document is an element. It consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. The start tag is represented using ```<abc>```, while the end tag is represented using ```</abc>```. The "abc" is the element name that is between '&lt;' and '&gt;'. The description of that element is written between the start and end tags.

For example, ```<name>Wizard</name>```, is an element named, "name" and is set to "Wizard". If you're not using an element, you can either delete it or type it in this manner, '```<spells/>```'. It's usually used when you paste a template of something so you copy an element that you may or may not use in this way so that if you wish to use it, you simply delete the '/', type the content inside, and end it with the appropriate closing tag.

If you want to start a new paragraph and want to leave a line out (when writing item description, for example), you insert a '&lt;text /&gt;' element.

## [Terminology](#fightclub5e-xml)

The content for elements will consist of text, numbers, dice rolls, formulas, or otherwise specified values.

Here are the content we'll be using :

  - **ABC**. Any text may be inputted. There are a few characters that can't be used. &, &lt;, &gt;. These characters must be replaced with ```&amp;```, ```&lt;```, and ```&gt;```, respectively
  - **###**. Any number may be inputted. Only unformated numbers are acceptable, meaning remove any commas and other characters, except for dots for decimal point numbers.
  - **D20**. A dice roll formula. For example, "1d10+5", "5d6", or "3d3+1d7-2". Use 'd' to denote a die. + and - operators are acceptable. Remove any white spaces.
  - The | denotes that the element can take a specific value from the given list. Acceptable values are separated the | character.
  - Some elements take multiple values. Acceptable values are separated by commas.

For example, when you see "name (ABC)" throughout the tutorial, that says the element's name is "name" and it takes text as its content, as in ```<name>Gandalf the Grey</name>```. "classes (ABC, ABC, ...)" says the classes element takes multiple text strings, as in, ```<classes>Fighter, Wizard</classes>```.

## [Creating an XML file](#fightclub5e-xml)

Making your own file is an easy but time-consuming job. But you've come to the right place if you want to learn how to do it!

First off you'll need a Text Editor. You can definitely write everything using the default text editor on your machine, but there are applications that make the process much easier. I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) since they are easy to use and have a lot of great features. Now that you've downloaded a text editor, let's begin!

The file must begin with the following line: ```<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>```. The first required element is `<compendium>`. The element must contain an attribute named, "version" with its value set to "5". You can add an optional "auto_indent" attribute with the value `YES` or `NO`, if set to YES the app will try to indent your text for you, if set to NO it will use the text as written. The content for the compendium element will be your lists of spells, items, creatures, races, classes, backgrounds, and/or feats.

This is what your file should currently look like:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<compendium version="5" auto_indent="NO">
  your content
</compendium>
```

Remember that every opening tag needs an accompanying ending tag. The compendium element may optionally take the auto_indent attribute with a value set to "YES" or "NO." Yes means certain text descriptions elements will automatically indent paragraphs. Ex: ```<compendium version="5" auto_indent="NO">```

## [Spells](#fightclub5e-xml)

A spell is defined using an element named spell. Its content will consist of several elements, which will define your spell. The following is a list of elements that can be used:

  - **name** (ABC)
  - **level** (##)
  - **school** (A | C | D | EN | EV | I | N | T) Spell school
    - **A** = abjuration
    - **C** = conjuration
    - **D** = divination
    - **EN** = enchantment
    - **EV** = evocation
    - **I** = illusion
    - **N** = necromancy
    - **T** = transmutation
  - **classes** (ABC, ABC, ...)
  - **ritual** (YES | NO) *This element may be left out if the spell is not a ritual.*
  - **time** (ABC) Casting time
  - **range** (ABC)
  - **components** (V, S, M (ABC))
    - **V** = vocal
    - **S** = somatic
    - **M** = material
    - **(ABC)** = A description of the material used by the spell. *Must be enclosed in parentheses.*
  - **duration** (ABC)
  - **text** (ABC) Spell description. *Multiple text elements may be inputted. Each one represents a paragraph. If the auto_indent attribute is set in the compendium element, paragraphs after the first will automatically indent the first line.*
  - **roll** (D20) Dice roll formulas. *Ability modifiers can be inputted using STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, and CHA. To input the class spell ability modifier, use SPELL, and to add your proficiency bonus, add PROF.*

Spell example:
```xml
<spell>
  <name>Magic Missile</name>
  <level>1</level>
  <school>EV</school>
  <classes>Fighter (Eldritch Knight), Sorcerer, Wizard</classes>
  <time>1 action</time>
  <range>120 feet</range>
  <components>V, S</components>
  <duration>Instantaneous</duration>
  <text>You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4+1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.</text>
  <text/>
  <text>At Higher Levels:</text>
  <text>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot above 1st.</text>
  <text/>
  <text>Source:	Player's Handbook (2014) p. 257</text>
  <roll>1d4+1</roll>
  <roll>(1d4+1)+(1d4+1)+(1d4+1)</roll>
</spell>
```

Roll modifiers:
```xml
  <roll>xdx+%0</roll> <!-- add Spellcasting Ability -->
  <roll>xdx+%1</roll> <!-- add STR MOD -->
  <roll>xdx+%2</roll> <!-- add DEX MOD -->
  <roll>xdx+%3</roll> <!-- add CON MOD -->
  <roll>xdx+%4</roll> <!-- add INT MOD -->
  <roll>xdx+%5</roll> <!-- add WIS MOD -->
  <roll>xdx+%6</roll> <!-- add CHA MOD -->
  <roll>xdx+%7</roll> <!-- add LVL -->
  <roll>xdx+%8</roll> <!-- add PROF -->
  <roll>xdx+%9</roll> <!-- add current HP -->
  <roll>xdx+%10</roll> <!-- add LVL 1/2 -->
  <roll>xdx+1o</roll> <!-- add 1wo -->
  <roll>xdx+1w</roll> <!-- add 1w -->
```

For the Github repository, if you're adding a new class to a spell or want to add a new spell list, you can create a new XML file with spell names, and the class or classes you would like to add, as shown in the example below:

```xml
<spell>
  <name>Magic Missile</name>
  <classes>Bard (Esoteric)</classes>
</spell>
```

These will be merged during compilation into a single spell with all the additional classes.

  <text>Ammo: arrow</text>
  <text/>
  <text>Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</text>
  <text/>
  <text>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").</text>
  <text/>
  <text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</text>
  <text/>
  <text>Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</text>
  <text/>
  <text>Heavy: Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</text>
  <text/>
  <text>Proficiency: martial, longbow</text>

	• A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

	• Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads a round corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn.

	• Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.

	• Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.

  <description>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.

Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.

Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.

True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.

Dragon Age Categories:
Category | Size | Age Range
Wyrmling | Medium | 5 years or less
Young | Large | 6-100 years
Adult | Huge | 101-800 years
Ancient | Gargantuan | 801 years or more

    <text>Sea elves fell in love with the wild beauty of the ocean in the earliest days of the multiverse.

Today these elves can be found wherever oceans exist, as well as in the Elemental Plane of Water.</text>
    <text/>
    <text>Like other elves, sea elves can live to be over 750 years old.</text>

Background example:
```xml
<background>
  <name>Acolyte</name>
  <proficiency>Insight, Religion</proficiency>
  <trait>
    <name>Description</name>
    <text>You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.</text>
    <text/>
    <text>Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. The Gods of the Multiverse section contains a sample pantheon, from the Forgotten Realms setting. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.</text>
    <text/>
    <text>	• Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion</text>
    <text>	• Languages: Two of your choice</text>
    <text>	• Equipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp</text>
    <text/>
    <text>Source:	Player's Handbook (2014) p. 127</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Feature: Shelter of the Faithful</name>
    <text>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.</text>
    <text/>
    <text>You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
    <text>Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.</text>
    <text/>
    <text>d8 | Personality Trait</text>
    <text>1 | I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example.</text>
    <text>2 | I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.</text>
    <text>3 | I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen.</text>
    <text>4 | Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude.</text>
    <text>5 | I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation.</text>
    <text>6 | I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods.</text>
    <text>7 | I've enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple's elite. Rough living grates on me.</text>
    <text>8 | I've spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world.</text>
    <text/>
    <text>d6 | Ideal</text>
    <text>1 | Tradition. The ancient traditions of worship and sacrifice must be preserved and upheld. (Lawful)</text>
    <text>2 | Charity. I always try to help those in need, no matter what the personal cost. (Good)</text>
    <text>3 | Change. We must help bring about the changes the gods are constantly working in the world. (Chaotic)</text>
    <text>4 | Power. I hope to one day rise to the top of my faith's religious hierarchy. (Lawful)</text>
    <text>5 | Faith. I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have faith that if I work hard, things will go well. (Lawful)</text>
    <text>6 | Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of my god's favor by matching my actions against his or her teachings. (Any)</text>
    <text/>
    <text>d6 | Bond</text>
    <text>1 | I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago.</text>
    <text>2 | I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a heretic.</text>

    <text>4 | Everything I do is for the common people.</text>
    <text>5 | I will do anything to protect the temple where I served.</text>
    <text>6 | I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies consider heretical and seek to destroy.</text>
    <text/>
    <text>d6 | Flaw</text>
    <text>1 | I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely.</text>
    <text>2 | I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy.</text>
    <text>3 | My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god.</text>
    <text>4 | I am inflexible in my thinking.</text>
    <text>5 | I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.</text>
    <text>6 | Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life.</text>
  </trait>
</background>
```

	• Increase your walking speed by 5 feet.

	• You gain proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill (your choice). If you're already proficient in the skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with it.

# The FightClub5eXML Github Repository

## [Adding a Source](#fightclub5e-xml)

New material is added to D&D quite frequently, especially through Unearthed Arcana which is typically used for beta testing, people creating their own homebrew, and third party indie publishers. Keeping each source in its own file makes it easier to add new content and select which sources you want to include in your Compendium.

Each source is like its own Compendium, and could potentially be imported on its own, with two exceptions (classes and spells) which are explained below. The structure of the XML file should be:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<compendium version="5" auto_indent="NO">
  <!-- Items -->
  <!-- Races -->
  <!-- Classes -->
  <!-- Feats -->
  <!-- Backgrounds -->
  <!-- Spells -->
  <!-- Monsters -->
</compendium>
```

Add the specific elements under the appropriate comment (e.g. `<item>...</item>` goes under `<!-- Items -->`). See the Fight Club Import Tutorial for the format of each element, or use our existing sources as a foundation. You can also check out the schema we use for validation in `Utilities/compendium.xsd`.

When merged with other sources (see "Build Your Own Compendium" below), items, races, feats, backgrounds, and monsters are all added to the resulting Compendium. It's recommended that subraces be added as their own race. Classes and spells, however, are merged when their names match, making it easier to add subclasses without modifying existing sources.

For the repository, it's recommended to split the content of the sources into separate files, and put them into a subfolder named after the content you're adding to make them more manageable. The folder and file names may not contain spaces or quotes to be imported, files are tagged with an abbreviation of the content's name.

Example:  
- Tashas_Cauldron_of_Everything
  - bestiary-tce.xml
  - backgrounds-tce.xml
  - class-classname-tce.xml
  - feats-tce.xml
  - items-tce.xml
  - optionalfeatures-tce.xml (Used for special features such as fighting maneuvers, warlock invocations, monk techniques, etc. Usually set up as level 0 spells.)
  - races-tce.xml
  - spells-phb+tce.xml (Spell lists for subclasses that are merged with PHB content.)
  - spells-tce.xml

### [Subclasses](#fightclub5e-xml)

Adding a subclass in Fight Club is as easy as adding new `<autolevel>` tags to a class. When selecting sources for a Compendium, the merge finds classes with matching `<name>` tags and appends the `<autolevel>` tags to the end.

```xml
<class>
  <name>Barbarian</name>
  <autolevel level="3">
    <feature optional="YES">...</feature>
  </autolevel>
  ...
</class>
```

Because the rest of the class data is not included, this means you would need to include the original source of the class in your Compendium as well.

### [Spells](#fightclub5e-xml)

In the Fight Club compendium, spell lists are defined by the spell, not the class. If you want to add a spell to a class list, you would need to modify the spell's `<classes>` tag. This can be done without modifying the original spell by adding only the name and new class in your source XML. During the Compendium merge, the value of `<classes>` is concatenated to any matching spells.

New source:

```xml
<spell>
  <name>Acid Splash</name>
  <classes>Artificer</classes>
</spell>
```

Resulting merge with original source:

```xml
<spell>
  <name>Acid Splash</name>
  <level>0</level>
  <school>C</school>
  ...
  <classes>Fighter, Rogue, Sorcerer, Wizard, Artificer</classes>
  ...
</spell>
```

Just like classes, the original source would be required in order for the full spell details to appear in the Compendium.

## [Manual Validation](#fightclub5e-xml)

While you add to XML source files, you can manually validate the XML to catch any errors.

You can find an online XML Linter or use xmllint in the command line. The schema files are in the Utilities folder.

Here is an example, running xmllint at the top level of the repo, using the compendium schema to validate an XML file in Sources:

```bash
xmllint --noout --schema Utilities/compendium.xsd Sources/CoreRulebooks.xml
```

## [Build Your Own Compendium](#fightclub5e-xml)

### [Create a collection file](#fightclub5e-xml)

A collection file is an XML file that lists which sources you want to merge into your custom Compendium. It can include source files in one of two ways:

---

### Method 1: Using `<doc href="..."/>`

This method is simple and common. Your collection file lists one or more `<doc>` elements, each referencing an XML file containing the source content. Each referenced XML file must have a `<compendium>` root element.

Example (assuming your file is inside the `Collections` directory):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<collection>
  <doc href="../Sources/PHB2014/WizardsOfTheCoast/01_PlayersHandbook.xml" />
  <doc href="../Sources/PHB2014/WizardsOfTheCoast/02_DungeonMastersGuide.xml" />
  <doc href="../Sources/PHB2014/WizardsOfTheCoast/03_MonsterManual.xml" />
</collection>
```

- You can include one or more `<doc>` entries.
- The `href` attribute points to the relative path of the source XML file.
- Each source XML file should contain a `<compendium>` root element.
- The collection file name determines the name of the final merged Compendium.

---

### Method 2: Using XInclude `<xi:include>`

Alternatively, you can build your collection using the XML XInclude standard. This method lets you include external XML files directly into your collection file by reference and selectively include specific XML nodes using XPointer expressions.

Typically, the `<xi:include>` elements point to **partial collection XML files** located inside source folders (e.g. `partial-collection-foldername.xml`). These partial collection files list multiple source XML files (like `source-*.xml`) using `<doc>` elements nested inside `<collection>`. The partial collection files themselves can be automatically generated with the utility explained in the next section.

Example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<collection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
  <xi:include href="../Sources/PHB2014/WizardsOfTheCoast/collection-wizardsofthecoast.xml" xpointer="xpointer(/collection/doc)" />
  <xi:include href="../Sources/PHB2014/PartneredContent/collection-partneredcontent.xml" xpointer="xpointer(/collection/doc)" />
  <xi:include href="../Sources/PHB2014/Homebrew/collection-homebrew.xml" xpointer="xpointer(/collection/doc)" />
</collection>
```

* The `xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"` namespace declaration is required.
* Each `<xi:include>` tag includes an external XML partial collection file.
* The xpointer attribute typically uses `xpointer="xpointer(/collection/doc)"` since partial collection files contain `<doc>` elements inside a `<collection>`.
* The partial collection files list individual source-*.xml files with `<doc href="..."/>`.
* Each source-*.xml file contains a `<source>` root with its own `<collection>` of `<doc>` elements.
* This nested structure allows modular inclusion and organization of sources.
* Adjust the xpointer if your included XML files have a different internal structure.

### Utility: Generating Partial Collection Files Automatically

To help automate the creation of partial collection files, you can use a utility script located in the Utilities folder. The script generates the partial files by taking the path to a folder containing your source files:

```bash
/Utilities/source-xml-collector.sh /path/to/source/
```

- This script scans a directory you specify for all `source-*.xml` files which contains a `<collection>` inside the `<source>` root element, containing one or more `<doc>` elements.
- It generates a partial `collection.xml` file **inside that same directory**.
- The generated collection file lists each found source file as an `<xi:include>` entry with appropriate attributes and correct `xpointer`.
- This helps quickly assemble partial collections without manually writing the XML.

---

### Summary

- Use `<doc href="..."/>` for a simple, straightforward listing of source XML files.
- Use `<xi:include>` when you want to leverage XML XInclude's ability to include and merge partial collections into complete XML documents.
- Remember to use the correct `xpointer` expression depending on the XML file's internal structure:
  - `/collection/doc` for root-level collections
  - `/source/collection/doc` for partial collections nested inside source files
- Both methods result in a collection file that merges multiple source XMLs into one Compendium.
- The collection file's name will be used as the name of the resulting merged Compendium.
- Use `/Utilities/source-xml-collector.sh` to auto-generate partial collection files inside any directory containing your source XMLs.

### [Execute the merge](#fightclub5e-xml)

With your collection in place, you're ready to build your Compendium by merging the sources together.

See the instructions to `Compile a Collection Into a Compendium` in the root-level [README](/README.md).
