    <text>You have learned a number of spells that you can cast as rituals. These spells are written in a ritual book, which you must have in hand while casting one of them.
	When you choose this feat, you acquire a ritual book holding two 1st-level cleric spells of your choice. The spells you choose must have the ritual tag. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
	If you come across a spell in written form, such as a magical spell scroll or a wizard's spellbook, you might be able to add it to your ritual book. The spell must be on the cleric spell list, the spell's level can be no higher than half your level (rounded up), and it must have the ritual tag. The process of copying the spell into your ritual book takes 2 hours per level of the spell, and costs 50 gp per level. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.

    <name>Dark Gift: Echoing Soul</name>
    <text>Your soul isn't your own or, at least, it wasn't always yours. Whether you've lived past lives, your soul was swapped into a different body, or you have a link connecting you to another being, you experience echoes from another life. These echoes grant you knowledge, talents, or even languages you can't always explain, but they also intrude on your perceptions and beliefs unexpectedly.
	Roll on or choose an option from the Soul Echoes table to determine the nature of this Dark Gift. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.

Soul Echoes:
d6 | Echo
1 | My soul is linked with that of a person elsewhere, perhaps another domain, world, or plane.
2 | I have lived many times before, my soul reincarnating each time I die rather than passing on.
3 | My consciousness was removed from my original body and implanted in this one.
4 | I was physically and spiritually merged with another being.
5 | I share my body with an intangible, otherworldly force.
6 | Time fractures around me, and I sometimes collide with my own past or future.

Channeled Prowess. You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

Inherent Tongue. You can speak, read, and write one additional language of your choice.

Intrusive Echoes. Immediately after you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, your soul's memories emerge and overtake your perceptions and experiences. You might see people around you as someone other than who they are, or you become disoriented by a double-experience of the world around you. Roll on the Intrusive Echoes table to determine the effect of these vivid memories and perceptions. Once one of effects occur, these intrusive echoes can't manifest again until you finish a short or long rest.

Intrusive Echoes:
d6 | Effect
1 | You are charmed by a creature you can see (of the DM's choice) for 1 minute or until the creature damages you.
2 | You are frightened by a creature you can see (of the DM's choice) for 1 minute, or until the creature damages you.
3 | You perceive another time or place around you until the end of your next turn. During this time, you are blinded to your actual surroundings.
4 | You perceive a different time or place overlapping your surroundings. Your speed is halved until the end of your next turn.
5 | Memories and sensations overwhelm you. You are incapacitated until the start of your next turn.
6 | Your memory is one of triumph. You can reroll the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that you just made. You must use the new roll.

    <name>Dark Gift: Gathered Whispers</name>
    <text>You are haunted by spiritual beings, whether the souls of the departed or entities from another plane. Their voices endlessly whisper, taunt, or cajole, sometimes rising to unearthly howls. Only you can perceive the spirits, unless you allow them to speak through you. The spirits are intangible and invisible; anyone who can see invisible creatures sees only fleeting glimpses of these spirits as they haunt you.
	Roll on or choose an option from the Whispering Spirits table to determine what haunts you. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.

Whispering Spirits:
d6 | Spirits
1 | A council of my dead ancestors watches over me.
2 | Fiendish presences vie for my soul.
3 | Unquiet souls are drawn to me and beg for peace.
4 | The spirits of those I killed linger around me.
5 | An alien intelligence intrudes upon my thoughts.
6 | A sibling I don't have shares my body.

Spirit Whispers. You learn the message cantrip if you don't already know it, and require no components to cast it. When you cast the spell, the messages are delivered by one of your whispering spirits rather than you or the target's voice. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice when you gain this Dark Gift).

Sudden Cacophony. When you are hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to channel your haunting spirits, letting their voices howl through you. If the attacker isn't deafened, add your proficiency bonus to your AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. Once this trait causes an attack to miss, you can't use the trait again until you finish a long rest.

Voices from Beyond. Immediately after you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, the haunting voices grow too loud to ignore. Roll on the Voices from Beyond table to determine the effect of these voices. Once one of these effects occurs, none of these haunting voices manifest again until you finish a short or long rest.

Voices from Beyond:
d4 | Effect
1 | You have disadvantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make.
2 | You are deafened by the voices for 1 minute.
3 | You are frightened of the creature closest to you, other than yourself, until the end of your next turn. If multiple creatures are closest, the DM chooses which creature you are frightened of.
4 | Within the next 10 minutes, you can ask your spirits about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. You can receive an omen as if you had cast the augury spell. The omen manifests as whisperings from your spirits perceptible only to you.

    <name>Dark Gift: Living Shadow</name>
    <text>The shadow you cast is animate and ever-present, even when lighting conditions would otherwise prevent it. Your shadow occasionally moves out of sync with you. Sometimes it appears to be undertaking random but mundane tasks, while at other times it acts out your darker impulses, threatening or even attacking other shadows. With effort, you can bend this shadow puppetry to your will.
	Roll on or choose an option from the Shadow Quirk table to determine how your living shadow behaves. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.

Shadow Quirk:
d6 | Quirk
1 | My shadow often holds weapons or bears wounds that don't exist.
2 | When I'm distracted, my shadow panics and tries to get other people's attention, as if it's desperate to escape me.
3 | When it's not being watched, my shadow makes threatening gestures or creeps toward people.
4 | My shadow's movements mirror mine incorrectly—when I raise my left hand, my shadow moves its right.
5 | My shadow fiddles with or occasionally breaks Tiny, nonmagical objects.
6 | There's a slight but noticeable delay between my movements and those of my shadow.

Grasping Shadow. You learn the mage hand cantrip if you don't already know it, and require no components to cast it. The hand created by the spell is shadowy but is not bound to your actual shadow. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice when you gain this Dark Gift).

Shadow Strike. When you make a melee attack roll, you can increase your reach for that attack by 10 feet. Your shadow stretches and delivers the attack as if it were you. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Ominous Will. Immediately after you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, your shadow exerts a will of its own and might assist or hinder you or those around you. The next time you or a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, roll a d4. If the number is odd, reduce the total by the number rolled. If the number is even, increase the total by the number rolled. Once this effect occurs, it can't happen again until you finish a short or long rest.

    <name>Dark Gift: Mist Walker</name>
    <text>The Mists grip all who tread the Domains of Dread, but you know how to slip through their grasp. You can navigate the Mists successfully given enough time and a little luck, but this freedom comes with a price; if you remain in one area for too long, the Mists find you and drain your life force.
	Roll on or choose an option from the Misty Travels table to determine how you developed this Dark Gift. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.

Misty Travels:
d4 | Origin
1 | You learned a secret about the nature of the Mists. Ever since, you can manipulate them, but the lands you walk have turned against you.
2 | You fled into the Mists to escape someone or something that's hunting you. You can never rest for long, knowing you're still being pursued.
3 | You're part of an organization, a family, or an itinerant community with experience traveling the Mists. They taught you how to do the same.
4 | The Mists stole you from your home and fractured your memories of where you're from. You've been on a quest to find your way back ever since.

Misty Step. You can cast the misty step spell, requiring no spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice when you gain this Dark Gift). If you have spell slots of 2nd level or higher, you can cast this spell with them.

Mist Traveler. When you enter the Mists intent on reaching a specific domain, you are treated as if you possess a Mist talisman keyed to that domain. To use this trait, you must know the name of the domain you have chosen as your destination, but you don't need to have previously visited that land. This trait doesn't allow you to bypass domain borders closed by a Darklord's will.

Poisoned Roots. When you finish a long rest, the world around you in a 10-mile radius becomes a siphon that will eventually leech away your vitality. You can remain in the area safely for a number of weeks equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 week). Thereafter, each time you finish a long rest in the area, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion that can't be removed while you remain in the area.

    <name>Dark Gift: Second Skin</name>
    <text>There is another side of you that most people never see. When you show this side of yourself, you might become another person entirely, a celestial-like avenger, or a walking nightmare. Whatever the specifics of this form, it exaggerates some drive or hidden nature within you.
	Roll on or choose an option from the Second Form table to determine this other side of yourself. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.

Second Form:
d6 | Form
1 | An exaggerated version of your own form
2 | Hybrid form of humanoid and beast
3 | An angelic, a demonic, or an aberrant form
4 | A vaguely human-shaped creature made of slime
5 | A fey-like shape, either brooding or passionate
6 | A body constructed of metal, stone, or machinery

Transformation. You can cast the alter self spell to appear in your second form. When you do so, you gain the effects of that spell's Change Appearance option and cannot end it to gain the benefits of a different option. Casting alter self in this way requires no spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice when you gain this Dark Gift). If you have spell slots of 2nd level or higher, you can cast this spell with them.
	When you cast alter self using this feature, some cosmetic aspect of your second form remains after the spell ends. This visibly marks you unless you actively hide or disguise it. The mark is a perceptible change such as scaly skin, stunted wings, eyes without pupils, or horns. The mark fades after you finish a long rest.

Involuntary Change. Certain circumstances can activate your Dark Gift. After you experience this catalyst, at the start of your next turn you must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or use your action to cast alter self as described in the Transformation trait, even if you have already used it.
	Roll on or choose an option from the Change Catalyst table to determine what triggers your involuntary change.

Change Catalyst:
d6 | Catalyst
1 | Seeing a particular phase of the moon
2 | The smell of a certain type of flower
3 | The sound of ringing temple bells
4 | Hearing a particular melody
5 | Touching pure silver with your bare skin
6 | Seeing someone resembling a specific individual

    <name>Dark Gift: Symbiotic Being</name>
    <text>A second being resides within your body along with you. It manifests physically somewhere on you and relies on you for its survival. At the same time, it offers you knowledge and other assistance, either of its own volition or because of your intertwined nature. The symbiote has its own personality and agenda, which might be at odds with yours. If you ignore the symbiote's desires, it might strive to interfere with you. There is no way to be rid of the symbiote while you have this Dark Gift. Even if you go to drastic lengths, such as severing the part of your body where the symbiote resides, it reappears on your body in another location at the next midnight.
	Roll on or choose an option from the Symbiotic Nature table to determine what sort of symbiotic being shares your body. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.

Symbiotic Nature:
d6 | Symbiote
1 | Tiny humanoid facial features protruding from your torso, palm, or the back of your head
2 | An alien appendage inside an unhealing wound
3 | A burrowing, worm-like being
4 | An intrusive thought that inhabits your mind
5 | A living tattoo
6 | Crystal growths that replace a portion of your body

Entwined Existence. Your symbiote is a separate entity with its own physical form bound to yours. It isn't a separate creature and relies on you to survive. It has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The DM sets the symbiote's abilities or determines them randomly (roll 4d6 for each score, ignoring the lowest roll and totaling the rest). The symbiote can see and hear using your senses.
	The symbiote speaks, reads, and understands two languages; one that you speak, as well as one appropriate to its nature. Choose one of the following skills: Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Religion, Perception, or Persuasion. You gain proficiency in that skill if you don't already have it, representing the symbiote's counsel and guidance.
	If you die, so does your symbiote. If you are subsequently returned to life, your symbiote revives as well.

Sustained Symbiosis. Your symbiote has a vested interest in your survival and takes steps to ensure it. When you fail a saving throw, you can choose to have your symbiote expend one of your Hit Dice to roll it and add the number rolled to the saving throw, potentially turning the failure into a success. If it uses this feature on a death saving throw, you succeed on the save and regain 1 hit point regardless of the number rolled on the d20.
	Once you succeed on a saving throw due to this trait, the symbiote can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Symbiotic Agenda. Your symbiote has an agenda that drives it, and it expects you to assist it in achieving those goals. How permissive or patient it is in resolving its agenda depends on its personality (work with your DM to determine these details). If you have an opportunity to advance its agenda and don't act on it, the symbiote can try to force your hand. You must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 + the symbiote's Charisma modifier) or be charmed by the symbiote for 1d12 hours. While charmed, you must try to follow the symbiote's commands. If you take damage that is not self-inflicted, you can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
	Roll or choose from the Symbiotic Agenda table to determine the symbiote's goal, working with your DM to detail the specifics or create another agenda.

Symbiotic Agenda:
d6 | Agenda
1 | The symbiote seeks to destroy a specific type of being, such as fiends, trolls, or paladins.
2 | The symbiote craves knowledge and is determined to solve a mystery or learn a secret.
3 | The symbiote wants to bring a prophecy to fruition or to thwart one.
4 | The symbiote seeks to defend the servants and interests of a powerful being or organization.
5 | The symbiote wants to keep you from harm at all costs and believes it knows what's best for you.
6 | The symbiote seeks to experience new sensations, the more bizarre the better.

    <name>Dark Gift: Touch of Death</name>
    <text>Your touch is pain, harming whoever you come in contact with. The deathly power within you is beyond your control, afflicting any who touch your bare skin. By the same token, you can deliver death to your enemies with your touch.
	Roll on or choose an option from the Deadly Touch table to determine how this Dark Gift presents itself. Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.

Deadly Touch:
d6 | Manifestation
1 | Your body is alchemically or biologically altered, infusing you with deadly chemicals.
2 | The magic of a slighted druid or fey makes small plants wither and insects die in your presence.
3 | You're the harbinger of a grim prophecy. Any creature your touch damages is marked with a temporary scar of a group, fiend, deity, or other force that takes an interest in you.
4 | You survived a near-death experience—but shouldn't have. Ever since, death and ill omens follow you.
5 | You are out of sync with time or reality. Anything you touch is warped by the distortion.
6 | Every time you touch a creature, you hear the laughter of someone you once harmed.

Death Touch. You can focus your deadly touch against your foes. As an action, make one unarmed strike. On a hit, the target takes an additional 1d10 necrotic damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

Inescapable Death. When you hit a target with an attack roll and deal necrotic damage, you ignore the target's resistance to that damage.

Withering Contact. When you start your turn grappling a creature or grappled by it, the creature takes 1d10 necrotic damage.

    <name>Dark Gift: Watchers</name>
    <text>Something is always watching you and draws ethereal spirits that take the form of creatures made of shadowstuff, usually in the shape of Tiny beasts, that follow you and gather in your general vicinity. These creatures act like normal examples of their kind, but their behavior suggests a hint of malice. No matter what precautions you take, you can't permanently drive these spirits away. They always return, wait just beyond the reach of deterrents, or later crawl out of your clothes and equipment.
	Roll on or choose an option from the Watchers table to determine what sorts of forms the spirits typically take when they follow you.

Watchers:
d8 | Watchers
1 | Carrion Eaters. Jackals, ravens, vultures
2 | Inescapable Judgments. Animate tools of punishment, drifting eyeballs, religious iconography
3 | Night Wings. Bats, moths, owls
4 | Plague Carriers. Fleas, rats, squirrels
5 | Unnatural Observers. Animate objects, clockwork devices, otherworldly voyeurs
6 | Sea Skulkers. Crabs, eels, jellyfish
7 | Stray Souls. Ghost orbs, shadows, ectoplasmic wisps
8 | Venomous Vermin. Scorpions, serpents, spiders

Borrowed Eyes. As an action, you can influence the presence guiding the watchers for 1 hour. For the duration, you gain advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and you can't be blinded. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Dread Presence. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Performance), and Charisma (Persuasion) checks made against creatures that can see the watchers, and you have disadvantage on saving throws made against the scrying spell.
	You can temporarily disperse or hide the watchers with some effort. With 1 minute of work and a successful DC 15 Charisma (Animal Handling) check, you can suppress your Borrowed Eyes and Dread Presence for 1 hour. Once you successfully suppress these features, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

    <prerequisite>4th level, Strike of the Giants (Storm Strike) Feat</prerequisite>
    <text>You've manifested the tempest magic emblematic of storm giants, granting you the following benefits:

Ability Score Increase: Increase your Strength, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

Maelstrom Aura: As a bonus action, you surround yourself with an aura of magical wind and lightning that extends 10 feet from you in every direction but not through total cover. The aura lasts until the start of your next turn or until you are incapacitated. While the aura is active, you have resistance to lightning and thunder damage. In addition, attack rolls against you have disadvantage, and whenever another creature starts its turn within the aura, you can force the creature to make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the modifier of the ability increased by this feat). On a failed save, the creature's speed is halved until the start of its next turn. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Chaotic Flare: When you roll a 1 or a 20 on an attack roll or a saving throw, the magic of chaos flows through you. Roll a d4 and consult the Chaotic Flares table to determine what happens. A flare lasts until the end of your next turn, and a new flare can't occur until after the first flare ends.

Chaotic Flares:
d4 | Flare
1 | Battle Fury. A creature of your choice that you can see is filled with reckless fury. It has advantage on attack rolls and disadvantage on ability checks.
2 | Disruption Field. Waves of energy ripple around you. Every creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of you, or that moves into that area for the first time on a turn, takes 1d8 force damage.
3 | Unbound. When you move, you can use some or all of your walking speed to teleport yourself once, along with any equipment you're wearing or carrying, up to the distance used to an unoccupied space that you can see.
4 | Wailing Winds. Winds swirl in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on you. You and any other creatures in that area have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.

Planar Adaptation: When you finish a long rest, you gain resistance to either acid, cold, or fire damage (your choice) until you finish your next long rest.

Portal Cracker: Your experience with portals allows you to open them without a portal key. As an action, you can concentrate on a portal you're aware of that is within 5 feet of yourself and make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a failed check, you take 3d8 psychic damage and can't use this benefit on that portal again until you finish a long rest. On a successful check, you can force the portal open or closed for 1 hour. For that duration, the portal doesn't respond to its portal key unless a creature employing the key succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check as an action.

Portal Sense: You know the direction to the last planar portal you used while you and the portal are on the same plane of existence. Moreover, as an action, you can detect the location of any portals within 30 feet of you that aren't behind total cover. Once you detect a portal with this action, you can't use the action again until you finish a long rest.

    <text>You have mastered the art of on-the-fly invention, improvement, and jury-rigging. You can use your talents to create immediate, short-term magical effects similar to spells, given time and an adequate supply of aether.
	When you choose this feat, you master two magical effects, each of which recreates the effect of a 1st-level spell that has the ritual tag. These spells can come from any class list, but Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for them.
	If you come across a schematic geared toward quicksmithing or study with another quicksmith, you might be able to add another spell to the effects you have mastered. The spell's level can be no higher than half your level (rounded up), and it must have the ritual tag. The process of mastering the spell takes 2 hours per level of the spell, and costs 50 gp per level. The cost represents aether you use as you experiment with the spell effect to master it.

	When you create a device, choose one of the following options:

Clockwork Toy: This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.

Fire Starter: This device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.

Music Box: When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.

	• Spiked trap. The triggering creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 piercing damage.

	• Sonic trap. The trap makes a sound audible out to 300 feet

Starting at 10th level, you can make the following advanced traps.

	• Exploding trap. The triggering creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d6 fire damage and is knocked prone.

	• Poison trap. The triggering creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 poison damage and becomes poisoned until the end of its next turn.

	• Gas trap. The triggering creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated until the end of its next turn.

The saving throw DC for your traps equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

3 | Your priorities have become crystal clear. You can always add your proficiency bonus to saving throws against being charmed.

Drawback:
d3 | Drawback
1 | You have a bad back. Your lifting and carrying capacity is halved.
2 | You have become forgetful. When you roll a 13 on the d20 for an Intelligence check, treat the d20 roll as a 1.
3 | You have poor eyesight, which gives you disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

    <name>Starter Feat: Hunted (HB)</name>
    <text>You are pursued by those who would kill you on sight or drag you to an ill-fated end. Perhaps you are fleeing the consequences of a terrible crime, or your name is on the lips of an underworld kingpin. The constant paranoia grants you a +5 bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score and allows you to instantly awaken whenever a creature moves within 30 feet of you. However, you rarely sleep soundly. Roll a d20 whenever you take a long rest; on a 1, you instead only gain the benefits of a short rest.
	If you are confident that you are permanently freed of your pursuers, such as if you escape to another plane of existence or watch your hunter die, you lose this feat.

    <name>Starter Feat: Impaired Vision (HB)</name>
    <text>Due to injury, illness, or incident of birth, you are unable to see as others can. Instead, you rely on a highly trained sense of hearing, and on aids like white canes to navigate. Your actual condition might range from total blindness to varying types of low vision, which grants you the following traits:

	• You have the blinded condition. However, attack rolls don't have advantage against you due to this condition.

	• You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

	• You can cast spells that require you to see a target or area, provided that the target or part of the area is within 30 feet, you have a direct line of sight to the target or area, and you can hear the target if it is a creature. If the target or area is further than 30 feet from you, you can make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, you cast the spell normally. On a failure, the spell fails and its spell slot is wasted.

	• You are immune to spells and effects, such as a medusa's Petrifying Gaze, that require you to see.

If your visual impairment is ever remedied, such as through the use of a regenerate spell, you lose the benefits of this feat. The GM should discuss with you whether or not removing your impairment is appropriate for your character-it is always a possibility, but never a requirement.

    <name>Starter Feat: Lower Limb Disability (HB)</name>
    <text>Due to injury, illness, or incident of birth, you are unable to walk as others do and must rely on some sort of aid for mobility. The cause might include paralysis, amputation of the leg or foot (congenital or acquired), chronic pain, muscular dystrophy, conditions which affect your respiration or balance, or a host of other factors. Because of this, you possess the following traits:

	• You rely on some sort of aid to stand and move. This can include, but is not limited to, crutches, a wheelchair or similar wheeled contraption, or a mechanical or magical apparatus that helps support your weight. Work with the GM to decide which sort of aid works best in the campaign world.

	• You can't take the Dash action on difficult terrain.

	• You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to knock you prone or move you against your will.

If your mobility disability is ever remedied, such as through the use of a regenerate spell, you lose the benefits of this feat. The GM should discuss with you whether or not removing your disability is appropriate for your character—it is always a possibility, but never a requirement.

<feat>
    <name>Starter Feat: Soul Twin (HB)</name>
    <text>You were born as a pair of soul twins, identical twins that share a single soul and act as an extension of one another. These twins function as a single character with two bodies, which you control.

Actions. Your twins share a single action, bonus action, and reaction between them, each of which can be taken only once by one of the twins on your turn. If you take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Ready, or Search actions, both twins perform the action and gain its benefits.

Attacks. If you take the attack Action to attack with one twin, the other twin can attack as a bonus action. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you're able to make multiple attacks, you can divide these attacks between the twins.

Hit Points. Soul twins have separate hit points, which are divided between them. At 1st level, each twin has the hit points of a character of the same class. At higher levels, each soul twin's hit point maximum increases by your Constitution modifier + half a roll of the class's Hit Die (rounded up). If you use the average value instead of rolling the Hit Die, each twin gains 2 for a do class, 3 for a d8 class, 3 for a d10 class, 4 for a d12 class.
	When you spend Hit Dice following a short rest, you must spend the dice separately on each twin.

Spellcasting. A pair of soul twins can only concentrate on one spell at a time. However, only one of the twins needs to concentrate on a spell to maintain it. When you cast a spell which requires concentration, you choose which twin is concentrating on it.
	When casting a spell, either twin can provide the spell components, and the spell can originate from the twin of your choice.

Magical Effects. If a spell or magical ability affects one soul twin, it affects them both, unless that spell or ability affects hit points, or if the two twins are further than 100 feet apart. In either case, it affects each twin separately.

Conditions. A condition, such as being poisoned or grappled, affects only one twin, even if imposed by a spell.

Death. When a soul twin is reduced to 0 hit points and begins to make death saving throws, the other twin becomes incapacitated and its speed is halved. If a soul twin dies, the other twin quickly begins to deteriorate, and perishes 24 hours later if their partner doesn't return to life.

Empathic Link. As long as both twins are on the same plane, they can empathetically sense the other's emotional state. Each twin knows when the other takes damage.

Soul Twins:
The Soul Twins feat is an advanced option that shouldn't be taken by new players or those that routinely control other creatures, such as captains and necromancers. If it is unclear how a spell or effect would affect the soul twins, the GM adjudicates the outcome. A good rule of thumb is that if it heals, harms, or grabs a twin, it affects only one; if it charms, curses, enchants, or protects a twin, it affects both.

Perhaps your true home merely lies on the other side of the vast ocean. Regardless, you know very little of this land, its history, or its people, and they also know very little of you. This results in the following traits:

	• You have disadvantage on Intelligence (History) checks pertaining to this new land's history or customs.

Regardless, you now walk the mortal realm with the following traits:

	• You do not need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe. You must still spend 8 hours doing light activity, such as keeping watch in order to gain the benefits of a long rest.

	• You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the poisoned condition on yourself, and you have resistance against poison damage.

	• Though your type is Humanoid, spells and effects which specifically affect Undead affect you as well.

    <name>Starter Feat: Upper Limb Disability (HB)</name>
    <text>Due to injury, illness, or incident of birth, you are unable to use your arms as others can. The cause might include partial paralysis, amputation of the arm or hand (congenital or acquired), lack of manual dexterity, arthritis, chronic pain, or a host of other factors.
	Even if you are missing an arm or hand, you can still engage in two-weapon fighting or wield a sword and shield at the same time through the use of prosthetics or a mechanical or magical apparatus that helps you grasp and hold objects.
	The nature of your limb disability might vary, so you gain one of the following traits of your choice, as appropriate to your disability:

	• You have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons and Strength checks that require use of your hands.

	• You have disadvantage on attack rolls with finesse and ranged weapons, and Dexterity checks that require use of your hands.

However, your learned resourcefulness knows no bounds. You have advantage on weapon attacks you prepare with the Ready action.
	If your limb disability is ever remedied, such as through the use of a regenerate spell, you lose the benefits of this feat. The GM should discuss with you whether or not removing your disability is appropriate for your character—it is always a possibility, but never a requirement.

	• When you can see or hear a creature within the reach of a melee weapon you are wielding cast a spell, you can make an opportunity attack against it. On hit, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw as if it were doing so to maintain concentration. On a failure, its spell fails to take effect, and its slot or use of that ability is wasted.

	• If you damage a creature concentrating on a spell, it has disadvantage on its Constitution saving throw to maintain its concentration. This does not stack with the first bullet.

	• You have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by creatures you can see or hear within 5 feet of you.

    <text>You master the handaxe, battleaxe, greataxe, warhammer, and maul. You gain the following benefits when using any of them:

	• You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with the weapon.

	• Whenever you have advantage on a melee attack roll you make with the weapon and hit, you can knock the target prone if the lower of the two d20 rolls would also hit the target.

	• Whenever you have disadvantage on a melee attack roll you make with the weapon, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of 0) if the attack misses but the higher of the two d20 rolls would have hit.

	• If you use the Help action to aid an ally's melee attack while you're wielding the weapon, you knock the target's shield aside momentarily. In addition to the ally gaining advantage on the attack roll, the ally gains a +2 bonus to the roll if the target is using a shield.

	• When you hit with an opportunity attack using a flail, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.

	• During a long rest, you can prepare and serve a meal that helps you and your allies recover from the rigors of adventuring, provided you have suitable food, cook's utensils, and other supplies on hand. The meal serves up to six people, and each person who eats it regains two additional Hit Dice at the end of the long rest. In addition, those who partake of the meal have advantage on Constitution saving throws against disease for the next 24 hours.

    <name>Spear Mastery (UA)</name>
    <text>Though the spear is a simple weapon to learn, it rewards you for the time you have taken to master it. You gain the following benefits:

	• You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with a spear.

	• When you use a spear, its damage die changes from a d6 to a d8, and from a d8 to a d10 when wielded with two hands. (This benefit has no effect if another feature has already improved the weapon's die.)

	• You can set your spear to receive a charge. As a bonus action, choose a creature you can see that is at least 20 feet away from you. If that creature moves within your spear's reach on its next turn, you can make a melee attack against it with your spear as a reaction. If the attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 piercing damage, or an extra 1d10 piercing damage if you wield the spear with two hands. You can't use this ability if the creature used the Disengage action before moving.

	• As a bonus action on your turn, you can increase your reach with a spear by 5 feet for the rest of your turn.

    <text>This feat is presented as an illustrative example of a poorly-designed feat, and is not intended to be used in play. The Fell Handed feat is presented as a well-designed implementation of the same ideas, and should be used instead.

When you hit a creature with a warhammer, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.
	In addition, you can use your warhammer to knock away a foe's shield. If you hit a creature that's using a shield, you can have the attack deal no damage and force the creature to drop its shield.

    <name>Wild Talent (UA) (Charisma)</name>
    <text>You awaken to your psionic potential, which enhances your mind or body. Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20, to represent this enhancement.
	You also harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, an energy that ebbs and flows as you channel it in various ways. This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die, the starting size of which is a d6.
	You can use your Psionic Talent die in the following ways:

	• Psi-Boosted Ability: When you make an ability check with the ability increased by this feat, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the check. You can choose to do so before or after rolling the d20, but before you know whether the check succeeded or failed.

	• Psi-Guided Strike: Once on each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll that uses the ability increased by this feat, you can roll your Psionic Talent die after you make the damage roll and then replace one of the damage dice with the number rolled on the Psionic Talent die.

Changing the Die's Size:
If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example, if the die is a d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes a d4. If it's a d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest.

Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you roll a 1 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6.

Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size. When you reach certain levels, the starting size of your Psionic Talent die increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

If you have a Psionic Talent die from another source, such as a class feature, you don't get more than one die; use only the one with the largest starting size.

Psi Replenishment:
As a bonus action, you can calm your mind for a moment and restore your Psionic Talent die to its starting size. You then can't use Psi Replenishment again until you finish a long rest.

This bonus applies to one creature of your choice that you can see damaged by the spell; you can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

Card Tricks. You learn the prestidigitation cantrip and can use it to create illusions that duplicate the effects of stage magic. When you use prestidigitation in this way, you can conceal the verbal and somatic components of the spell as mundane conversation and card-handling.

Hidden Ace. When you finish a long rest, you can choose one spell you know and imbue it into a card; the chosen spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and its level must be less than or equal to your proficiency bonus. While the card is imbued with the spell, you can use your bonus action to flourish the card and cast the spell within. The card then immediately loses its magic.
