      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Proud Dragon Kin</name>
      <text>Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are smiting, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.
	The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor-bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic like gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Self-Sufficient Clans</name>
      <text>To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn's conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.
	A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency, of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of that particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.
	Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a client needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races or even from the gods.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Dragonborn Names</name>
      <text>Dragonborn have personal names given at birth, but they put their clan names first as a mark of honor. A childhood name or nickname is often used among clutch mates as a descriptive term or endearment. The name might recall an event or center on a habit.

Male Names: Arjhan, Balasar, Bharash, Donaar, Ghesh, Hesken, Kriv, Medrash, Mehen, Nadarr, Pandjed, Patrin, Rhogar, Shamash, Shedinn, Tarhun, Torinn

Female Names: Akra, Biri, Daar, Farideh, Harann, Havilar, Jheri, Kava, Korinn, Mishann, Nala, Perra, Raiann, Sora, Surina, Thava, Uadjit

      <name>Age</name>
      <text>Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Dragonborn tend towards extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between Good and Evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). More side with Bahamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers are mostly kobolds), but villainous dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed. Some rare few choose to devote themselves to lesser dragon deities, such as Chronepsis (Neutral), and fewer still choose to worship Io, the Ninefold Dragon, who is all alignments at once.</text>

      <name>Size</name>
      <text>Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

To set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size modifier:

Size modifier = 2d8

      <name>Breath Weapon</name>
      <text>You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.
	When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.
	After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</text>

As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerun in their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in the Dragonlance setting.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Short and Stout</name>
      <text>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.
	Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth.
	Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Long Memory, Long Grudges</name>
      <text>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.
	Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.
	Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Clans and Kingdoms</name>
      <text>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can't find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.
	The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors' names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.
	Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Gods, Gold, and Clan</name>
      <text>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure-for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan's lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Slow to Trust</name>
      <text>Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. "The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years," is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf's trust.

Elves: "It's not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc's head, they're as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. They're flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, though: They don't have many smiths, but the ones they have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come streaming down out of the mountains, an elf's good to have at your back. Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do."

Halflings: "Sure, they're pleasant folk. But show me a halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a treasure for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing. How can you take them seriously?"

Humans: "You take the time to get to know a human, and by then the human's on her deathbed. If you're lucky, she's got kin-a daughter or granddaughter, maybe-who's got hands and heart as good as hers. That's when you can make a human friend. And watch them go!. They set their hearts on something, they'll get it whether it's a dragon's hoard or an empire's throne. You have to admire that kind of dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more often than not."</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.

Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following lhe goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have build their own civilizalion in the deplhs of the Underdark, patterned afler the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin thal resemb[es polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.
	As a drow, you are infused with the magic of the Underdark, an underground realm of wonders and horrors rarely seen on the surface above. You are at home in shadows and, thanks to your innate magic, learn to conjure forth both light and darkness. Your kin tend to have stark white hair and grayish skin of many hues.
	The cult of the god Lolth, Queen of Spiders, has corrupted some of the oldest drow cities, especially in the worlds of Oerth and Toril. Eberron, Krynn, and other realms have escaped the cult's influence—for now. Wherever the cult lurks, drow heroes stand on the front lines in the war against it, seeking to sunder Lolth's web.

      <name>Slender and Graceful</name>
      <text>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.
	Elves' coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</text>

      <name>A Timeless Perspective</name>
      <text>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.
	Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</text>

In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.

      <text>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.

As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&amp;D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.
	The sun elves of Faerûn (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.

As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerûn, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.
	Wood elves' skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.

      <text>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed.</text>

      <text>A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.

As a forest gnome, you have a natural knack for illusion and inherent quickness and stealth. In the worlds of D&amp;D, forest gnomes are rare and secretive. They gather in hidden communities in sylvan forests, using illusions and trickery to conceal themselves from threats or to mask their escape should they be detected. Forest gnomes tend to be friendly with other good-spirited woodland folk, and they regard elves and good fey as their most important allies. These gnomes also befriend small forest animals and rely on them for information about threats that might prowl their lands.

Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races.

	Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars, though, mark an Orc, or half-orc as a former slave or a disgraced exile.

      <text>The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the Orcs, and even those orcs who turn away from his worship can't fully escape his influence. The same is true of half orcs, though their human blood moderates the impact of their orcish heritage. Some half-orcs hear the whispers of Grummsh in their dreams, calling them to unleash the rage that simmers within them. Others feel Gruumsh's exultation when they join in melee combat-and either exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing. Half-orcs are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within them, whether they embrace it or rebel against it.
	Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully. Rage doesn't just quicken their pulse, it makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures-feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing-fill their hearts with joy. They tend to be short tempered and sometimes sullen, more inclined to action than contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most accomplished half-orcs are those with enough self control to get by in a civilized land.</text>

Female Orc Names: Baggi, Emen, Engong, Kansif, Myev, Neega, Ovak, Ownka, Shautha, Vola, Volen, Yevelda</text>

      <text>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along a dirt road or a raft floating downriver.
	Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.

As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You're inclined to be affable and get along well with others. In the Forgotten Realms, lightfoot halflings have spread the farthest and thus are the most common variety.
	Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life. In the world of Greyhawk, these halflings are called hairfeet or tallfellows.

	Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They're concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation.

      <text>In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that's why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>A Broad Spectrum</name>
      <text>With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Variety in All Things</name>
      <text>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human's memory. They live fully in the present-making them well suited to the adventuring life-but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Lasting Institutions</name>
      <text>Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death's clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone.
	Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of humans who live in nonhuman lands.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Exemplars of Ambition</name>
      <text>Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Human Names and Ethnicities</name>
      <text>Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly), but most parents give names that are linked to their region's culture or to the naming traditions of their ancestors.
	The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region. In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in the northwestern lands of the Silver Marches than in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east-and even more distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Silver Marches have every possible variation of coloration and features.
	In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are found in more localized areas of Faerun. These groups, and the typical names of their members, can be used as inspiration no matter which world your human is in.

Calishite:
Shorter and slighter in build than most other humans, Calishites have dusky brown skin, hair, and eyes.
	They're found primarily in southwest Faerun.

Calishite Names: (Male) Aseir, Bardeid, Haseid, Khemed, Mehmen, Sudeiman, Zasheir; (female) Atala, Ceidil, Hama, Jasmal, Meilil, Seipora, Yasheira, Zasheida; (surnames) Basha, Dumein, Jassan, Khalid, Mostana, Pashar, Rein

Chondathan:
Chondathans are slender, tawny-skinned folk with brown hair that ranges from almost blond to almost black. Most are tall and have green or brown eyes, but these traits are hardly universal. Humans of Chondathan descent dominate the central lands of Faerun, around the Inner Sea.

Chondathan Names: (Male) Darvin, Dorn, Evendur, Gorstag, Grim, Helm, Malark, Morn, Randal, Stedd; (female) Arveene, Esvele, Chessail, Kerri, Lureene, Miri, Rowan, Shandri, Tessele; (surnames) Amblecrown, Buckman, Dundragon, Evenwood, Greycastle, Tallstag

Damaran:
Found primarily in the northwest of Faerun, Damarans are of moderate height and build, with skin hues ranging from tawny to fair. Their hair is usually brown or black, and their eye color varies widely, though brown is most common.

Damaran Names: (Male) Bor, Fodel, Glar, Grigor, Igan, Ivor, Kosef, Mival, Orel, Pavel, Sergor; (female) Alethra, Kara, Katernin, Mara, Natali, Olma, Tana, Zora; (surnames) Bersk, Chernin, Dotsk, Kulenov, Marsk, Nemetsk, Shemov, Starag

Illuskan:
Illuskans are tall, fair-skinned folk with blue or steely gray eyes. Most have raven-black hair, but those who inhabit the extreme northwest have blond, red, or light brown hair.

Illuskan Names: (Male) Ander, Blath, Bran, Frath, Geth, Lander, Luth, Malcer, Stor, Taman, Urth; (female) Amafrey, Betha, Cefrey, Kethra, Mara, Olga, Silifrey, Westra; (surnames) Brightwood, Helder, Hornraven, Lackman, Stormwind, Windrivver

Mulan:
Dominant in the eastern and southeastern shores of the Inner Sea, the Mulan are generally tall, slim, and amber-skinned, with eyes of hazel or brown. Their hair ranges from black to dark brown, but in the lands where the Mulan are most prominent, nobles and many other Mulan shave off all their hair.

Mulan Names: (Male) Aoth, Bareris, Ehput-Ki, Kethoth, Mumed, Ramas, So-Kehur, Thazar-De, Urhur; (female) Arizima, Chathi, Nephis, Nulara, Murithi, Sefris, Thola, Umara, Zolis; (surnames) Ankhalab, Anskuld, Fezim, Hahpet, Nathandem, Sepret, Uuthrakt

Rashemi:
Most often found east of the Inner Sea and often intermingled with the Mulan, Rashemis tend to be short, stout, and muscular. They usually have dusky skin, dark eyes, and thick black hair.

Rashemi Names: (Male) Borivik, Faurgar, Jandar, Kanithar, Madislak, Ralmevik, Shaumar, Vladislak; (female) Fyevarra, Hulmarra, Immith, Imzel, Navarra, Shevarra, Tammith, Yuldra; (surnames) Chergoba, Dyernina, Iltazyara, Murnyethara, Stayanoga, Ulmokina

Shou:
The Shou are the most numerous and powerful ethnic group in Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerun. They are yellowish-bronze in hue, with black hair and dark eyes. Shou surnames are usually presented before the given name.

Shou Names: (Male) An, Chen, Chi, Fai, Jiang, Jun, Lian, Long, Meng, On, Shan, Shui, Wen; (female) Bai, Chao, Lia, Lei, Mei, Qiao, Shui, Tai; (surnames) Chien, Huang, Kao, Kung, Lao, Ling, Mei, Pin, Shin, Sum, Tan, Wan

Tethyrian:
Widespread along the entire Sword Coast at the western edge of Faerun, Tethyrians are of medium build and height, with dusky skin that tends to grow fairer the farther north they dwell. Their hair and eye color varies widely, but brown hair and blue eyes are the most common. Tethyrians primarily use Chondathan names.

Turami:
Native to the southern shore of the Inner Sea, the Turami people are generally tall and muscular, with dark mahogany skin, curly black hair, and dark eyes.

Turami Names: (Male) Anton, Diero, Marcon, Pieron, Rimardo, Romero, Salazar, Umbero; (female) Balama, Dona, Faila, Jalana, Luisa, Marta, Quara, Selise, Vonda; (surnames) Agosto, Astorio, Calabra, Domine, Falone, Marivaldi, Pisacar, Ramondo</text>

Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that's why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>A Broad Spectrum</name>
      <text>With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Variety in All Things</name>
      <text>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human's memory. They live fully in the present-making them well suited to the adventuring life-but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Lasting Institutions</name>
      <text>Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death's clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone.
	Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of humans who live in nonhuman lands.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Exemplars of Ambition</name>
      <text>Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Human Names and Ethnicities</name>
      <text>Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly), but most parents give names that are linked to their region's culture or to the naming traditions of their ancestors.
	The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region. In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in the northwestern lands of the Silver Marches than in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east-and even more distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Silver Marches have every possible variation of coloration and features.
	In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are found in more localized areas of Faerun. These groups, and the typical names of their members, can be used as inspiration no matter which world your human is in.

Calishite:
Shorter and slighter in build than most other humans, Calishites have dusky brown skin, hair, and eyes.
	They're found primarily in southwest Faerun.

Calishite Names: (Male) Aseir, Bardeid, Haseid, Khemed, Mehmen, Sudeiman, Zasheir; (female) Atala, Ceidil, Hama, Jasmal, Meilil, Seipora, Yasheira, Zasheida; (surnames) Basha, Dumein, Jassan, Khalid, Mostana, Pashar, Rein

Chondathan:
Chondathans are slender, tawny-skinned folk with brown hair that ranges from almost blond to almost black. Most are tall and have green or brown eyes, but these traits are hardly universal. Humans of Chondathan descent dominate the central lands of Faerun, around the Inner Sea.

Chondathan Names: (Male) Darvin, Dorn, Evendur, Gorstag, Grim, Helm, Malark, Morn, Randal, Stedd; (female) Arveene, Esvele, Chessail, Kerri, Lureene, Miri, Rowan, Shandri, Tessele; (surnames) Amblecrown, Buckman, Dundragon, Evenwood, Greycastle, Tallstag

Damaran:
Found primarily in the northwest of Faerun, Damarans are of moderate height and build, with skin hues ranging from tawny to fair. Their hair is usually brown or black, and their eye color varies widely, though brown is most common.

Damaran Names: (Male) Bor, Fodel, Glar, Grigor, Igan, Ivor, Kosef, Mival, Orel, Pavel, Sergor; (female) Alethra, Kara, Katernin, Mara, Natali, Olma, Tana, Zora; (surnames) Bersk, Chernin, Dotsk, Kulenov, Marsk, Nemetsk, Shemov, Starag

Illuskan:
Illuskans are tall, fair-skinned folk with blue or steely gray eyes. Most have raven-black hair, but those who inhabit the extreme northwest have blond, red, or light brown hair.

Illuskan Names: (Male) Ander, Blath, Bran, Frath, Geth, Lander, Luth, Malcer, Stor, Taman, Urth; (female) Amafrey, Betha, Cefrey, Kethra, Mara, Olga, Silifrey, Westra; (surnames) Brightwood, Helder, Hornraven, Lackman, Stormwind, Windrivver

Mulan:
Dominant in the eastern and southeastern shores of the Inner Sea, the Mulan are generally tall, slim, and amber-skinned, with eyes of hazel or brown. Their hair ranges from black to dark brown, but in the lands where the Mulan are most prominent, nobles and many other Mulan shave off all their hair.

Mulan Names: (Male) Aoth, Bareris, Ehput-Ki, Kethoth, Mumed, Ramas, So-Kehur, Thazar-De, Urhur; (female) Arizima, Chathi, Nephis, Nulara, Murithi, Sefris, Thola, Umara, Zolis; (surnames) Ankhalab, Anskuld, Fezim, Hahpet, Nathandem, Sepret, Uuthrakt

Rashemi:
Most often found east of the Inner Sea and often intermingled with the Mulan, Rashemis tend to be short, stout, and muscular. They usually have dusky skin, dark eyes, and thick black hair.

Rashemi Names: (Male) Borivik, Faurgar, Jandar, Kanithar, Madislak, Ralmevik, Shaumar, Vladislak; (female) Fyevarra, Hulmarra, Immith, Imzel, Navarra, Shevarra, Tammith, Yuldra; (surnames) Chergoba, Dyernina, Iltazyara, Murnyethara, Stayanoga, Ulmokina

Shou:
The Shou are the most numerous and powerful ethnic group in Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerun. They are yellowish-bronze in hue, with black hair and dark eyes. Shou surnames are usually presented before the given name.

Shou Names: (Male) An, Chen, Chi, Fai, Jiang, Jun, Lian, Long, Meng, On, Shan, Shui, Wen; (female) Bai, Chao, Lia, Lei, Mei, Qiao, Shui, Tai; (surnames) Chien, Huang, Kao, Kung, Lao, Ling, Mei, Pin, Shin, Sum, Tan, Wan

Tethyrian:
Widespread along the entire Sword Coast at the western edge of Faerun, Tethyrians are of medium build and height, with dusky skin that tends to grow fairer the farther north they dwell. Their hair and eye color varies widely, but brown hair and blue eyes are the most common. Tethyrians primarily use Chondathan names.

Turami:
Native to the southern shore of the Inner Sea, the Turami people are generally tall and muscular, with dark mahogany skin, curly black hair, and dark eyes.

Turami Names: (Male) Anton, Diero, Marcon, Pieron, Rimardo, Romero, Salazar, Umbero; (female) Balama, Dona, Faila, Jalana, Luisa, Marta, Quara, Selise, Vonda; (surnames) Agosto, Astorio, Calabra, Domine, Falone, Marivaldi, Pisacar, Ramondo</text>

      <text>To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus, overlord of the Nine Hells (and many of the other powerful devils serving under him) into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children's children will always be held accountable.

    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Infernal Bloodline</name>
      <text>Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look human. However, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes - some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle's, and some spiral upward like an antelopes' horns. They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors black, red, white, silver, or gold with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Self-Reliant and Suspicious</name>
      <text>Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.
	Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling's companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, a tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a friend or ally for life.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Tiefling Names</name>
      <text>Tiefling names fall into three broad categories. Tieflings born into another culture typically have names reflective of that culture. Some have names derived from the infernal language passed down through generations, and reflect their fiendish heritage. And some younger tieflings striving to find a place in the world, adopt a name that signifies a virtue or other concept and then try to embody that concept. For some, the chosen name is a quest. For others, its a grim destiny.

Male Infernal Names: Akmenos, Amnon, Harahas, Ekernon, Tados, Kairon, Leucis, Melech, Morthos, Pelaios, Skamos, Therai

Female Infernal Names: Akra, Anakis, Bryseis, Criella, Ea, Kallista, Lerissa, Makaria, Nemeia, Phelaia, Rieta

Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.

Creatures of magic with strong ties to nature, eladrin live in the twilight realm of the Feywild. Their cities sometimes cross over into the Material Plane, appearing briefly in mountain valleys or deep forest glades before fading back into the Feywild.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Slender and Graceful</name>
      <text>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.

Elves' coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>A Timeless Perspective</name>
      <text>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.

Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Hidden Woodland Realms</name>
      <text>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).

Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Exploration and Adventure</name>
      <text>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</text>

      <text>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.

On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf's adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.

Child Names: Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil. Lael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai, Syllin, Thia, Vall

Male Adult Names: Adran, Aelar, Aramil, Arannis, Aust, Beiro, Berrian, Carric, Enialis, Erdan, Erevan, Galinndan, Hadarai, Heian, Himo, Immeral, Ivellios, Laucian, Mindartis, Paelias, Peren, Quarion, Riardon, Rolen, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol, Theren, Varis

Female Adult Names: Adrie, Althaea, Anastrianna, Andraste, Antinua, Bethrynna, Birel, Caelynn, Drusilia, Enna, Felosial, Ielenia, Jelenneth, Keyleth, Leshanna, Lia, Meriele, Mialee, Naivara, Quelenna, Quillathe, Sariel, Shanairra, Shava, Silaqui, Theirastra, Thia, Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia

Family Names (Common Translations): Amakiir (Gemflower), Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel (Moonwhisper), Holimion (Diamonddew), Ilphelkiir (Gemblossom), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Nai'lo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel (Moonbrook), Xiloscient (Goldpetal)</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Age</name>
      <text>Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.</text>

      <name>Trance</name>
      <text>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
	If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.

Forest gnomes and rock gnomes are the gnomes most commonly encountered in the lands of the surface world. There is another subrace of gnomes rarely seen by any surface-dweller: deep gnomes, also known as svirfneblin. Guarded, and suspicious of outsiders, svirfneblin are cunning and taciturn, but can be just as kind-hearted, loyal, and compassionate as their surface cousins.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Vibrant Expression</name>
      <text>A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome's insatiable interest in everything around.
	A gnome's personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome's beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome's clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Delighted Dedication</name>
      <text>As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but gnomes seem to worry that even with all that time, they can't get in enough of the things they want to do and see.
	Gnomes speak as if they can't get the thoughts out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they manage to listen carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way.
	Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they're just as dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkerers, and inventors. They're willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Bright Burrows</name>
      <text>Gnomes makes their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface where ever they can. Their homes are well hidden by both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those who are not welcome are unlikely to find the burrows in the first place.
	Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkerers. Some human families retained gnome tutors, ensuring that their pupils enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment. A gnome might tutor several generations of a single human family over the course of his or her long life.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Gnome Names</name>
      <text>Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so. A gnome's mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles each give the gnome a name, and various nicknames from just about everyone else might or might not stick over time. Gnome names are typically variants on the names of ancestors or distant relatives, though some are truly new inventions. When dealing with humans and others who are "Stuffy" about names, a gnome learns to use no more than three names; A personal name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing the one in each category that's the most fun to say.

Male Names: Alston, Alvyn, Boddynock, Brocc, Ettrgell, Dimble, Eldon, Erky, Fonkin, Frug, Gerbo, Gimble, Glim, Jebeddo, Kellen, Namfoodle. Orryn, Roondar, Seebo, Warryn, Wrenn, Zook

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Seeing The World</name>
      <text>Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love of exploring. As lovers of gems and other fine items, some gnomes take to adventuring as s quick, if dangerous, path to wealth. Regardless of what spurs them to adventure, gnomes who adopt this way of life eke as much enjoyment out of it as they do out of any other activity they undertake, sometimes to the great annoyance of their adventuring companions.</text>

      <text>Lizardfolk possess an alien and inscrutable mindset, their desires and thoughts driven by a different set of basic principles than those of warm-blooded creatures. Their dismal swamp homes might lie hundreds of miles from the nearest human settlement, but the gap between their way of thinking and that of the smooth-skins is far greater.

Lizardfolk Personality:
d8 | Quirk
1 | You hate waste and see no reason not to scavenge fallen enemies. Fingers are tasty and portable!
2 | You sleep best while mostly submerged in water.
3 | Money is meaningless to you.
4 | You think there are only two species of humanoid: lizardfolk and meat.
5 | You have learned to laugh. You use this talent in response to all emotional situations, to better fit in with your comrades.
6 | You still don't understand how metaphors work. That doesn't stop you from using them at every opportunity.
7 | You appreciate the soft humanoids who realize they need chain mail and swords to match the gifts you were born with.
8 | You enjoy eating your food while it's still wriggling.</text>

      <text>Merfolk are an amphibious race, born and at home in the water but comfortable on dry land. Humanoid in form, they have skin of ivory, silver, russet, blue, or deep purple. Long fins extend from the backs of their forearms and calves, and their fingers and toes are webbed. The hairlike growths on their heads are either thick and bristly like the needles of a sea urchin, or long and wavy, resembling fine seaweed. In either case, these growths typically range in color from red to warm brown to black. Male merfolk have similar growths extending down from their cheekbones.

      <text>To feel the thunder of orcish war drums outside the gate and to hear a chorus of voices growling, "Gruumsh!" is the nightmare of every civilized place in the world. For no matter how thick its walls, skilled its archers, or brave its knights, few settlements have ever withstood a full-scale onslaught of orcs.
	Every soldier who lives through a fight with orcs tells of confronting a hulking foe that can cleave through a warrior with a single blow, part of a force that can cut down enemies as though they were trembling stalks of wheat before the scythe. Only a skilled and determined hero can hope to survive single combat with an orc.
	Savage and fearless, orc tribes are ever in search of elves, dwarves, and humans to destroy. Motivated by their hatred of the civilized races of the world and their need to satisfy the demands of their deities, the orcs know that if they fight well and bring glory to their tribe, Gruumsh will call them home to the plane of Acheron. It is there in the afterlife where the chosen ones will join Gruumsh and his armies in their endless extraplanar battle for supremacy.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Those who think of other planes at all consider them remote, distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.
	The Elemental Planes are often inhospitable to natives of the Material Plane: crushing earth, searing flames, boundless skies, and endless seas make visiting these places dangerous for even a short time.
	The powerful genies, however, don't face such troubles when venturing into the mortal world. They adapt well to the mingled elements of the Material Plane, and they sometimes visit—whether of their own volition or compelled by magic. Some genies can adopt mortal guise and travel incognito.
During these visits, a mortal might catch a genie's eye. Friendship forms, romance blooms, and sometimes children result. These children are genasi: individuals with ties to two worlds, yet belonging to neither. Some genasi are born of mortal—genie unions, others have two genasi as parents, and a rare few have a genie further up their family tree, manifesting an elemental heritage that's lain dormant for generations.
	Occasionally, genasi result from exposure to a surge of elemental power, through phenomena such as an eruption from the Inner Planes or a planar convergence.
	Elemental energy saturates any creatures in the area and might alter their nature enough that their offspring with other mortals are born as genasi.

As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.
	Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh or grow crystals from their scalps.

      <name>Heirs to Elemental Power</name>
      <text>Genasi inherit something from both sides of their dual nature. They resemble humans but have unusual skin color (red, green, blue, or gray), and there is something odd about them. The elemental blood flowing through their veins manifests differently in each genasi, often as magical power.
	Seen in silhouette, a genasi can usually pass for human. Those of earth or water descent tend to be heavier, while those of air or fire tend to be lighter. A given genasi might have some features reminiscent of the mortal parent (pointed ears from an elf, a stockier frame and thick hair from a dwarf, small hands and feet from a halfling, exceedingly large eyes from a gnome, and so on).
	Genasi almost never have contact with their elemental parents. Genies seldom have interest in their mortal offspring, seeing them as accidents. Many feel nothing for their genasi children at all.
	Some genasi live as outcasts, driven into exile for their unsettling appearance and strange magic, or assuming leadership of savage humanoids and weird cults in untamed lands. Others gain positions of great influence, especially where elemental beings are revered. A few genasi leave the Material Plane to find refuge in the households of their genie parents.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Wild and Confident</name>
      <text>Genasi rarely lack confidence, seeing themselves as equal to almost any challenge in their path. This certainty might manifest as graceful self-assurance in one genasi and as arrogance in another. Such selfconfidence can sometimes blind genasi to risk, and their great plans often get them and others into trouble.
	Too much failure can chip away at even a genasi's sense of self, so they constantly push themselves to improve, honing their talents and perfecting their craft.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Genasi Lands</name>
      <text>As rare beings, genasi might go their entire lives without encountering another one of their kind. There are no great genasi cities or empires. Genasi seldom have communities of their own and typically adopt the cultures and societies into which they are born. The more strange their appearance, the harder time they have. Many genasi lose themselves in teeming cities, where their distinctiveness hardly raises an eyebrow in places accustomed to a variety of different people.
	Those living on the frontier, though, have a much harder time. People there tend to be less accepting of differences. Sometimes a cold shoulder and a suspicious glare are the best genasi can hope for; in more backward places, they face ostracism and even violence from people who mistake them for fiends.
	Facing a hard life, these genasi seek isolation in the wilds, making their homes in mountains or forests, near lakes, or underground.
	Most air and fire genasi in the Realms are descendants of the djinn and efreet who once ruled Calimshan. When those rulers were overthrown, their planetouched children were scattered. Over thousands of years, the bloodlines of those genasi have spread into other lands. Though far from common, air and fire genasi are more likely to be found in the western regions of Faerûn, along the coast from Calimshan north up to the Sword Coast, and into the Western Heartlands to the east. Some remain in their ancient homeland.
	In contrast, water and earth genasi have no common history. Individuals have difficulty tracing their own lineage, and bloodlines occasionally skip a generation or two. Many earth genasi originated in the North and spread out from there. Water genasi come from coastal areas, the largest concentration of them hailing from the regions surrounding the Sea of Fallen Stars.
	The distant land of Zakhara is known only in legends to most inhabitants of Faerûn. There, genies and spellcasters enter into bargains, and genasi can result from such pacts. Those genasi have been sources of great weal and woe in the history of that land.</text>

You tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action.
	Elemental earth manifests differently from one individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates. Earth genasi can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals. The most arresting have fissures in their flesh, from which faint light shines.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Those who think of other planes at all consider them remote, distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.
	The Elemental Planes are often inhospitable to natives of the Material Plane: crushing earth, searing flames, boundless skies, and endless seas make visiting these places dangerous for even a short time.
	The powerful genies, however, don't face such troubles when venturing into the mortal world. They adapt well to the mingled elements of the Material Plane, and they sometimes visit—whether of their own volition or compelled by magic. Some genies can adopt mortal guise and travel incognito.
During these visits, a mortal might catch a genie's eye. Friendship forms, romance blooms, and sometimes children result. These children are genasi: individuals with ties to two worlds, yet belonging to neither. Some genasi are born of mortal—genie unions, others have two genasi as parents, and a rare few have a genie further up their family tree, manifesting an elemental heritage that's lain dormant for generations.
	Occasionally, genasi result from exposure to a surge of elemental power, through phenomena such as an eruption from the Inner Planes or a planar convergence.
	Elemental energy saturates any creatures in the area and might alter their nature enough that their offspring with other mortals are born as genasi.

As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it.
	Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal- black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices might sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.

      <name>Heirs to Elemental Power</name>
      <text>Genasi inherit something from both sides of their dual nature. They resemble humans but have unusual skin color (red, green, blue, or gray), and there is something odd about them. The elemental blood flowing through their veins manifests differently in each genasi, often as magical power.
	Seen in silhouette, a genasi can usually pass for human. Those of earth or water descent tend to be heavier, while those of air or fire tend to be lighter. A given genasi might have some features reminiscent of the mortal parent (pointed ears from an elf, a stockier frame and thick hair from a dwarf, small hands and feet from a halfling, exceedingly large eyes from a gnome, and so on).
	Genasi almost never have contact with their elemental parents. Genies seldom have interest in their mortal offspring, seeing them as accidents. Many feel nothing for their genasi children at all.
	Some genasi live as outcasts, driven into exile for their unsettling appearance and strange magic, or assuming leadership of savage humanoids and weird cults in untamed lands. Others gain positions of great influence, especially where elemental beings are revered. A few genasi leave the Material Plane to find refuge in the households of their genie parents.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Wild and Confident</name>
      <text>Genasi rarely lack confidence, seeing themselves as equal to almost any challenge in their path. This certainty might manifest as graceful self-assurance in one genasi and as arrogance in another. Such selfconfidence can sometimes blind genasi to risk, and their great plans often get them and others into trouble.
	Too much failure can chip away at even a genasi's sense of self, so they constantly push themselves to improve, honing their talents and perfecting their craft.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Genasi Lands</name>
      <text>As rare beings, genasi might go their entire lives without encountering another one of their kind. There are no great genasi cities or empires. Genasi seldom have communities of their own and typically adopt the cultures and societies into which they are born. The more strange their appearance, the harder time they have. Many genasi lose themselves in teeming cities, where their distinctiveness hardly raises an eyebrow in places accustomed to a variety of different people.
	Those living on the frontier, though, have a much harder time. People there tend to be less accepting of differences. Sometimes a cold shoulder and a suspicious glare are the best genasi can hope for; in more backward places, they face ostracism and even violence from people who mistake them for fiends.
	Facing a hard life, these genasi seek isolation in the wilds, making their homes in mountains or forests, near lakes, or underground.

	Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi's hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams.

      <text>Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves.
	Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.

      <text>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies. Others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.

Ghostwise halflings trace their ancestry back to a war among halfling tribes that sent their ancestors into flight from Luiren. Ghostwise halflings are the rarest of the hin, found only in the Chondalwood and a few other isolated forests, clustered in tight-knit clans.
	Many ghostwise clans select a natural landmark as the center of their territory, and members carry a piece of that landmark with them at all times. Clan warriors known as nightgliders bond with and ride giant owls as mounts.
	Because these folk are clannish and mistrustful of outsiders, ghostwise halfling adventurers are rare. Ask your DM if you can play a member of this subrace, which has the halfling traits in the Player's Handbook, plus the subrace traits below.

      <text>To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus, overlord of the Nine Hells (and many of the other powerful devils serving under him) into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children's children will always be held accountable.

Since not all tieflings are of the blood of Asmodeus, some have traits that differ from those in the Player's Handbook. The Dungeon Master may permit the following variants for your tiefling character, although Devil's Tongue, Hellfire, and Winged are mutually exclusive. (Choose only one)

      <text>Aasimar bear within their souls the light of the heavens. They are descended from humans with a touch of the power of Mount Celestia, the divine realm of many lawful good deities. Aasimar are born to serve as champions of the gods, their births hailed as blessed events. They are a people of otherworldly visages, with luminous features that reveal their celestial heritage.

Scourge aasimar are imbued with a divine energy that blazes intensely within them. It feeds a powerful desire to destroy evil-a desire that is, at its best, unflinching and, at its worst, all-consuming. Many scourge aasimar wear masks to block out the world and focus on containing this power, unmasking themselves only in battle.

      <name>Celestial Champions</name>
      <text>Aasimar are placed in the world to serve as guardians of law and good. Their patrons expect them to strike at evil, lead by example, and further the cause of justice.
	From an early age, an aasimar receives visions and guidance from celestial entities via dreams. These dreams help shape an aasimar, granting a sense of destiny and a desire for righteousness.
	Each aasimar can count a specific celestial agent of the gods as a guide. This entity is typically a deva, an angel who acts as a messenger to the mortal world.</text>

      <name>Aasimar Guides</name>
      <text>An aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has a link to an angelic being. That being—usually a deva—provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings.
	The angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it might have insight into combating especially powerful evils that it knows about.
	As part of fleshing out an aasimar character, consider the nature of that character's angelic guide. The Angelic Guide tables offer names and natures that you can use to flesh out your character's guide.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Bugbears feature in the nightmare tales of many races-great, hairy beasts that creep through the shadows as quiet as cats. If you walk alone in the woods, a bugbear will reach out of the bushes and strangle you. If you stray too far from the house at night, bugbears will scoop you up to devour you in their den. If a bugbear cuts off your head, your soul stays trapped inside, and the bugbears use your head to magically command all whom you once knew.
	Lurid tales such as these have flowered from the seeds of truth. Bugbears do rely on stealth and strength to attack, preferring to operate at night. They do take the heads of enemy leaders, but they are no more likely to eat people indiscriminately than humans are. Bugbears aren't likely to attack lone travelers or wandering children unless they clearly have something to gain by doing so. From the viewpoint of the rest of the world, their aggression and savagery are thankfully offset by their rarity and lethargy.

    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Shiftless, Savage Layabouts</name>
      <text>When they're not in battle, bugbears spend much of their time resting or dozing. They don't engage in crafting or agriculture to any great extent, or otherwise produce anything of value. They bully weaker creatures into doing their bidding, so they can take it easy. When a superior force tries to intimidate bugbears into service, they will try to escape rather than perform the work or confront the foe. Even when subsumed into a goblinoid host and drawn into war, bugbears must often be roused from naps and bribed to get them to do their duties.
	This indolence offers no clue to how vicious the creatures are. Bugbears are capable of bouts of incredible ferocity, using their muscular bodies to exact swift and ruthless violence. At their core, bugbears are ambush predators accustomed to long periods of inactivity broken by short bursts of murderous energy. Ferocious though they may be, bugbears aren't built for extended periods of exertion.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Gang Mentality</name>
      <text>Since bugbears aren't a particularly fecund race, their overall population is small and spread over a wide area. Bugbears live in family groups that operate much like gangs. The individuals in a group typically number fewer than a dozen, consisting of siblings and their mates as well as a handful of offspring and an elder or two. A gang lives in and around a small enclosure, often a natural cave or an old bear den, and it might have supplementary dens elsewhere in its territory that it uses temporarily when it goes on long forays for food.
	In good times, a bugbear gang is tight-knit, and its members cooperate well when hunting or bullying other creatures. But when the fortunes of a gang turn sour, the individuals become selfish, and might sabotage one another to remove opposition or exile weaker or unpopular members to keep the rest of the gang strong. Fortunately for the race as a whole, even young and elderly bugbears have the ability to survive alone in the wild, and the cast-off members of a gang might eventually catch on with a different group.
	Left to their own devices, bugbears have little more impact on the world than wolf packs. They subsist by crafting simple tools and hunting and gathering food, and gangs sometimes come together peacefully to exchange members and goods between them.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Malevolent Worship of Malign Gods</name>
      <text>Bugbears worship two deities who are brothers, Hruggek and Grankhul. Hruggek is the fearsome elder sibling, possessed of legendary might and prowess in battle. Bugbears believe their strength and bravery come from him. Cunning Grankhul is the younger one, and in the stories bugbears tell, he gifted them with stealth but in return he sapped their vigor, so that bugbears sleep in his stead while he remains eternally alert and awake.
	According to bugbear legends, Hruggek and Grankhul often fight alongside each other, preying upon all they encounter as is their right as superior warriors. Hruggek takes the heads of those he kills and puts them on spikes in his den, where they utter pleas for mercy and sing paeans to his might. Grankhul watches over Hruggek when he sleeps, but if he must be elsewhere, he whispers commands to the severed heads to wake Hruggek if any danger threatens him.
	Bugbears admire the qualities of both brothers. Because of Hruggek, they consider bravery and physical superiority to be their natural state. Thanks to Grankhul, they can use their size and strength to work as stealthy assassins rather than blundering around like ogres.
	Bullying, murder, and engaging in battle are all holy acts for bugbears. Garroting an unsuspecting creature and defeating foes in open battle are seen as acts of worship, in the same way that dwarves consider metalsmithing to be sacred to Moradin.
The bugbears recognize two other gods, both of which they disdain and fear: Maglubiyet and Skiggaret.
	Maglubiyet, the leader of the goblinoid pantheon, forced both brothers to submit to his rule, but instead of killing them, he showed mercy and even honored them in a way by setting them free — under his control — so that bugbears could continue to employ their talents against his enemies. Bugbears understand that by venerating Hruggek and Grankhul, they also give tribute to Maglubiyet, even though they don't openly pay homage to their overlord. When bugbears are called to join a host, bugbears believe Maglubiyet has again corralled the brothers into a divine battle, and they honor their gods by following suit.
	Skiggaret is the bugbear version of the bogeyman, as hateful and terrifying to them as bugbears are in the eyes of many other races. His name is rarely spoken, and never above a whisper. Skiggaret's influence manifests at times when bugbears are forced to act in a cowardly fashion; a bugbear that knows or feels itself to be in mortal danger is affected by a form of madness and will do anything, including trying to flee, in order to stay alive. Bugbears believe that this feeling of fear comes from being possessed by Skiggaret, and they don't relish experiencing it. After the madness has passed, bugbears don't dwell on things that were done in the presence of Skiggaret. Talking about such acts might call him back.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Blessings of the Bugbear Gods</name>
      <text>Bugbears have no use for priests or shamans. No one needs to tell them what their gods want. If the brother gods are angry with them, they let the bugbears know with bolts of lightning (Hruggek) or by striking them blind or dead (Grankhul). Bugbears worship their gods simply by preying on other creatures, using no other sort of ceremony to show obeisance — with one exception.
	In an act of worship that also sometimes attracts favorable attention from their gods, bugbears sever the heads of defeated foes, cut away or stitch open the eyelids, and leave the mouths hanging open. The heads are then placed on spikes or hung from cords around a bugbear den. The heads themselves are trophies that honor Hruggek, and their ever-staring eyes are an homage to sleepless Grankhul.
	The heads of leaders and mighty opponents are particularly sacred, and offering up such a trophy can provide a bugbear gang with a special boon. A gang that gains the favor of Hruggek and Grankhul in this way might find that the head will emit a shout when an enemy gets too close (in the fashion of an alarm spell). Sometimes the heads of people who have information the bugbears need speak their secrets amid blubbered pleas for mercy (as with the speak with dead spell).</text>

      <text>Firbolgs are fey-oriented half-giants. Their tribes cloister in remote forest strongholds, preferring to spend their days in quiet harmony with the woods. When provoked, firbolgs demonstrate formidable skills with weapons and druidic magic.

      <name>Humble Guardians</name>
      <text>Firbolgs love nothing more than a peaceful day spent among the trees of an old forest. They see forests as sacred places, representing the heart of the world and monuments to the durability of life.
	In their role as caretakers, firbolgs live off the land while striving to remain in balance with nature. Their methods reflect common sense and remarkable resourcefulness. During a bountiful summer, they store away excess nuts, fruit, and berries. When winter arrives, they scatter everything they can spare to ensure the animals of the wood survive until springtime.
	In a firbolg's eyes, there is no greater fault than greed. The firbolgs believe that the world remains healthiest when each creature takes only what it needs. Material goods, especially precious gems and gold, have little appeal to them. What use are such things when winter lingers and food runs short?</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Natural Druids</name>
      <text>Firbolgs have a talent for druidic magic. Their cultural reverence for nature, combined with their strong and insightful minds, makes learning such magic an instinctive part of their development. Almost every firbolg learns a few spells, typically those used to mask their presence, and many go on to master nature magic.
	Firbolgs who become druids serve as stronghold leaders. With every action the tribe takes, the druids weigh not only the group's needs, but the effect each action will have on the forest and the rest of the natural world. Firbolg tribes would rather go hungry than strain the land during a famine.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Hidden Shepherds</name>
      <text>As caretakers of the land, firbolgs prefer to remain out of sight and out of mind. They don't try to dominate nature, but rather seek to ensure that it prospers and survives according to its own laws.
	Firbolgs use their magic to keep their presence in a forest secret. This approach allows them to avoid the politics and struggles of elves, humans, and orcs. Such events concern the firbolgs only when the events affect the forest.
	Even in the face of an intrusion, firbolgs prefer a subtle, gentle approach to prevent damage to their territory. They employ their magic to make the forest an unappealing place to explore by temporarily diverting springs, driving away game, stealing critical tools, and altering trails to leave hunting or lumber parties hopelessly lost. The firbolgs' presence is marked by an absence of animals and a strange quiet, as if the forest wishes to avoid attracting attention to itself. The faster travelers decide to move on, the better.
	If these tactics fail, the firbolgs take more direct action. Their observations of a settlement determine what happens next. If the outsiders seem peaceful, the firbolgs approach and gently ask them to leave, even offering food and other supplies to aid their departure. If those who insist on remaining respect nature, take only what they need, and live in harmony with the wood, firbolgs explore the possibility of friendship with them, as long as the outsiders vow to safeguard the forest. If the settlers clearly display evil intentions, however, the firbolgs martial their strength and magic for a single overwhelming attack.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Outcast Adventurers</name>
      <text>As guardians of the wood, few firbolgs would dream of leaving their homes or attempting to fit into human society. An exiled firbolg, or one whose clan has been destroyed, might not have a choice in the matter. Most adventuring firbolgs fall into this latter category.
	Outcast firbolgs can never return home. They committed some unforgivable deed, usually something that put their homeland at risk, such as starting a forest fire or killing a rare or beautiful wild creature. These firbolgs are loners who wander the world in hope of finding a new place to call home.
	Orphaned firbolgs are those whose clans or home lands have been destroyed. They become crusaders for nature, seeking to avenge their loss and prevent the further destruction of the natural world.
	A few rare firbolgs are entrusted by their clan with an important mission that takes them beyond their homes. These firbolgs feel like pilgrims in a strange land, and usually they wish only to complete their quests and return home as quickly as possible.
	The Firbolg Adventurers table can serve as inspiration for determining why a firbolg character leaves home.

	By the same token, their tribe names merely refer to their homes. When dealing with other races, firbolgs refer to their lands by whatever name the surrounding folk use, as a matter of tact and hospitality, but among their own kind they simply call it "home."

      <text>Goblins occupy an uneasy place in a dangerous world, and they react by lashing out at any creatures they believe they can bully. Cunning in battle and cruel in victory, goblins are fawning and servile in defeat, just as in their own society lower castes must scrape before those of greater status and as goblin tribes bow before other goblinoids.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Beast Masters and Slave Drivers</name>
      <text>Goblins know they are a weak, unsophisticated race that can be easily dominated by bigger, smarter, more organized, more ferocious, or more magical creatures. Their god was conquered by Maglubiyet, after all, and now when the Mighty One calls for it, even their souls are forfeit. It is this realization that drives them to dominate other creatures whenever they can — for goblins, life is short.
	Goblins seek to trap and enslave any creatures they encounter, but they flee from opposition that seems too daunting. For miles around their lair, they employ pit traps, snares, and nets to catch the unwary, and when their hunting patrols encounter other beings, they always look for ways to capture their foes instead of killing them. Goblins that run up against the fringes of a society first test its defenses by stealing objects, and if these crimes go unpunished, they begin stealing people.
	Enslaved creatures receive the worst treatment the goblins can dish out while still getting decent performance out of the slaves. But humanoids and monsters that are especially capable or that provide unusual services find themselves treated like favored (though occasionally abused) pets.
	Virtually any kind of creature that can be browbeaten into service might be found with a goblin tribe, but rats and wolves are nearly always present. Both have lived in concert with goblins for at least as long as humans have worked with dogs and horses, and in goblin society those two animals serve similar purposes.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Family Matters</name>
      <text>A goblin tribe is organized in a four-tiered caste system made up of lashers, hunters, gatherers, and pariahs. The status of every family in the tribe is based on its importance to the tribe's survival. Families that belong to the higher-ranking castes keep their status by not sharing their knowledge and skills with other families, while those in the lower castes have little hope of escaping their plight.
	Outsiders who don't understand the goblins' social system are sometimes surprised by how different castes interact with them. A single human warrior might frighten away a dozen gatherers, only to be shocked when two hunters viciously attack. A captured group of invaders might hang in a net while dozens of goblins pass by and pay them no heed until a group of gatherers shows up.

Lashers. The closest thing a goblin tribe has to nobility is the caste of lashers — families of goblins trained in the ways of battle, and also possessed of key skills such as strategy, trap-building, beast taming, mining, smelting, forging, and religion. If the tribe has any spellcasters, this caste includes them. Lashers follow the lead of the tribe's boss, and enforce their will on other goblins with whips.

Hunters. The families of goblins that are skilled in the use of weapons but not privy to any other special knowledge have the second highest status in the tribe. Hunters are often the best wolf riders and know the most about the territory farthest from the tribe's lair. These individuals hunt game in peaceful times, and in combat they serve as scouts, foot soldiers, and cavalry.

Gatherers. Families in the second lowest caste are responsible for getting food from the surrounding area, taking what's naturally available or stealing whatever they can. Gatherers also do the little amount of farming of which goblins are capable and are charged with checking traps for captured people or beasts. Gatherers aren't usually armed with weapons more deadly than a sling or a knife, but they frequently carry nets, caltrops, lassos, and nooses on poles for controlling captured creatures. These goblins cook for the tribe, and in times of war they are also responsible for making poison.
	Gatherers, and the pariahs beneath them, greatly fear for their lives in battle, believing that the lashers and the hunters have special knowledge of how to survive. It is the members of the lower castes that give goblins their reputation for cowardice.

Pariahs. Some goblin families are the lowest of the low, composed of the most dimwitted, least educated, and weakest goblins. They get the worst jobs: mucking out animal pens, cleaning up after other goblins, and doing any hard labor such as digging mines. If the goblin tribe has slaves to do some of this work, the pariah families enjoy the opportunity to supervise and dominate such creatures, which have no status at all.</text>

      <name>Status Symbols</name>
      <text>Goblins love symbols of authority, and thus the tribe's boss often has such trappings wherever he or she goes. Such a symbol can take a typical form, perhaps a crown or a throne, but also can be a more distinctive objects like a high-backed wolf saddle or colorful boots. The castes in a tribe also adopt symbols to indicate membership or kinship, but the symbols used are rarely the same between different tribes and often make little sense to other creatures. Some possible status symbols are given in the Status Symbols table. A caste or a boss might display more than one of these items.

Status Symbols:
d20 | Status Symbol
1 | Earrings and notches in an ear
2 | Rib bones tied into hair
3 | A belt made from raccoon pelts
4 | A gnome's boot used as a hat

      <name>Booyahgs</name>
      <text>Spellcasters of any sort among the goblins are rare. Goblins typically lack the intelligence and patience needed to learn and practice wizardry, and they fare poorly even when given access to the necessary training and knowledge. Sorcerers are less prevalent among them than in many other races, and Khurgorbaeyag seems to dislike sharing his divine power with his followers. And although many goblins would readily offer anything to have the abilities of a warlock, the patrons that grant such power know a goblin is unlikely to be able to uphold its end of any bargain.
	Even when a goblin is born with the ability to become a spellcaster, the knowledge and talent necessary to carry on the tradition rarely persists for more than a couple of generations. Because they have so little experience with magic, goblins make no distinction between its forms. To them all magic is "booyahg," and the word is part of the name they give to any of its practitioners. A goblin with access to booyahg becomes a member of the lashers and can often rise to the role of boss.

Booyahg Caster. This goblin served under a hobgoblin wizard, stole a look at its master's spellbook, and learned a little wizardry by aping the gestures and words it remembered. The goblin can cast a randomly determined 1st-level wizard spell once per day. Intelligence is its spellcasting ability.

Booyahg Wielder. This goblin found a magic item (a necklace of fireballs, a circlet of blasting, or the like) and learned how to use it.

Booyahg Whip. Khurgorbaeyag saw fit to gift this goblin with powers that enable it to dominate others. The goblin has 1d3 other goblins that slavishly obey its orders.

Booyahg Slave. This goblin warlock serves a patron who can extract payment in flesh if the goblin doesn't do as promised. Often this patron is a coven of hags serving as the tribe's boss, a fiend that has made its way into the world, or an undying lord such as a lich or a vampire. (For more information on undying lord patrons, see the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide.) Use one of the warlock stat blocks in appendix B to represent this goblin, adding darkvision and the Nimble Escape traits common to all goblins.

Booyahg Booyahg Booyahg. This goblin is a sorcerer with the wild magic origin whose every casting, including cantrips, is accompanied by a wild magic surge. Use the mage stat block in the Monster Manual to represent this goblin, adding darkvision and the Nimble Escape traits common to all goblins. Each time the goblin casts a spell, there is an accompanying surge of wild magic; roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in the Player's Handbook to determine the wild magic effect.</text>

      <text>At the highest mountain peaks-far above the slopes where trees grow and where the air is thin and the frigid winds howl-dwell the reclusive goliaths. Few folk can claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still can claim friendship with one. Goliaths wander a bleak realm of rock, wind, and cold. Their bodies look as if they are carved from mountain stone and give them great physical power. Their spirits take after the wandering wind, making them nomads who wander from peak to peak. Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their frigid realm, leaving each goliath with the responsibility to earn a place in the tribe or die trying.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Driven Competitors</name>
      <text>Every day brings a new challenge to a goliath. Food, water, and shelter are rare in the uppermost mountain reaches. A single mistake can bring doom to an entire tribe, while an individual's heroic effort can ensure the entire group's survival.
	Goliaths thus place a premium on self-sufficiency and individual skill. They have a compulsion to keep score, counting their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to others. Goliaths love to win, but they see defeat as a prod to improve their skills.
	This dedication to competition has a dark side. Goliaths are ferocious competitors, but above all else they are driven to outdo their past efforts. If a goliath slays a dragon, he or she might seek out a larger, more powerful wyrm to battle. Few goliath adventurers reach old age, as most die attempting to surpass their past accomplishments.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Fair Play</name>
      <text>For goliaths, competition exists only when it is supported by a level playing field. Competition measures talent, dedication, and effort. Those factors determine survival in their home territory, not reliance on magic items, money, or other elements that can tip the balance one way or the other. Goliaths happily rely on such benefits, but they are careful to remember that such an advantage can always be lost. A goliath who relies too much on them can grow complacent, a recipe for disaster in the mountains.
	This trait manifests most strongly when goliaths interact with other folk. The relationship between peasants and nobles puzzles goliaths. If a king lacks the intelligence or leadership to lead, then clearly the most talented person in the kingdom should take his place. Goliaths rarely keep such opinions to themselves, and mock folk who rely on society's structures or rules to maintain power.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Survival of the Fittest</name>
      <text>Among goliaths, any adult who can't contribute to the tribe is expelled. A lone goliath has little chance of survival, especially an older or weaker one. Goliaths have little pity for adults who can't take care of themselves, though a sick or injured individual is treated, as a result of the goliath concept of fair play.
	A permanently injured goliath is still expected to pull his or her weight in the tribe. Typically, such a goliath dies attempting to keep up, or the goliath slips away in the night to seek the cold will of fate.
	In some ways, the goliath drive to outdo themselves feeds into the grim inevitability of their decline and death. A goliath would much rather die in battle, at the peak of strength and skill, than endure the slow decay of old age. Few folk have ever meet an elderly goliath, and even those goliaths who have left their people grapple with the urge to give up their lives as their physical skills decay.
	Because of their risk-taking, goliath tribes suffer from a chronic lack of the experience offered by longterm leaders. They hope for innate wisdom in their leadership, for they can rarely count on a wisdom grown with age.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Names</name>
      <text>Every goliath has three names: a birth name assigned by the newborn's mother and father, a nickname assigned by the tribal chief, and a family or clan name. A birth name is up to three syllables long. Clan names are five syllables or more and end in a vowel.
	Birth names are rarely linked to gender. Goliaths see females and males as equal in all things, and they find societies with roles divided by gender to be puzzling or worthy of mockery. To a goliath, the person who is best at a job should be the one tasked with doing it.
	A goliath's nickname is a description that can change on the whim of a chieftain or tribal elder. It refers to a notable deed, either a success or failure, committed by the goliath. Goliaths assign and use nicknames with their friends of other races, and change them to refer to an individual's notable deeds.
	Goliaths present all three names when identifying themselves, in the order of birth name, nickname, and clan name. In casual conversation, they use their nickname.

Birth Names: Aukan, Eglath, Gae-Al, Gauthak, Ilikan, Keothi, Kuori, Lo-Kag, Manneo, Maveith, Nalla, Orilo, Paavu, Pethani, Thalai, Thotham, Uthal, Vaunea, Vimak

      <text>Hobgoblins hold themselves to high standards of military honor. The race has a long history of shared traditions, recorded and retold to keep the knowledge fresh for new generations. When hobgoblins aren't waging war, they farm, they build, and they practice both martial and arcane arts.
	These trappings of civil society do little to conceal an underlying brutality that hobgoblins practice on each other and perfect upon other races. Punishment for infractions of hobgoblin law are swift and merciless. Beauty is something hobgoblins associate only with images of conflict and warfare.
	The iron grip their philosophy holds on their hearts blinds hobgoblins to the accomplishments of other peoples. Hobgoblins have little appreciation or patience for art. They leave little space for joy or leisure in their lives, and thus have no reserves of faith to call upon when in dire straits. </text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Implacable Gods</name>
      <text>Hobgoblins revere two gods unique to their race, the only survivors of a pantheon that was decimated by Maglubiyet so long ago that hobgoblins don't remember the names of the fallen. Nomog-Geaya is the greater of the two and the more frequently honored. He is seen as a stoic, cold-blooded, and tyrannical leader, and hobgoblins believe he expects the same behavior from them. Bargrivyek is a god of duty, unity, and discipline, and he is thought to be pleased by displays of those principles.
	In the stories that hobgoblins tell one another, Bargrivyek serves as Nomog-Geaya's second in command. Nomog-Geaya would prefer the position were filled by someone more like himself, but Bargrivyek was all he was left with after Maglubiyet's conquest. Although both deities are ultimately beholden to Maglubiyet, the greater god allows them to retain a measure of their influence over the hobgoblins because their philosophies are in line with his own.
	Hobgoblins don't build temples to their gods, lest they displease Maglubiyet, but the few priests among them do tend small shrines and interpret the body of legends about their gods. Nomog-Geaya's priests always wield his favored weapons, a longsword and a handaxe. They are responsible for martial training as well as instruction in strategy and battlefield tactics. Bargrivyek's priests wield his symbol, a flail with a head dipped in white paint. They work as a police force in hobgoblin society, making judgments about honor, mediating disputes, and otherwise enforcing discipline.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Rank, Status, and Title</name>
      <text>As in any strict military hierarchy, every hobgoblin in a legion has a rank, from the warlord down through a cadre of officers to the soldiers that make up most of its number. These ranks, using the titles most often applied to them, are as follows:

1st rank: Warlord
2nd rank: General
3rd rank: Captain
4th rank: Fatal Axe
5th rank: Spear
6th rank: Fist
7th rank: Soldier

A legion is organized into units called banners, each one made up of a group of interrelated families. Members of a banner live, work, and fight together, and each banner has a separate status within the legion that is reflected in the power of its officers. For instance, the captains of the highest-ranking banners can expect their orders to be followed by the captains of any banners of lower rank.
	Rank and responsibility aren't necessarily commensurate from one legion to another or even between banners in the same legion. A phalanx of foot soldiers led by a captain in one legion might be two hundred strong, while in another such a force numbers just twenty. One banner might have four warriors mounted on worgs led by a fist, while a fist in another banner of the same legion might lead ten mounted warriors. If any rank doesn't serve a purpose in the legion, the warlord eliminates it from the hierarchy to maximize efficiency.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Honor Bound, By Glory Crowned</name>
      <text>Advancement in rank comes as a result of attaining glory, but for the achievement to mean anything, a hobgoblin must abide by the race's code of honor in doing so.
	Glory can be earned by discovery of great resources (such as finding a new vein of iron or a powerful magic item), by fine performances (writing and performing a great ballad about the legion), by designing and constructing a great defense or monument, and through other means. But the greatest respect is reserved for those who earn their glory in battle. In theory, the fortunes of war can elevate the lowest-ranking banner in a legion to the highest status. In practice, warlords are careful to position themselves and their banners to claim the greatest victories in any conflict, and they portion out opportunities and responsibilities to other banners as politics dictate.
	Each hobgoblin legion has a distinct code of honor and law, but all follow a few general precepts that are at the heart of the hobgoblin honor system.

Follow Orders. Carrying out orders without question is critical on the battlefield, and hobgoblins follow this dictum in peaceful times as well in order to maintain stability in their society. Hobgoblins don't shrink from following orders that they know will result in death if the act will bring glory to the banner or the legion.

Honor the Gods. Hobgoblins give regular recognition to the deities left to them after Maglubiyet's conquest. Idols of Nomog-Geaya, as well as standards and flags with his image or symbol, receive a bow or salute at all times except emergencies. Bargrivyek's peacemakers receive due deference regardless of rank or banner status. Of course, Maglubiyet's call to conquest is always answered.

Suffer nor Give Insult. As befits their warlike nature, hobgoblins believe that any insult demands a response. Suitably (and somewhat ironically), the outward politeness and civility that they demonstrate among each other enables them to avoid conflicts in daily life. This same form of "courtesy" is often extended to other races the hobgoblins have dealings with, much to the outsiders' surprise. When such respect isn't reciprocated, though, relations can swiftly deteriorate.

Reward Glorious Action. Hobgoblins never deny advancement in status to a banner that has earned it, nor do they withhold higher rank from a deserving individual. If a banner attains great glory in battle but is nearly destroyed, the handful of members who remain are welcomed into another banner, taking their banner's name and colors along with them, and assuming places of leadership in the group.

Uphold the Legion. Hobgoblins care more for the survival of their legion than they do for others of their own kind. Two legions might battle over territory, resources, or power, or out of simple pride. Such a feud can continue over generations in an ongoing cycle of retribution. Each legion has a list of grievances against any others it knows about, and any legions meeting for the first time view each other with immediate hostility. Only a truly great warlord can force legions to work together as an army if Maglubiyet has not called forth a host. </text>

      <name>An Ancient Curse</name>
      <text>The kenku once served a mysterious, powerful entity on another plane of existence. Some believe they were minions of Grazz't, while others say that they were scouts and explorers for the Wind Dukes of Aaqa. Whatever the truth, according to legend, the kenku betrayed their master. Unable to resist the lure of a beautiful sparkling treasure, the kenku plotted to steal the item and escape to the Material Plane.
	Unfortunately for the kenku, their master discovered their plan before they could enact it. Enraged, the entity imposed three dreadful curses upon them. First, the kenku's beloved wings withered and fell away from their bodies, leaving them bound to the earth. Second, because their ingenuity and skill had turned toward scheming against their patron, the spark of creativity was torn from their souls. Finally, to ensure that the kenku could never divulge any secrets, their master took away their voices. Once the entity was satisfied that they had been sufficiently punished, the kenku were set loose on the Material Plane.
	Since then, the kenku have wandered the world. They settle in places that accept them, usually bleak cities that have fallen on hard times and are overrun with crime.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Dreams of Flight</name>
      <text>Above all else, kenku wish to regain their ability to fly. Every kenku is born with a desire to take to the air, and those who learn spellcasting do so in hope of mastering spells that will allow them to fly. Rumors of magic items such as flying carpets, brooms capable of flight, and similar objects provoke a great desire for the kenku to acquire the items for themselves.
	Despite their lack of wings, kenku love dwelling in towers and other tall structures. They seek out ruins that reach to the sky, though they lack the motivation and creativity to make repairs or fortify such places. Even so, their light weight and size allow them to dwell in rickety structures that would collapse beneath a human or an orc.
	Some thieves' guilds use kenku as lookouts and messengers. The kenku dwell in the tallest buildings and towers the guild controls, allowing them to lurk in the highest levels and to keep watch on the city below.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Hopeless Plagiarists</name>
      <text>As a result of their lack of creativity, kenku function comfortably as minions of a powerful master. Flock leaders enforce discipline and minimize conflicts, but they fail at effective planning or crafting longterm schemes.
	Although unable to speak in their own voices, kenku can perfectly mimic any sound they hear, from a halfling's voice to the noise of rocks clattering down a hillside. However, kenku cannot create new sounds and can communicate only by using sounds they have heard. Most kenku use a combination of overheard phrases and sound effects to convey their ideas and thoughts.
	By the same token, kenku have no ability to invent new ideas or create new things. Kenku can copy existing items with exceptional skill, allowing them to become excellent artisans and scribes. They can copy books, make replicas of objects, and otherwise thrive in situations where they can produce large numbers of identical items. Few kenku find this work satisfying, since their quest for the freedom of flight makes them ill-suited to settle into a routine.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Ideal Minions</name>
      <text>Kenku gather in groups called flocks. A flock is led by the oldest and most experienced kenku with the widest store of knowledge to draw on, often called Master.
	Although kenku can't create new things, they have a talent for learning and memorizing details. Thus, ambitious kenku can excel as superb spies and scouts. A kenku who learns of clever schemes and plans devised by other creatures can put them to use. The kenku lack the talent to improvise or alter a plan, but a wise Master sets multiple plans in motion at once, confident that underlings can follow orders to the letter.
	For this reason, many kenku make an easy living serving as messengers, spies, and lookouts for thieves' guilds, bandits, and other criminal cartels. A network of kenku can relay a bird call or similar noise across the city, alerting their allies to the approach of a guard patrol or signaling a prime opportunity for a robbery.
	Since kenku can precisely reproduce any sound, the messages they carry rarely suffer degradation or shifts in meaning. Human messengers might switch words or phrases and garble a message inadvertently, but the kenku produce perfect copies of whatever they hear.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Kenku Adventurers</name>
      <text>Kenku adventurers are usually the survivors of a flock that has sustained heavy losses, or a rare kenku who has grown weary of a life of crime. These kenku are more ambitious and daring than their fellows. Others strike out on their own in search of the secrets of flight, to master magic, or to uncover the secret of their curse and find a method to break it.
	Kenku adventurers, despite their relative independence, still have a tendency to seek out a companion to emulate and follow. A kenku loves to mimic the voice and words of its chosen companion.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Kenku Names</name>
      <text>Given that kenku can duplicate any sound, their names are drawn from a staggering variety of noises and phrases. Kenku names tend to break down into three categories that make no distinction between male and female names.
	Kenku thugs, warriors, and toughs adopt noises made by weapons, such as the clang of a mace against armor or the sound made by a breaking bone. Non-kenku refer to the kenku by describing this noise. Examples of this type of name include Smasher, Clanger, Slicer, and Basher.
	Kenku thieves, con artists, and burglars adopt animal noises, typically those common in urban settings. In this manner, kenku can call out to each other while those who overhear them mistake them for common animals. Non-kenku use names that refer to the sound made or the animal a kenku mimics, such as Rat Scratch, Whistler, Mouser, and Growler.
	Some kenku turn their back on crime to pursue legitimate trades. These kenku adopt noises made as part of their craft. A sailor duplicates the sound of a fluttering sail, while a smith mimics the clanging of a hammer on metal. Non-kenku describe these folk by their trade sounds, such as Sail Snap, Hammerer, and Cutter.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Kobolds are often dismissed as cowardly, foolish, and weak, but these little reptilian creatures actually have a strong social structure that stresses devotion to the tribe, are clever with their hands, and viciously work together in order to overcome their physical limitations.
	In the kobolds' version of a perfect world, the creatures would be left alone to dig their tunnels and raise the next generation of kobolds, all the while seeking the magic that will free their imprisoned god (see the "Kurtulmak: God of Kobolds" sidebar). In the world they occupy, kobolds are often bullied and enslaved by larger creatures-or, when they live on their own, they are constantly fearful of invasion and oppression. Although individually they are timid and shy away from conflict, kobolds are dangerous if cornered, vicious when defending their eggs, and notorious for the dangerous improvised traps they use to protect their warrens.

Source:	Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 119</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Expert Tunnelers</name>
      <text>Kobolds are naturally skilled at tunneling. Similar to dwarves, they seem to have a near-instinctive sense of what sections of stone or earth are strong or weak, are bearing a load or are safe to excavate, or are likely to contain minerals or offer access to water. This ability enables them to fashion secure homes in places where other creatures wouldn't feel safe.
	Kobolds take advantage of their size by creating small-diameter tunnels that they can easily pass through, but that require larger creatures to hunch over or even crawl to make progress. In places where a tunnel opens into a chasm and continues on the other side, the kobolds might connect the two passages with a rope bridge or some other rickety structure, designed to collapse under the weight of any creature heavier than a kobold. On occasion, the route through a kobold lair runs along a ledge that borders a cavern or a crevasse, and the kobolds might erect a railing or a wall that prevents them from falling off the edge — high enough to protect a kobold but low enough to serve as a tripping hazard for a larger creature.
	Those of other humanoid races have little good to say about kobolds, but they do admit that the little reptilians do respectable tunnel work using simple tools. If a band of kobolds is enslaved by more powerful creatures, the kobolds are usually put to work enlarging their masters' living area and protecting vital areas of the lair with traps and other defenses.
	Some human communities hire kobolds to dig their sewer tunnels, paying them with food and tools the kobolds wouldn't have access to on their own. If they are treated well and left alone to do the job, the kobolds work industriously and build a network of passages beneath the streets, connecting them to a nearby waterway and greatly improving the town's sanitation. If the kobolds like the area and aren't mistreated by the humans, they might build a warren and make a permanent home there, while continuing to expand the town's sewers as the community grows. These so-called "city kobolds" live underground but might make occasional nighttime forays up to the surface. Roughly one quarter of the towns and cities in the world have kobold communities living under them, but the kobolds are so good at staying hidden that the surface-dwelling citizens in the area often don't know what lies beneath them.
	Because the kobolds make sure they stay out of the way of anyone more dangerous than themselves, grow their own subterranean food, and prefer to sneak about at night, the people of a town might go for weeks or months without noticing evidence that kobolds are in the area, and years between actual sightings.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Able Scavengers</name>
      <text>Kobolds are adept at identifying broken, misplaced, discarded, or leftover crafted items from other creatures that can still be put to use. They prefer to scavenge objects that have clearly been lost or thrown away, which is easy to do without attracting attention. At the same time, they don't automatically shy away from trying to grab items that are the property of other creatures, because such objects are more likely to be in good condition and thus more useful or valuable.
	When they go after items that aren't free for the taking, kobolds try to remain undetected and don't give their targets reason to harm them. For example, a group of city kobolds might sneak into a cobbler's house at night to loot it of knives, leather bits, nails, and other useful items, but if they are at risk of discovery, they run away rather than attack anyone in the house. By fleeing before they can be seen or identified, they avoid getting into a situation where the townsfolk would try to hunt down all kobolds and put the tribe's survival at risk.
	Some aggressive individual kobolds and tribes do exist, but in general kobolds don't purposely provoke retaliatory attacks from the creatures they steal from. It's better to be cautious and overlooked than to be considered dangerous and a threat.
	In a couple of situations, kobolds might abandon this careful approach. First, because of their hatred of gnomes, city kobolds often go out of their way to target gnomes' houses and shops. Even in such cases, the kobolds' fear of retaliation usually prevents them from trying to directly harm the gnomes, but they might spit in the milk, balance dishes on tables so they're easily knocked over and broken, or scatter sewing needles all over the floor — petty, vengeful acts that humiliate, injure, or anger the gnomes, but not so much that the gnomes want to hunt down and kill the kobolds. Because of the kobolds' animosity, gnomes tend to avoid or abandon settlements that have a severe infestation of kobolds, and conversely kobolds are usually driven out of communities that have a large gnome population.
	Second, kobolds are always on the lookout for magic that might help them free their imprisoned god, Kurtulmak. Typical kobolds don't know how to use a wand, a spellbook, or anything with more magical power than a potion, but they all believe that the tribal sorcerer can figure out how to use any such item they come across. When kobolds sense an opportunity to separate a magic item from its owner, they are often willing to take the chance of revealing themselves because the potential reward is worth the risk.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Dragon Servitors</name>
      <text>Kobolds believe that they were created by Tiamat from the blood of dragons — a view supported by their reptilian (they would say draconic) appearance. In every kobold tribe, the legend of the creatures' origin is passed down from elder to hatchling, giving each individual and every generation a reason to feel pride and self-respect. The kobolds prefer to run away than fight, to live off the scraps of others, and they are often dominated by larger humanoids, but they know that there is greatness within them and they are proud that they were chosen to be the blood-kin of dragons.
	Kobolds willingly serve chromatic dragons and worship them as if they were demigods — mighty beings of divine descent. This isn't a casual sort of worship or lip service; kobolds are awed in the presence of a dragon, as if an actual avatar of a deity were in their presence. Kobolds fall all over themselves to obey orders from a dragon, even if they are dangerous orders. Although kobolds usually don't worship Tiamat directly, they recognize her as the dragon-goddess of all chromatic dragons, and as the master of their racial god, Kurtulmak.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Arcane Magic Users</name>
      <text>Unlike some other humanoids, kobolds don't fear or shun arcane magic. They see magic as part of their connection to dragons, and are proud to be blessed with the ability to wield such power. Young kobold sorcerers are trained by elders, and the training has an almost religious significance. Most kobold sorcerers are of the draconic bloodline origin and specialize in either damaging magic (which can also be used in mining), augmentation (of materials or allies), or divination (to find raw materials and foresee threats to the tribe).
	The main reason why kobolds depend on arcane magic rather than divine is Kurtulmak's imprisonment, which makes it difficult for him to grant spells to mortals and for those mortals to receive his favor. Furthermore, kobolds are so frail that a single hit from a human's weapon can kill one of them, so a tribe has little use for healing magic, and a sorcerer can meet most of the tribe's other magic-related needs. Kobold shamans are very rare; priests of Kurtulmak, when they reveal themselves, are easily recognized by orange garb (usually just a roughly torn sash or cloak) decorated with an image of a gnome's skull.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Life and Outlook</name>
      <text>Kobolds have a tribal society in which they all take on specialized roles that protect and sustain the tribe. The strongest kobolds are trained to be hunters and warriors, the most clever are crafters and strategists, the toughest are miners and beast-wranglers, and so on. Even a stupid or physically weak kobold is given a role in the tribe, whether something as simple as picking mushrooms for food or watching over hatchlings, and they all understand that their actions contribute to the survival of the group. The tribe practices for the eventuality of defending the lair against intruders, and their plans always include knowing the best escape routes and who is responsible for blocking tunnels to deter pursuit.
	Kobolds feel a cool affinity or something like kinship for other members of their tribe, but they are rarely affectionate with each other. Two kobolds who've known each other for over a decade might consider each other friends or enemies, but the strength of this sentiment is much fainter than any comparable human emotion. Since most of their waking time is spent working, adversarial kobolds rarely have opportunities to exchange insults, let alone come to blows over their differences.
	Kobolds choose mates primarily for convenience. Their lack of emotional bonding means they have no concept of marriage or permanent family relationships. Their eggs are placed in a common tribal hatchery with no effort to keep track of who each one's mother is. This practice and the communal raising of the hatchlings mean that the tribe operates like a group of cousins.
	Because they lay eggs, and the eggs don't require much tending, kobold females aren't exempted from war or work. Furthermore, kobolds can slowly change sex. If most males or females of a tribe are killed, some survivors change over several months until the tribe is balanced again. In this way, the tribe can quickly repopulate with just a few survivors. Because of these factors, kobolds don't have assigned gender roles for young or adults. A leader, sorcerer, miner, or crafter is as likely to be female as male.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Grow Fast, Die Early</name>
      <text>Kobolds grow and mature much more swiftly than members of other humanoid races. At 6 years old a kobold is considered an adult. Most succumb to violence, accidents, or disease by age 20, but a kobold can live for up to 120 years — a longevity they attribute to being distantly related to dragons. A female can lay up to six eggs per year, and an egg matures for two to three months before it hatches.
	Kobolds don't engage in funeral ceremonies; a dead kobold's body is burned or disposed of in some other convenient way (or, in a cannibalistic tribe, eaten). Kobolds believe that if they die in service to their tribe, Kurtulmak immediately sends each of them back to life as the next egg laid in the hatchery. If a particularly important or respected member of a tribe dies, the hatchery is closely monitored. The next egg laid is immediately separated from the rest and carefully protected. Once it hatches, the resultant young kobold is groomed to fill a position of importance.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Food and Cannibalism</name>
      <text>Although their sharp teeth would suggest they are carnivores, kobolds are actually omnivores, and can eat just about anything, including meat, fruit, tree bark, bone, leather, and eggshells (a newly hatched kobold's first meal is usually its own shell). A hungry tribe leaves nothing behind from a kill, eating everything that's edible and using the rest to make tools or adornments.
	Kobolds shed teeth as they wear out and grow new ones their entire lives. Many wear their own shed teeth as jewelry, with more teeth indicating an older — and wiser — kobold. Some unscrupulous individuals wear teeth stolen or harvested from others in an attempt to make them seem older and more respectable.
	Most kobold tribes avoid eating what they call "talking meat" — intelligent creatures — because such behavior prompts retaliation. The fear of starvation can make them flexible about this principle, however, and if their options are either attacking such creatures or going hungry, kobolds are practical. A few tribes, particularly those in lightly populated areas, practice cannibalism, believing it is foolish to waste good meat.
	In any case, kobolds that eat humanoids don't simply start consuming corpses or prisoners right after a battle; they're more inclined to tie their victims to saplings and slowly roast them over a fire, or put them in a giant cook pot to make stew. Fortunately for the prisoners, the kobolds' almost comedic preparations sometimes give rescuers time to locate and free the captives before the kobolds settle down for the main course.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Hatred</name>
      <text>Because the gnome god Garl Glittergold trapped the kobold god Kurtulmak in an inescapable maze, kobolds are bitterly hateful toward gnomes. Although they usually don't seek out gnomes to do them violence, if hostile kobolds encounter a mixed group of gnomes and other humanoids, the kobolds instinctively attack the gnomes. Kobolds in battle with gnomes are much less likely to run away because their hatred overrules their sense of self-preservation.
	A kobold's cautious nature doesn't mean it can't get angry. The blood of dragons flows in its veins, and like a raging drake, a kobold that is pushed too far or has its back against the wall can become a miniature storm of fangs and claws as it desperately tries to defend its life. Likewise, kinship to their own tribe can prompt kobolds to battle another kobold tribe for resources or territory. Such conflicts aren't common, because two tribes will always prefer to expand in different directions if they come into contact, but they do happen.
	For example, two neighboring tribes that want exclusive claim to a flock of mountain goats might skirmish with each other every few days. Eventually the leader of one warring tribe realizes it is losing due to attrition and moves its tribe to another area, ceding the contested territory to its more successful neighbors.
	As demonstrated by their hatred of gnomes, kobolds have a persecution complex and easily take offense at the actions or deeds of other races. They aren't forgiving of other races, and they enjoy nursing their hatred until they get a chance to wreak revenge on a creature or a race that has wronged them.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Environment</name>
      <text>Kobolds are cold-blooded and thus prefer temperate and tropical climates. Kobold tribes in colder regions tend to be smaller in population and more aggressive in their hunting, since food is relatively scarce in such areas.
	Partly out of fear and partly because their eyes are sensitive to sunlight, kobolds prefer the security of a cave to living in the open air, and can be found in any sort of terrain that can support tunneling. In a swamp or along a coastline where digging into the soft ground is problematic, kobolds entrench themselves in dense woods, hills, or large rock outcroppings, creating warrens above the water line.
	Kobolds reside most commonly in hilly or mountainous terrain. Such locations usually have natural caves suitable for living space, plenty of room to dig, and ready sources of food. Although lairing in these locations puts kobolds in competition with surface-dwelling humanoids, their ability to avoid detection often means their warrens go unnoticed by their larger rivals. If it's lucky, a tribe of kobolds that is discovered by a group of larger humanoids might form a mutually beneficial arrangement, relying on the humanoids for protection from invaders and in return providing services such as excavating new living spaces and disposing of trash. If it's unlucky, the tribe is enslaved by the other humanoids, and the kobolds serve similar roles but under threat of death.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Roleplaying a Kobold</name>
      <text>A kobold acknowledges its weakness in the face of a hostile world. It knows it is puny, bigger creatures will exploit it, it will probably die at a young age, and its life will be full of toil. Although this outlook seems bleak, a kobold finds satisfaction in its work, the survival of its tribe, and the knowledge that it shares a heritage with the mightiest of dragons.
	A kobold isn't clever, but it isn't as stupid as an orc. Someone can fool a kobold with smooth words or a quick wit, but when the kobold figures out it has been tricked, it remembers the affront. If it gets an opportunity to do so, it will retaliate against that person somehow, even if in merely a petty way.
	A kobold doesn't like being cornered or alone. It wants to know it has a safe path for escape, or at least an ally nearby to improve its chances. A kobold without either of these options will be nervous, its behavior alternating between meek silence and hysteria.</text>

      <text>Only a fool looks at the lizardfolk and sees nothing more than scaly humanoids. Their physical shape notwithstanding, lizardfolk have more in common with iguanas or dragons than they do with humans, dwarves, or elves. Lizardfolk possess an alien and inscrutable mindset, their desires and thoughts driven by a different set of basic principles than those of warm-blooded creatures. Their dismal swamp homes might lie hundreds of miles from the nearest human settlement, but the gap between their way of thinking and that of the smooth-skins is far greater.
	Despite their alien outlook, some lizardfolk make an effort to understand and, in their own manner, befriend people of other races. Such lizardfolk make faithful and skilled allies.

      <name>Alien Minds</name>
      <text>The lizardfolk's reptilian nature comes through not only in their appearance, but also in how they think and act. Lizardfolk experience a more limited emotional life than other humanoids. Like most reptiles, their feelings largely revolve around fear, aggression, and pleasure. Lizardfolk experience most feelings as detached descriptions of creatures and situations. For example, humans confronted by an angry troll experience fear on a basic level. Their limbs shake, their thinking becomes panicked and jumbled, and they react by instinct. The emotion of fear takes hold and controls their actions. In contrast, lizardfolk see emotions as traits assigned to other creatures, objects, and situations. A lizardfolk doesn't think, "I'm scared." Instead, aggressive, stronger creatures register to the lizardfolk as fearsome beings to be avoided if possible. If such creatures attack, lizardfolk flee, fighting only if cornered. Lizardfolk aren't scared of a troll; instead, they understand that a troll is a fearsome, dangerous creature and react accordingly.
	Lizardfolk never become angry in the way others do, but they act with aggression toward creatures that they could defeat in a fight and that can't be dealt with in some other manner. They are aggressive toward prey they want to eat, creatures that want to harm them, and so on.
	Pleasurable people and things make life easier for lizardfolk. Pleasurable things should be preserved and protected, sometimes at the cost of the lizardfolk's own safety. The most pleasurable creatures and things are ones that allow lizardfolk to assess more situations as benign rather than fearsome.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Cold and Calculating</name>
      <text>Most humanoids describe cold-blooded people as lacking in emotion and empathy. The same label serves as an apt depiction of lizardfolk. Lacking any internal emotional reactions, lizardfolk behave in a distant manner. They don't mourn fallen comrades or rage against their enemies. They simply observe and react as a situation warrants.
	Lizardfolk lack meaningful emotional ties to the past. They assess situations based on their current and future utility and importance. Nowhere does this come through as strongly as when lizardfolk deal with the dead. To a lizardfolk, a comrade who dies becomes a potential source of food. That companion might have once been a warrior or hunter, but now the body is just freshly killed meat.
	A lizardfolk who lives among other humanoids can, over time, learn to respect other creatures' emotions. The lizardfolk doesn't share those feelings, but instead assesses them in the same clinical manner. Yes, the fallen dwarf might be most useful as a meal, but hacking the body into steaks provokes aggression in the other humanoids and makes them less helpful in battle.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Utility and Survival</name>
      <text>The lizardfolk mindset might seem unnecessarily cruel, but it helps them survive in a hostile environment. The swamps they inhabit are filled with a staggering variety of threats. Lizardfolk focus on survival above all, without sentiment. Lizardfolk assess everyone and everything in terms of utility. Art and beauty have little meaning for them. A sharp sword serves a useful and good purpose, while a dull sword is a dead weight without a whetstone.
	Lizardfolk see little need to plan more than a season or so into the future. This approach allows them to maintain their current level of influence in the world, but it limits their growth. Lizardfolk have no interest in developing writing, making long-term plans, or cultivating other methods to progress beyond their simple existence as hunters and gatherers.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Hapless Soft Ones</name>
      <text>At their core, lizardfolk view other humanoids with an indifference verging on pity. Born into the world lacking stout scales and sharp teeth, it's a wonder they have managed to survive for so long. The typical human would barely make it through a day in the swamps.
	Still, if other creatures prove useful to lizardfolk, those creatures can trigger a protective response made all the stronger by their apparent weakness. The lizardfolk assess such beings as hatchlings, young ones incapable of protecting themselves but who might prove useful in the future if they receive care.</text>

      <name>Lizardfolk Names</name>
      <text>Lizardfolk take their names from the Draconic language. They use simple descriptives granted by the tribe based on an individual's notable deeds or actions. For example, Garurt translates as "axe," a name given to a lizardfolk warrior who defeated an orc and claimed his foe's weapon. A lizardfolk who likes to hide in a stand of reeds before ambushing an animal might be called Achuak, which means "green" to describe how she blends into the foliage.
	Lizardfolk make no distinction between male and female in their naming conventions. Each example name includes its translation in parenthesis.

      <text>To feel the thunder of orcish war drums outside the gate and to hear a chorus of voices growling, "Gruumsh!" is the nightmare of every civilized place in the world. For no matter how thick its walls, skilled its archers, or brave its knights, few settlements have ever withstood a full-scale onslaught of orcs. Every soldier who lives through a fight with orcs tells of confronting a hulking foe that can cleave through a warrior with a single blow, part of a force that can cut down enemies as though they were trembling stalks of wheat before the scythe. Only a skilled and determined hero can hope to survive single combat with an orc.
	Savage and fearless, orc tribes are ever in search of elves, dwarves, and humans to destroy. Motivated by their hatred of the civilized races of the world and their need to satisfy the demands of their deities, the orcs know that if they fight well and bring glory to their tribe, Gruumsh will call them home to the plane of Acheron. It is there in the afterlife where the chosen ones will join Gruumsh and his armies in their endless extraplanar battle for supremacy.

      <name>Gods of the Orcs</name>
      <text>Orcs believe their gods to be invincible. They see the principles that define them and their deities at work every day in the world around them — nature rewards the strong and mercilessly eliminates the weak and the infirm. Orcs don't revere their gods as much as they fear them; every tribe has superstitions about how to avert their wrath or bring their favor. This deep-seated uncertainty and fear comes forth in the form of savagery and relentlessness, as orcs ravage and kill to appease the gods in order to avoid their terrible retribution.
	At the pinnacle of the orc pantheon is Gruumsh One-Eye, who created the orcs and continues to direct their destiny. He is aided and abetted by the other warrior deities, Bahgtru and Ilneval, who bring strength and cunning to the battlefield. The followers of all three gods are a tribe's raiders and ravagers—often the only part of an orc tribe that its victims ever see.
	Deep within the den of a tribe, far away from the war-hearth where warriors gather and celebrate, dwell the followers of Yurtrus, the god of disease and death, and Shargaas, the god of darkness and the unknown. Orcs too weak for battle (because of bodily weakness, malformation, injury, or age) often join these cults instead of facing daily humiliation, exile, or death.
	Serving as the bridge between the two parts of the tribe are the priestesses of Luthic, the orc goddess who represents both life and the grave. It is her worshipers that raise young orcs to be warriors, and then, at the end of their lives, take them to Yurtrus and Shargaas to be carried into death and the great unknown.</text>

      <text>Hailing from a strange and distant land, wandering tabaxi are catlike humanoids driven by curiosity to collect interesting artifacts, gather tales and stories, and lay eyes on all the world's wonders. Ultimate travelers, the inquisitive tabaxi rarely stay in one place for long. Their innate nature pushes them to leave no secrets uncovered, no treasures or legends lost.

      <name>Wandering Outcasts</name>
      <text>Most tabaxi remain in their distant homeland, content to dwell in small, tight clans. These tabaxi hunt for food, craft goods, and largely keep to themselves.
	However, not all tabaxi are satisfied with such a life. The Cat Lord, the divine figure responsible for the creation of the tabaxi, gifts each of his children with one specific feline trait. Those tabaxi gifted with curiosity are compelled to wander far and wide. They seek out stories, artifacts, and lore. Those who survive this period of wanderlust return home in their elder years to share news of the outside world. In this manner, the tabaxi remain isolated but never ignorant of the world beyond their home.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Barterers of Lore</name>
      <text>Tabaxi treasure knowledge rather than material things. A chest filled with gold coins might be useful to buy food or a coil of rope, but it's not intrinsically interesting. In the tabaxi's eyes, gathering wealth is like packing rations for a long trip. It's important to survive in the world, but not worth fussing over.
	Instead, tabaxi value knowledge and new experiences. Their ears perk up in a busy tavern, and they tease out stories with offers of food, drink, and coin. Tabaxi might walk away with empty purses, but they mull over the stories and rumors they collected like a miser counting coins.
	Although material wealth holds little attraction for the tabaxi, they have an insatiable desire to find and inspect ancient relics, magical items, and other rare objects. Aside from the power such items might confer, a tabaxi takes great joy in unraveling the stories behind their creation and the history of their use.</text>

      <text>Wandering tabaxi are mercurial creatures, trading one obsession or passion for the next as the whim strikes. A tabaxi's desire burns bright, but once met it disappears to be replaced with a new obsession. Objects remain intriguing only as long as they still hold secrets.
	A tabaxi rogue could happily spend months plotting to steal a strange gem from a noble, only to trade it for passage on a ship or a week's lodging after stealing it. The tabaxi might take extensive notes or memorize every facet of the gem before passing it on, but the gem holds no more allure once its secrets and nature have been laid bare.</text>

      <name>Tinkers and Minstrels</name>
      <text>Curiosity drives most of the tabaxi found outside their homeland, but not all of them become adventurers. Tabaxi who seek a safer path to satisfy their obsessions become wandering tinkers and minstrels.
	These tabaxi work in small troupes, usually consisting of an elder, more experienced tabaxi who guides up to four young ones learning their way in the world. They travel in small, colorful wagons, moving from settlement to settlement. When they arrive, they set up a small stage in a public square where they sing, play instruments, tell stories, and offer exotic goods in trade for items that spark their interest. Tabaxi reluctantly accept gold, but they much prefer interesting objects or pieces of lore as payment.
	These wanderers keep to civilized realms, preferring to bargain instead of pursuing more dangerous methods of sating their curiosity. However, they aren't above a little discreet theft to get their claws on a particularly interesting item when an owner refuses to sell or trade it.</text>

      <name>Aquatic Crusaders</name>
      <text>Centuries ago, tritons entered the world in response to the growing threat of evil elementals. Tritons waged many wars against their enemies on the Plane of Water, driving them into the Darkened Depths where they escaped into the crushing pressure and utter darkness. In time, the tritons noticed that their ancient elemental foes had grown quiet. Expeditions to the depths revealed that krakens, sahuagin, and far worse foes had fled the Plane of Water for the Material Plane.
	The tritons, driven by a sense of duty and responsibility, would not allow their foes to escape so easily. A great conclave of tritons chose volunteers skilled in weapons and magic as part of an expeditionary force to enter the Material Plane and seek out their enemies.
	Those tritons spread across the world's oceans and established protectorates to watch over deep sea trenches, portals, undersea caves, and other locations where their enemies might lurk. They defeated their foes when they found them and drove the rest into hiding.
	With their foes banished to the deepest reaches of the sea, tritons settled in to watch for any sign of their return. Over time, the tritons extended their stewardship over the sea floor from their initial settlements and built outposts to create trade with other races. Despite this expansion, few folk know of them. Their settlements are so remote even merfolk and sea elves rarely encounter them.</text>

	This attitude might grate on others, but it arises from a seed of truth. Few know of the tritons' great victories over dreadful undersea threats. The tritons make little allowance for such ignorance and are delighted to expound upon the great debt others owe them.
	Tritons also have a tendency to emerge from their isolation under the assumption that other folk will welcome them as respected allies and mentors. Again, distance drives much of this attitude. The tritons' limited view of the world leaves them ignorant of the kingdoms, wars, and other struggles of the surface world. Tritons readily see such concerns as minor events, a sideshow to the tritons' role as the world's true protectors.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Staunch Champions</name>
      <text>Despite their off-putting manners, tritons are benevolent creatures at heart, convinced that other civilized races deserve their protection. Their attitude might grate, but when pirate fleets prowl the waves or a kraken awakens from its slumber, they are among the first to take up arms to protect others.
	Tritons readily sacrifice themselves for the common good. They will fight and die for humans, merfolk, and other creatures without question. Their self-absorbed nature makes them overlook the history of other creatures, but they also endure a sense of guilt over allowing the evils of the Plane of Water to enter the Material Plane and threaten its inhabitants. The tritons believe they owe a debt of honor to the world, and they will fight and die to pay it.
	At times their fervor and ignorance of the world can lead them astray. Tritons encountering other creatures for the first time can underestimate them, leaving the tritons vulnerable to deception. With their strong martial tradition, tritons can sometimes be too eager to leap into a fight.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Strangers to the Surface</name>
      <text>Given their isolation, most tritons have never been to the surface world. They struggle with the idea that they can't easily move up and down out of water, and the changing of the seasons mystifies them.
	Tritons also find the variety of social institutions, kingdoms, and other customs bewildering. For all their proud culture, they remain innocent of the surface world. The typical triton protectorate is tightly regimented, organized, and unified around a common cause. A triton on the surface becomes easily confused by the bewildering array of alliances, rivalries, and petty grievances that prevent the surface folk from truly unifying.
	At its worst, a triton's arrogance compounds the tendency for the triton not to understand the ways of the surface world.
	It's easy for a triton to blame baffling social practices on what the triton perceives as the barbarism, weakness, or cowardice of surface folk.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The serpent creatures known as yuan-ti are all that remains of an ancient, decadent human empire. Ages ago their dark gods taught them profane, cannibalistic rituals to mix their flesh with that of snakes, producing a caste-based society of hybrids in which the most snakelike are the leaders and the most humanlike are spies and agents in foreign lands.

    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Humans Transformed</name>
      <text>The people who became yuan-ti were one of the original human civilizations. Their society built great temples of stone and forged metal into armor, tools, and weapons. In their ceremonies they paid homage to the snake as the embodiment of the qualities they most appreciated. They developed a philosophy of separating emotion from intellectual pursuits, allowing them to focus their energy on personal advancement and expanding their territory. They believed themselves to be the most enlightened mortals in the world, and in their hubris they sought to become ever greater.
	The serpent gods of the primordial world heeded the prayers of these people and hissed dark demands into their ears. The people tainted their souls by performing human sacrifices in the name of the gods, debased their flesh by cannibalizing their victims, and then performed a sorcerous ritual while writhing in pools filled with living snakes that enabled them to mix their flesh with that of serpents, becoming like the gods in body, thought, and emotion. Freed from the limitations of their human bodies, the yuan-ti used their new abilities to conquer new lands and expand their borders.  </text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>One Race, Many Forms</name>
      <text>The bodies of all yuan-ti have a mix of humanlike and snakelike parts, but the proportion varies from individual to individual. After the initial metamorphosis of the humans, their society quickly coalesced into a caste system based on how complete a person's transformation was. The vast majority of yuan-ti fall into three categories-abominations, malisons, and purebloods-while the mutated broodguards and exceedingly rare anathemas have their place in the hierarchy as well.
	All yuan-ti can interbreed. Females usually lay clutches of eggs, which are stored in a common hatchery, although live births aren't uncommon. A mating between yuan-ti of different types almost always produces eggs that hatch into yuan-ti of the weaker parent, so most choose partners of the same type in the interest of maintaining the strength of their personal bloodline.
	The yuan-ti have abandoned their humanity and consider non-serpentine humanoids to be lesser creatures, barely more civilized than common apes. Although some purebloods are able to reproduce with humans, most are disgusted by the idea and would do so only if seduction is necessary for a pureblood to preserve a role as a confidant or advisor in human society. The very rare offspring of such a union are always purebloods, although they may appear fully human at birth and for several years afterward.
	The yuan-ti know rituals that can transform an individual into a more powerful type. The cost and time required to perform the ritual is prohibitive, and as a result most yuan-ti never get the opportunity to undergo such a transformation. Every use of the ritual must be modified to suit the individual undergoing transformation, and requires rare herbs, exotic magical substances, snakes, and one or more humans to be sacrificed and eaten as part of the procedure.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Undercover Empire</name>
      <text>The human civilization that gave rise to the yuan-ti was among the richest in the mortal world. It rapidly progressed in metalworking, using keen intellect and magic to discover the secrets of making steel. Its military shattered rival tribes and developed advanced tactics for fighting in forests and open plains.
	The civilization grew into a cluster of allied city-states. Conquered neighbors were allowed to keep their leaders and culture so long as they paid tribute, swore allegiance to the victors, and incorporated their conquerors' serpent gods into their religions. These victories sent a constant influx of food, ore, and slaves back to the home cities.
	The wealth of the empire allowed the ruling elite plenty of time to focus on intellectual pursuits. These nobles turned to philosophy and prayer, offering gifts of magic and animal sacrifices to their serpent gods, paying homage to the perfection of the ophidian form. The serpent gods taught the humans how to take on aspects of the snake, but the cost of the change was high, requiring many sacrifices for each person to be transformed. Entire households of slaves in one city-state were killed and eaten to create the first yuan-ti, and once the news of how to perform these rituals spread to other leaders, the call for slaves to fuel the process increased. As the serpent gods began to demand more and more sacrifices, the yuan-ti stepped up their raids on bordering settlements to meet this need.
	The physical and magical prowess of the yuan-ti empire allowed the former humans to retain their holdings for several hundred years, until a combination of drought, attacks by enemies (including dragons and nagas), civil war, torpor among the serpent gods, and the development of iron weapons by the some of their conquered enemies finally loosened the yuan-ti's hold over nearby lands. The serpent people withdrew to their fortified cities and underground temples, ceding the rest of their territory to their former minions. The yuan-ti crawled away and hid in a matter of weeks, all but disappearing from the world. Yuan-ti structures throughout the land were torn down to celebrate liberation from the snake-bodied oppressors, and within a few generations the yuan-ti were all but forgotten by the new humanoid civilizations.
	For over a thousand years after their empire fell, the yuan-ti remained ensconced in their hidden strongholds, biding their time until they were ready to strike again. Today, with their numbers greatly depleted and their enemies much stronger than in ages past, the yuan-ti know they can't resort to direct attacks in order to reclaim their rightful place in the world. Operating out of the subterranean ruins of their buildings in foreign lands, yuan-ti agents infiltrate enemy governments to discover weaknesses that their leaders can exploit. The yuan-ti look forward to the day when their empire rises again and spreads across the world like venom through the blood, as it once did.
	Because their population is so small, the yuan-ti are aware they are vulnerable in open warfare. Instead, their current plans assume they will never rule outwardly in human society, so they gain influence by controlling enemy rulers-and those close to them-through blackmail, drugs, magic, and the subterfuge of disguised purebloods.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Serpent Cults</name>
      <text>Some humans believe that not only are the yuan-ti superior to humans and worthy of emulation, but they are also the blessed emissaries of the serpent gods. From these entwined beliefs are born the serpent cults, groups of devout mortals who serve the yuan-ti either directly or in foreign outposts. Fanatical in their ideals, these cultists are willing to die for the yuan-ti and their gods, whether from an enemy's weapon or at the point of a sacrificial knife.
	The yuan-ti use the cults devoted to them as a steady supply of willing minions and sycophants. Many yuan-ti establish or encourage cults to gather the special herbs and magic they need to perform the ritual for evolving into a more powerful form. And just as the yuan-ti have rituals to transform their own bodies, they have a ritual that can change a human into a pureblood. They sometimes use the promise of this ritual as an enticement for power-hungry followers or a reward for their most devoted cultists.
	In civilized society, cultists ingratiate themselves into the local populace, usually by promising perfection of the flesh (sometimes including the healing of afflictions), freedom from the ideas of sin and guilt, and hedonistic delights to those who join the cult. The leader of a cult is usually advised by a pureblood that relays orders and information between the cult and a yuan-ti city.</text>

      <name>Yuan-ti Names</name>
      <text>Yuan-ti names have meanings that have been passed down through the generations, although spellings and inflections have changed over time.
	Some yuan-ti add more sibilants to their birth names to create an exaggerated hissing sound, based on one's personal preference and whether an individual's anatomy can more easily pronounce the name in this altered form. An adopted name of this sort is recognized as a variant of the birth name, rather than a unique name unto itself. A yuan-ti might refer to itself by its birth name, by its adopted name, or (especially among pure-bloods) by a name it borrows from the local populace.

      <text>What many tortles consider a simple life, others might call a life of adventure.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Life of a Tortle</name>
      <text>A tortle hatches from a thick-shelled egg and spends the first few weeks of its life crawling on all fours. Its parents, old and near death, spend what little time they have left telling stories to their offspring. Within a year, the young tortle becomes an orphan, though not before it learns to speak and to survive on its own.
	A young tortle and its siblings inherit whatever tools, weapons, and gifts their parents left behind. Each young tortle is expected to fend for itself. It leaves the place of its birth and finds its own corner of the wilderness in which to hunt, catch fish, and get by. With each passing year, a tortle hones its survival skills. It forms friend-ships with its neighbors while also respecting their privacy. At some point, a tortle feels an almost overwhelming urge to venture far away from home and see more of the world. It gathers up its possessions and heads into the wilderness, returning months or years later with stories of its exploits and new skills.
	When a tortle nears the end of its natural lifespan, it seeks out a mate and procreates. Tortles lay their eggs (numbering as few as one to as many as a dozen) in a fortified compound enclosed by stone walls that are easily defensible. If no such compound exists, they build one. The parents spend the remainder of their lives guarding the compound, defending their offspring, and sharing a lifetime of knowledge before they die. When the children are old enough to leave the compound, they pick up whatever weapons and tools their parents left behind and set out on their own.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Beliefs</name>
      <text>Tortles don't have their own pantheon of gods, but they often worship the gods of other races. It's not unusual for a tortle to hear stories or legends related to a god and choose to worship that deity. In the Forgotten Realms, tortles are especially fond of Eldath, Gond, Lathander, Savras, Selûne, and Tymora. In the Greyhawk setting, they gravitate toward Celestian, Fharlanghn, Pelor, Pholtus, and St. Cuthbert. Tortles are often drawn to the Gods of Good in Dragonlance and the Sovereign Host in Eberron. Among the nonhuman deities, Moradin and Yondalla relate to tortles most of all.
	Tortles believe that night and day watch over them and other creatures. The moon is the eye of night that watches over them in darkness, and the sun is the equally vigilant eye of day. Tortles feel most at peace when one or both of these "eyes" are looking down on them. They become more nervous and uneasy when neither orb is visible in the sky. Tortles tend to be most uncomfortable underground, where neither the sun nor the moon is visible to them.
	Blessed are the days when both the sun and moon are visible in the sky at the same time. Tortles often choose such days to leave their homes and begin a wilderness expedition, or perform some other tasks they know to be dangerous.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Adventurers at Heart</name>
      <text>Tortles have a saying: "We wear our homes on our backs." The shells they carry around provide all the shelter they require. Consequently, tortles don't feel the need to root themselves in one place for too long. A tortle settlement is primarily used as a kind of moot, where tortles can socialize with one another, share useful information, and trade with strangers in the safety of greater numbers. Tortles don't regard these settlements as places worth defending with their lives, and they will abandon a settlement when it no longer serves their needs.
	Most tortles like to see how other creatures live and discover new customs and new ways of doing things. The urge to procreate doesn't kick in until the end of a tortle's life, and a tortle can spend decades away from its native land without feeling homesick.
	Tortles embrace a simple view of the world. It is a place of wonder, and tortles see beauty in the ordinary. They live for the chance to hear a soft wind blowing through palm trees, to watch a frog croaking on a lily pad, or to stand in a crowded human marketplace.
	Tortles like to learn new skills. They craft their own tools and weapons, and they are good at building structures and fortifications. They marvel at the works of other civilized creatures, humans in particular, and can lose themselves for years in a city, studying its architectural wonders and learning skills they can put to use when building forts to contain their offspring.
	Although they spend a considerable portion of their lives in isolation, tortles are social creatures that like to form meaningful friendships. They have no inbred animus toward people of other races. In fact, a tortle will often seek out friendships with non-tortles to learn new customs and new points of view.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Tortle Names</name>
      <text>Tortles prefer simple, non-gender-specific names that are usually no more than two syllables. If a tortle doesn't like its name for whatever reason, it can change it. A tortle might change its name a dozen times in its life. Tortles don't have surnames or family names.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Grungs are aggressive froglike humanoids found in rain forests and tropical jungles. They are fiercely territorial and see themselves as superior to most other creatures.
	Grung society is a caste system. Each caste lays eggs in a separate hatching pool, and juvenile grungs join their caste upon emergence from the hatchery. All grungs are a dull greenish gray when they are born, but each individual takes on the color of its caste as it grows to adulthood. From lowest to highest caste, grungs can be green, blue, purple, red, orange, or gold.
	All grungs secrete a substance that is harmless to them but poisonous to other creatures. A grung also uses venom to poison its weapons. Grungs are always on the lookout for creatures they can capture and enslave. Grungs use slaves for all manner of menial tasks, but mostly they just like bossing them around. Slaves are fed mildly poisoned food to keep them lethargic and compliant. A creature afflicted in this way over a long period of time becomes a shell of its former self and can be restored to normalcy only by magic. Being amphibious, grungs require water to live; any grung that fails to immerse itself in water for at least 1 hour during a day becomes quite exhausted.
	Green grungs are the tribe's warriors, hunters, and laborers, and blue grungs work as artisans and in other domestic roles. Supervising and guiding both groups are the purple grungs, which serve as administrators and commanders. Red grungs are the tribe's scholars and magic users. They are superior to purple, blue, and green grungs and given proper respect even by grungs of higher status. Higher castes include orange grungs, which are elite warriors that have authority over all lesser grungs, and gold grungs, which hold the highest leadership positions. A tribe's sovereign is always a gold grung.
	A grung normally remains in its caste for life. On rare occasions, an individual that distinguishes itself with great deeds can earn an invitation to join a higher caste. Through a combination of herbal tonics and ritual magic, an elevated grung changes color and is inducted into its new caste in the same way that a juvenile of the caste would be. From then on, the grung and its progeny are members of the higher caste.

	Vlaakith commands the loyalty of the githyanki from her personal stronghold, Susurrus, also called the Palace of Whispers, which is located deep inside the floating city. She sits on her Throne of Bones, a mighty artifact fueled by the intellects of mind flayers and elder brains that were defeated by her minions. It is crafted from mind flayer skulls and extremities, and the cushion she sits on is made of leather produced from the cured remains of an elder brain. A grand statue of Gith, an obsidian monument over 100 feet tall, stands beside the palace.

      <text>The githzerai were born as a race at the end of the gith's bloody, genocidal uprising against the mind flayers. A gith named Zerthimon, who had gained a significant following during the conflict, challenged Gith's plans and her leadership. Gith was evil, the newcomer proclaimed, and she would lead the people into darkness and tyranny not unlike the one imposed by the illithids.
	Thus, no sooner had the gith defeated their sworn enemies than they were plunged into a bitter civil war. In the ensuing conflict, Zerthimon was killed and his followers, naming themselves githzerai, relocated their civilization to the plane of Limbo.
	Today, under the leadership of the Great Githzerai, Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith, the githzerai continue to stand fast against the githyanki, as well as taking their revenge on the mind flayers. Through forays into the Material Plane and other realms, they provide stiff opposition to their enemies' plans for world domination.

Duergar see themselves as the true manifestation of dwarven ideals, clever enough not to be taken in by the treacherous deceptions of Moradin and his false promises. Their period of enslavement and the revolt against the mind flayers led by their god, Laduguer, purged the influence of the other dwarven gods from their souls and thus made them into the superior race.
	Duergar have no appreciation for beauty, that ability having been erased from their minds by the mind flayers long ago and any thought of recapturing it obliterated by Moradin's betrayal. The duergar lead bleak, grim lives devoid of happiness or satisfaction, but they see that as their defining strength—the root of duergar pride, as it were—rather than a drawback to be corrected.

      <name>Shifting Seasons</name>
      <text>Eladrin are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion, and boundless magic. An eladrin is associated with one of the four seasons and has coloration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the eladrin's mood:

	• Autumn is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer's harvest is shared with all.

	• Winter is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.

	• Spring is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter's sorrow passes.

	• Summer is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy.

Some eladrin remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other eladrin transform, adopting characteristics of a new season.

When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin's current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.
	The following tables offer personality suggestions for eladrin of each season. You can roll on the tables or use them as inspiration for characteristics of your own.

Autumn:

      <text>As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
	When you reach 3rd level, your Fey Step gains an additional effect based on your season; if the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier:

	• Autumn: Immediately after you use your Fey Step, up to two creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 minute, or until you or your companions deal any damage to it.

	• Winter: When you use your Fey Step, one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before you teleport must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

	• Spring: When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.

	• Summer: Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage).</text>

Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.

Sea elves fell in love with the wild beauty of the ocean in the earliest days of the multiverse. While other elves traveled from realm to realm, the sea elves navigated the deepest currents and explored the waters across a hundred worlds. Today, they live in small, hidden communities in the ocean shallows and on the Elemental Plane of Water.
	The sea elves face as many perils in their watery world as other elves face on dry land, but none are as deadly as the sahuagin. The animosity between these two races stems from the sahuagin's ferocious territoriality. They simply won't abide any other intelligent society, and they consider the entire sea to be their domain.
	Adding to the tension, the sahuagin worship Sekolah, the shark god, while Deep Sashelas, the sea deity of the elves, is a sworn enemy of all sharks. But even if the sea elves inexplicably began worshiping Sekolah, the sahuagin still wouldn't be able to get along with them-in the grip of a blood frenzy, sahuagin will tear apart even others of their own kind!

Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.

Shadar-kai, also known as shadow fey, were a race of shadow-like fey connected to the Shadowfell. They were believed to have originated as an offshoot of elves associated with the Raven Queen, although other legends of their origins also existed, as well as shadar-kai who were connected to other deities and processes related with the Shadowfell.
	Sworn to the Raven Queen's service, the mysterious shadar-kai venture into the Material Plane from the Shadowfell to advance her will. Once they were fey like the rest of their elven kin, and now they exist in a strange state between life and death. Eladrin and shadar-kai are like reflections of each other: one bursting with emotion, the other nearly devoid of it.

      <text>A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.

Forest gnomes and rock gnomes are the gnomes most commonly encountered in the lands of the surface world. There is another subrace of gnomes rarely seen by any surface-dweller: deep gnomes, also known as svirfneblin. Guarded, and suspicious of outsiders, svirfneblin are cunning and taciturn, but can be just as kind-hearted, loyal, and compassionate as their surface cousins.

      <text>To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus, overlord of the Nine Hells (and many of the other powerful devils serving under him) into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children's children will always be held accountable.

Glasya, Hell's criminal mastermind, grants her tieflings magic that is useful for committing heists.

      <text>Roamers at heart, centaurs love open spaces and the freedom to travel. As much as they can, centaurs run. They race the wind, hooves thundering and tails streaming behind them.

In the sprawling city of Ravnica, where "open road" seems like a contradiction and "open plain" is sheer nonsense, centaurs nevertheless retain a love of wide spaces and the freedom to travel. As much as they can, centaurs run—in wide plazas, spacious parks, and expanses of rubble and ruin. They race the wind, hooves thundering and tails streaming behind them, until the next wall looms in their path and brings them to a stop.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Nature's Cavalry</name>
      <text>Centaurs have the upper bodies, down to the waist, of muscular humans, displaying all the human variety of skin tones and features. Their ears are slightly pointed, but their faces are wider and squarer than those of elves. Below the waist, they have the bodies of small horses, with a similar range of coloration—from various shades of chestnut or bay to dappled or even zebra-like striped patterns. Most centaurs style their hair and their tails in a similar way. Selesnya centaurs favor long, flowing hair. Gruul centaurs cut their hair in rough, spiky styles.
	The upper bodies of centaurs are comparable to human torsos in size, and their lower equine bodies average about 4 feet tall at the withers. Though they are smaller than a human rider mounted on a horse, they fill similar roles as cavalry warriors, messengers, outriders, and scouts.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Affinity for Nature</name>
      <text>Centaurs have an affinity for the natural world. Among the guilds that share that affinity, centaurs favor the rubblebelts of the Gruul Clans and the wide plazas of the Selesnya Conclave over the undercity tunnels of the Golgari and the laboratories of the Simic.
	Centaurs celebrate life and growth, and the birth of a foal is always cause for festivities. At the same time, they revere the traditions of the past, and among both the Gruul and the Selesnya they are voices of memory and history, preserving old ways and keeping alive the legends of ancestral heroes. They feel a close kinship with wild animals, perhaps because of their own horse-like bodies, and delight in the feeling of running alongside herds and packs of other beasts.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Clans and Community</name>
      <text>Centaurs sense the interconnectedness of the natural world. Thus, they celebrate family and community as microcosms of that greater connection. Among the Gruul, they have a strong clan identity, and Selesnya centaurs are fiercely loyal to their individual communities as well as the guild as a whole. Their love of history and tradition also means that centaurs are more likely than most other Ravnicans to join the same guild that their parents did.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Centaur Names</name>
      <text>Centaurs' given names are passed down through family lines. The name bestowed on a new foal is typically the name of the most recently deceased family member of the same gender, keeping alive the memory—and, the centaurs believe, some shard of the spirit—of the departed. Centaurs don't use family names, but they wear symbols that represent their family membership. These symbols might include graphical representations of plants or animals, printed mottoes, braids and beads worn in the hair and tail, or even specific patterns of woven fabric.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Goblins occupy an uneasy place in a dangerous world, and they react by lashing out at any creatures they believe they can bully. Cunning in battle and cruel in victory, goblins are fawning and servile in defeat, just as in their own society lower castes must scrape before those of greater status and as goblin tribes bow before other goblinoids.

Whether sniveling in fear, cackling with mad laughter, or snarling in a fury, goblins are wretched and inconsequential—at least in the eyes of most of Ravnica's other folk. In their own minds, though, they are content to lurk in the shadows only until they fully come into their own and receive the recognition they believe they deserve. They are entitled to some credit for their tenacity, agility, crafty ingenuity, and dumb luck, all of which has enabled them to survive in a world overrun with creatures larger and more powerful than they are.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Small and Wiry</name>
      <text>Standing around 3 feet tall and covered in warty green or red skin, goblins have huge noses and ears. Their wiry bodies are surprisingly strong, and their mouths are full of sharp, crooked teeth.
	Most goblins are bald, either by heredity or by choice, but a few boast shocks of red or black hair. Their arms and legs are elongated in proportion to their small bodies, and their fingers and toes are also long and slender. Many goblins prefer to go unshod to leave their toes exposed for climbing.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Unfettered Emotion</name>
      <text>Creatures of raw impulse, goblins are found among guilds that value that quality, particularly the Izzet (where they typically serve as attendants for researchers), the Gruul (in camps that form hapless buffers between the clans and civilized regions), the Rakdos (putting their love of explosions to good use), and occasionally the Boros (if they discover a well of discipline and courage within themselves, or find themselves unable to resist the shininess of Boros weapons and armor). Many goblins are guildless and make their way as members of street gangs.
	Sometimes driven by wild mood swings, goblins have an inclination toward destruction, which can take a playful form but is often anything but. Some goblins clobber things, others like to light them on fire, and many love to blow things up.
	Goblins have an outrageous sense of humor, usually expressed through mischievous pranks. The malicious among them find pleasure in the misfortune of others and tend to cackle maniacally whenever they're amused. They can act with apparent randomness, sometimes just to confuse and befuddle others.</text>

      <text>The humanoid elephants called loxodons are often oases of calm in the busy streets of Ravnica. They hum or chant in sonorous tones and move slowly or sit in perfect stillness. If provoked to action, loxodons are true terrors—bellowing with rage, trumpeting and flapping their ears. Their serene wisdom, fierce loyalty, and unwavering conviction are tremendous assets to their guilds.

As they say, "There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man."

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Lumbering Giants</name>
      <text>Loxodons tower above most other humanoids, standing over 7 feet tall. They have the heads—trunks, tusks, ears, and faces—of elephants, and hulking bipedal bodies covered by thick, leathery skin. Each of their hands has four thick digits, and their feet are the flat-bottomed, oval-shaped feet of elephants.
	Like that of an elephant, a loxodon's trunk is a useful appendage. In addition to providing a keen sense of smell, the trunk can be used to lift and carry even heavy objects. The trunk can be used to carry both food and liquid to the mouth and can even act as a snorkel.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Gifted Stoneworkers</name>
      <text>Loxodons are tireless, patient artisans with an unrivaled intuition about their craft. Although they make nurturing spiritual leaders, their gift for stonework is so ingrained that they are often at a loss when they try to impart that knowledge to others. Among the Selesnya, it primarily falls to loxodons to build the guild's magnificent, cathedral-like arboretum structures.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Relentlessly Loyal</name>
      <text>Loxodons believe in the value of community and life, and thus are most often found in the Selesnya Conclave. Some find fulfillment in the cause of order by joining the Orzhov Syndicate or the Azorius Senate.
	Loxodons believe that the members of a group have a responsibility to look out for each other. Once they have joined a guild or bonded with other individuals in any capacity, loxodons devote themselves to maintaining that bond. They coordinate their efforts and are often willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the group. They expect reciprocal loyalty and commitment from the other members of their communities and can be severe in their disappointment when their trust is betrayed.
	The primary difference between loxodons who join different guilds is their sense of the size of the community they belong to. For loxodons in the Selesnya Conclave, their community is the world and all living beings in it—everything valuable, meant to live in harmony, and interdependent. For Azorius loxodons, community primarily means a society of different peoples who need adherence to law and order so they can function together. For those in the Orzhov Syndicate, community means the syndicate alone, with its interests taking priority over those of any other group.</text>

      <name>Loxodon Names</name>
      <text>A loxodon's name includes subtle tones, produced in a loxodon's resonant nasal chambers, that indicate status, family connection, and community role. Since most non-loxodons can't distinguish these underlying tones, let alone produce them, loxodons often translate them into titles, such as Hierarch, Revered, Grandmother, Healer, or Saint, when interacting with other races.

	Manes of shaggy fur extend down minotaurs' necks and powerful backs, and males have long tufts of hair on their chins and cheeks. Their legs end in heavy, cloven hooves. Minotaurs are born with long, tufted tails, but minotaurs of the Ordruun clan (and some others) have their tails docked as part of a coming-of-age ceremony; they find the heavy armor of the Boros legion much more comfortable without a long tail in the way.</text>

      <text>Minotaurs are zealous and love battle. They are found among the Gruul Clans, but the minotaurs of the Ordruun family line, long associated with the Boros Legion, are much better known and respected. Boros minotaurs choose the precision of the legion over the fury of the pack.

      <text>Minotaur legends describe a small pantheon of heroes—perhaps they were once thought of as gods—who established the minotaurs' place in the world. Every minotaur in Ravnica claims descent from one of these heroes. The Ordruun line is the most prominent, with thousands of members descended from an ancient hero who is said to have taught minotaurs the arts of war. Other important family lines include the Kharran line (primarily associated with the Gruul Scab clan), the Drendaa line (found scattered among the Gruul Clans), and the Tazgral line (divided between the Boros and the Gruul, with a significant number in the Rakdos as well).
	Since each family line has so many members, minotaurs don't usually find it helpful to connect the name of the line to their personal names; even though Commander Grozdan of the Boros Legion's Kamen Fortress is a prominent member of the Ordruun line, he would never call himself Grozdan Ordruun the way a human would.</text>

      <text>The Simic Combine uses magic to fuse different life forms together. In recent years, the Simic Combine has extended this research to humanoid subjects, magically transferring the traits of various animals into humans, elves, and vedalken. The goal of the Guardian Project is to build a Simic army of soldiers perfectly adapted to a variety of combat situations. These hyper-evolved specimens are called Simic hybrids, though they sometimes refer to themselves as guardians.

      <text>A hybrid's biological enhancements can change its appearance drastically, though most hybrids retain their basic physical form.

These include crab claws, squid tentacles, wings or fins like those of manta rays, translucent or camouflaged skin, or shark-like maws filled with sharp teeth.
	Hybrids are the product of Simic magic. It's not impossible for a hybrid to leave the Simic Combine and join another guild, but the Simic would consider the individual a deserter. And the new guild might never fully welcome a hybrid who could easily be a Simic spy.</text>

	At 1st level, choose one of the following options:

	• Manta Glide: You have ray-like fins that you can use as wings to slow your fall or allow you to glide. When you fall and aren't incapacitated, you can subtract up to 100 feet from the fall when calculating falling damage, and you can move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot you descend.

	• Nimble Climber: You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

	• Underwater Adaptation: You can breathe air and water, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

At 5th level, your body evolves further, developing new characteristics. Choose one of the options you didn't take at 1st level, or one of the following options:

	• Grappling Appendage: You have two special appendages growing alongside your arms. Choose whether they're both claws or tentacles. As an action, you can use one of them to try to grapple a creature. Each one is also a natural weapon, which you can use to make an unarmed strike. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action. These appendages can't precisely manipulate anything and can't wield weapons, magic items, or other specialized equipment.

	• Carapace: Your skin in places is covered by a thick shell. You gain a +1 bonus to AC when you're not wearing heavy armor.

	• Acid Spit: As an action, you can spray acid from glands in your mouth, targeting one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of you. The target takes 2d10 acid damage unless it succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 11th level (3d10) and 17th level (4d10).

      <name>Ongoing Mutations</name>
      <text>Because the verdan have not dwelled long in the world, they are still discovering new things about themselves. Chief among these discoveries is that their physical forms change as they age, signifying that the mutative power of That-Which-Endures is not done with them. The first verdan emerged from the Underdark as creatures of goblin stature. But they soon learned that their kind were fated to eventually undergo a dramatic, painful, and random growth spurt that sees them transformed to hobgoblin size over a period ofdays.
	At the same time, many verdan undergo changes in coloring as they age. Male verdan typically have little to no hair, while females sport shocks of wiry hair that they try to tame in a variety ofstyles. But the color of any verdan's hair, skin. and eyes can transform from their original jade tones to pale white, deep ebon, or any other shade in between. A verdan's ears also undergo numerous spontaneous alterations over their lifetime, from the typical range of point and peak seen among the elves, to huge ears that sweep back from the head like wings. and which are often pierced behind the head with a single ring to keep them from flapping about.
	Changes in gender are also a known and accepted part of verdan life. These fluid aspects of form and identity are seen as blessings, allowing an individual to experience more of the world and grow in empathy and understanding. There is no pattern to any verdan's mutations, as verdan from the same family can shift in drastically different ways. The verdan assign no cultural or biological relevance to any particular coloration. physical features, or gender.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Cultural Chameleons</name>
      <text>The clan homes of the Underdark goblinoids who became the verdan covered an enormous area. As the verdan fled to the surface world, they emerged in culturally diverse locations. Some found themselves near dwarven strongholds. others near elven enclaves, and others near the widespread human settlements of Faerûn.
	Without a cultural identity or memory of their own. the verdan quickly adopted the cultural practices of the areas into which they migrated. Still, a sense of not truly belonging is felt even by verdan who have been welcomed into other cultures. They are often stricken with wanderlust, keeping their possessions limited and easily portable. It is not unusual to see individual verdan or whole families trooping along the roads of the world with their tents and belongings strapped to their backs.
	Even when they are happily steeped in a culture, the verdan remain on the lookout for oppression and curtailment of freedoms. They understand the need for laws that protect, but they rail against laws that restrict and oppress-especially those designed to protect the power and wealth of the elite. When Jiving among enlightened folk, verdan are still the first to speak out against cultural restraints on individuals, particularly those based on physical characteristics such as gender, race, or appearance.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Wide-Eyed and Curious</name>
      <text>Verdan are hungry to undertake new challenges and absorb new experiences. When they meet other verdan who have traveled to different parts of the world, they drop everything to spend as long as possible sharing stories and observations from their respective travels. However, their inexperience in the world and their racial amnesia sometimes lends the verdan a kind of innocence that works against them. Some are credulous and easily fooled by hucksters, but most verdan have an intuition bred by empathy that helps them eventually sort out those who are sincere from those who are not.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Verdan Names</name>
      <text>he oldest verdan names spring from goblinoid traditions. but more recent names reflect the character of the different cultures these folk have encountered since coming out into the sunlight. When a group ofverdan live near dwarves, they might take on more dwarven-sounding names, only to change those names when they wander into a human area. A verdan is also not hesitant to change their name as their physical appearance changes-or, indeed, whenever the mood strikes them.
	Verdan make no differentiation between male, female, and family names, and often eschew family names altogether.

      <name>Age</name>
      <text>Verdan reach adulthood at around the age of 24, and it is thought that they might live to nearly 200 years old. However, because no verdan has died of old age since the race's initial creation, their upper age limits remain subject to speculation.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>

      <name>Dwarves and Dragonmarks</name>
      <text>The Mark of Warding appears on dwarves of House Kundarak, which had its origins as one of the clans of the Mror Holds. Kundarak dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.
	In addition to providing all manner of security, House Kundarak dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.</text>

      <text>Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

To set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size modifier:

Size modifier = 2d10
Height = 4 feet + 6 inches + your size modifier in inches
Weight in pounds = 90 + (1d4 × your size modifier)</text>

      <name>Trance</name>
      <text>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed.</text>

      <text>The Mark of Scribing appears among the gnomes of House Sivis. The gnomes of this house were among the first of their kind to leave Zilargo and live in human lands.

Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.

A halfling with the Mark of Healing can save a life with a touch, restoring vitality and the will to live. When dealing with mundane medicine, the mark helps its bearer sense the nature of maladies, aiding them in finding a cure. When equipped with dragonshard focus items, the mark can even draw the dead back from the depths of Dolurrh.

      <name>Halflings and Dragonmarks</name>
      <text>Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the Mark of Healing in House Jorasco and House Ghallanda's Mark of Hospitality. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of Aerenal received their first marks-centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of House Ghallanda joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.
	With its powers related to food and shelter, the Mark of Hospitality was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows House Ghallanda to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the Mark of Healing has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and House Jorasco still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.</text>

The Mark of Finding sharpens the senses, guiding the hunter to prey. Alone among the dragonmarks, the Mark of Finding is carried by two races: humans and halforcs. It first appeared in the Shadow Marches, where clan hunters used it to find their prey.

      <name>Humans and Dragonmarks</name>
      <text>Five different dragonmarks appear among humans, reflecting their dominant status among the races of Khorvaire:

	• The Mark of Making is found in House Cannith, which has used it to become one of the most powerful houses, creating an abundance of both magical and technological wonders.

	• The Mark of Passage aids the humans of House Orien in operating the lightning rail and trade caravans running across the continent.

	• The Mark of Sentinel makes the bodyguards, mercenaries, and Sentinel Marshals of House Deneith widely respected across Khorvaire.

	• The Mark of Handling appears in House Vada lis, which uses it to breed fine mounts and other creatures.

Humans also number among House Tharashk and manifest the Mark of Finding with their half-ore kin.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The kalashtar are a compound race created from the union of humanity and renegade spirits from the plane of dreams — spirits called quori. Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. But there is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.

    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Bound to Spirits</name>
      <text>Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but the spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features. The eyes of a kalashtar often glow when it is focused on a task or feeling strong emotions.
	The kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. A kalashtar might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature of the linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but for some | for instance, an orphan kalashtar raised among outsiders | may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts.
	The bond to the spirit can cause some kalashtar to display unusual quirks of behavior. You can roll or select a trait from the following table.

Kalashtar Quirks:
d10 | Quirk
1 | You try to understand the motives and feelings of your enemies.
2 | You prefer using telepathy over speaking aloud.
3 | You feel a strong drive to protect the innocent.
4 | You apply dream logic to mundane situations.
5 | You discuss things out loud with your quori spirit.
6 | You suppress your emotions and rely on logic.
7 | You are strongly influenced by the emotions of those around you.
8 | You prefer to find nonviolent solutions to problems whenever possible.
9 | You are driven by a warrior spirit and will fight for any noble cause.
10 | You are obsessed with Dreaming Dark conspiracies.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Hunted by Nightmares</name>
      <text>The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar fled from the dream-realm of Dal Quor to escape evil spirits that dom inate it. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can change the fundamental nature of Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans for Eberron. Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters manipulate the folk of Khorvaire to eliminate kalashtar whenever possible.
	Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dream ing Dark by focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. Others, though, seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or protect the innocent however they can. Still other kalashtar grow up isolated, knowing nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans might use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Kalashtar Names</name>
      <text>A kalashtar name adds a personal prefix to the name of the quori spirit within the kalashtar. Such names have no relation to the kalashtar's gender.
	Kalashtar orphans are unlikely to know the name of their spirit and take names from another source.

Quori Names: Ashana, Ashtai, Ishara, Hareth, Khad, Kosh, Melk, Nari, Tana, Tari, Tash, Ulad, Vakri, Vash Kalashtar Names: Coratash, Dalavash, Dolishara, Ha lakosh, Khoratari, Koratana, Lanhareth, Molavakri, Nevitash, Sorashana, Torashtai, Valakhad, Vishara</text>

	When you're using this trait to speak telepathically to a creature, you can use your action to give that creature the ability to speak telepathically with you for 1 hour or until you end this effect as an action.

For no matter how thick its walls, skilled its archers, or brave its knights, few settlements have ever withstood a full-scale onslaught of orcs.
	Every soldier who lives through a fight with orcs tells of confronting a hulking foe that can cleave through a warrior with a single blow, part of a force that can cut down enemies as though they were trembling stalks of wheat before the scythe. Only a skilled and determined hero can hope to survive single combat with an orc.
	Savage and fearless, orc tribes are ever in search of elves, dwarves, and humans to destroy. Motivated by their hatred of the civilized races of the world and their need to satisfy the demands of their deities, the orcs know that if they fight well and bring glory to their tribe, Gruumsh will call them home to the plane of Acheron. It is there in the afterlife where the chosen ones will join Gruumsh and his armies in their endless extraplanar battle for supremacy.

      <text>Shifters are sometimes called the weretouched, as many believe that they are the descendants of humans and lycanthropes. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they cannot fully change shape they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features — a state they call shifting. Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. A shifter walks on the knife's edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?

Stoic and solid, a beasthide shifter draws strength and stability from the beast within. Beasthide shifters are typically tied to the bear or the boar, but this subrace could embody any creature known for its toughness.

    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>The Beast Within</name>
      <text>Early in childhood, a shifter forms a bond with a beast within, a totemic force that shapes their body and mind. Some shifters believe that these spirits are indepen dent entities, and they may speak of Bear or Wolf as ancestors or guides. Most just see the beast within as a formidable expression of their inner nature, something that emerges as the shifter's personality takes shape. The beast within is a pool of powerful instincts, and its influence is revealed by a shifter's personality: a feline shifter may be cool and distant, driven by predatory instincts, while a shifter with a lupine spirit might be drawn to find and protect a pack. When a shifter fully embraces this beast within they physically transform for a short time.
	A shifter's beast within is reflected by the shifter's sub race. Four subraces are especially common:

	• Beasthide often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stub born, and thick-skinned.

	• Longtooth shifters typically have lupine traits and pre fer to run with a pack.

	• Swiftstride are often predatory and feline, but a swift stride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows.

	• Wildhunt shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey.

While the beast within certainly has a physical impact on a shifter, it has a spiritual and psychological effect, as well. Two beasthide shifters share the same special ability, but if one has the aspect of the boar and the other is more like a bear, they'll be quite different in personality. With any shifter, identifying the beast within is a crucial part of understanding the character.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Similar and Diverse</name>
      <text>Shifters are similar to humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes, flat noses, and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies.
	The traits of the beast within affect a shifter's appearance as well. A swiftstride shifter may have catlike eyes and delicate build, while a beasthide shifter might be a massive brute built like a bear. While a shifter's appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>The Journey Yet to Come</name>
      <text>Shifters have a strong presence in the Eldeen Reaches but can be found in rural areas across Khorvaire, where they often live among humans. While they form powerful bonds to friends and kin, shifters place great value on self-reliance and freedom. It's a shifter proverb to "always be prepared for the journey yet to come," and most shifters strive to be ready for change or opportunity.

      <text>Shifters are sometimes called the weretouched, as many believe that they are the descendants of humans and lycanthropes. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they cannot fully change shape they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features — a state they call shifting. Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. A shifter walks on the knife's edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?

Longtooth shifters are fierce and aggressive, but they form deep bonds with their friends. Many longtooth shifters have canine traits that become more pronounced as they shift, but they might instead draw on tigers, hyenas, or other predators.

      <name>The Beast Within</name>
      <text>Early in childhood, a shifter forms a bond with a beast within, a totemic force that shapes their body and mind. Some shifters believe that these spirits are indepen dent entities, and they may speak of Bear or Wolf as ancestors or guides. Most just see the beast within as a formidable expression of their inner nature, something that emerges as the shifter's personality takes shape. The beast within is a pool of powerful instincts, and its influence is revealed by a shifter's personality: a feline shifter may be cool and distant, driven by predatory instincts, while a shifter with a lupine spirit might be drawn to find and protect a pack. When a shifter fully embraces this beast within they physically transform for a short time.
	A shifter's beast within is reflected by the shifter's sub race. Four subraces are especially common:

	• Beasthide often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stub born, and thick-skinned.

	• Longtooth shifters typically have lupine traits and pre fer to run with a pack.

	• Swiftstride are often predatory and feline, but a swift stride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows.

	• Wildhunt shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey.

While the beast within certainly has a physical impact on a shifter, it has a spiritual and psychological effect, as well. Two beasthide shifters share the same special ability, but if one has the aspect of the boar and the other is more like a bear, they'll be quite different in personality. With any shifter, identifying the beast within is a crucial part of understanding the character.</text>

      <text>The warforged were built to fight in the Last War. The first warforged were mindless automatons, but House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced fully sentient soldiers, blending organic and inorganic materials. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond the war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killing machine, or a visionary in search of purpose and meaning.

      <name>Living Steel and Stone</name>
      <text>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a frame work of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.
	Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids.</text>

      <name>Warforged Personality</name>
      <text>The warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them.
	The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose-such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land-and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.
	The typical warforged has a sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity. The more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Powerful and curious, quick to act and knowledgeable of the wider world, centaurs seek to experience life's boundless bounty. The centaurs of Theros are divided into two groups: members of the far-traveling Lagonna band and the proud raiders of the Pheres band. These bands occupy territories situated between the three major human poleis, making them common sights to those who travel human lands. Not ones to settle in permanent homes, though, centaurs might be found wherever there are wonders to be witnessed and adventures to be had.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Markings of the Herd</name>
      <text>Though centaurs share the same basic physiology, the centaur bands are commonly associated with their own distinct traits.
	Lagonna band centaurs tend to be sleek and muscular, with powerful legs built for endurance rather than speed. They usually have coats of a single color, often with a shine that can look metallic in bright light.
	Pheres band centaurs typically have long, nimble legs and lean bodies, and are often marked with natural color patterns on their hide. Pheres centaurs sometimes paint or tattoo their upper bodies to match the patterns on their lower half. Occasionally, a Pheres centaur is born with vertical stripes on their hooves, foretelling an exciting and adventurous life.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Lagonna Merchant Families</name>
      <text>Lagonna centaurs travel in small merchant family bands called guri. These groups frequently trade with Meletis, which provides the biggest market for their wares, but they also do business with Setessa and smaller communities within Akros's lands.
The eldest member of each guros typically leads their family. In times of discord, the heads of the guri gather to make decisions together. Other members of the guros work as traders, gatherers, packers, and scouts. A guros has several specialized roles required for success in travel and trade: a barterer, an omener, a courser, and preferably a koletra.
	A barterer negotiates deals between the guros and other traders. Barterers must know the customs of other cultures and speak several different languages.
	An omener is an oracle who reads messages from the gods in the natural world and reveals how the immortals would have the guros travel.
	A courser explores new trade territory for their guros. They are expert trackers and navigators, able to venture deep into unexplored territory and unerringly return to their families.
	Finally, every guros tries to travel with at least one koletra, one of the mighty, well-trained warriors of the Lagonna who are said to have the blood of the first, legendary centaur heroes. Koletras are said to bring good luck to a band, but are also usually fated to die in defense of their family. Not every guros has a koletra of its own, and guri share their best warriors among each other as a sign of goodwill and a way to forge bonds.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Journeys of Discovery</name>
      <text>When young Lagonna centaurs become adults, they often leave their band to travel the world on their own. This time of self-discovery, called a protoporos, can last anywhere from a few weeks to several years. The Lagonna believe that a protoporos helps young centaurs find their place in the world. An omener reads the signs of fortune before sending young centaurs on their way, guiding the first steps of their journey. While most centaurs return to the band eventually, some find their calling elsewhere. When the Lagonna tell tales of their greatest heroes, they often speak of centaurs who found their heroic destiny on a protoporos.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Pheres Raiders</name>
      <text>The Pheres roam the wild lands between Setessa and Akros in small raiding herds. These herds are voluntary associations, in contrast to the family groups of the Lagonna. When necessary, several small bands join together in a larger herd to target particularly dangerous but resource-rich targets—be they humanoid traders or roving, greedy monsters. Bands also join together to defeat common threats or to hunt for game.
	The Pheres value physical strength, speed, and prowess in both hunting and combat. Often a band is led by the strongest and most dominant warrior, called the charger. However, some bands elevate a tactician or strategist to this venerated position. The Pheres can be brutal and greedy, but they are clever as well, and understand the value of strategic leadership.
	Other centaurs in Pheres herds work as scouts, archers, warriors, and foragers. In addition, most Pheres herds contain a caller and a tromper.
	Pheres callers are typically druids or rangers who can draw animal assistance to their herd. Callers often have one or more animal allies at their side, and can speak to animals to learn about the surrounding lands.
	Trompers are the most powerful and feared warriors of the herd. Centaur legends say that when the gods first fashioned humans from the red mud of the eldest river, Pheres trompers taught them how to corner and kill prey. The story tells that, to repay this debt, humans owe the centaurs a portion of what they catch. While humans don't recall this arrangement, the Pheres often cite it as justification for their raids.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Pheres Renegades</name>
      <text>Pheres band members survive by working and fighting together, but still some centaurs choose to strike out on their own. These renegades often feel like outsiders in their own band. They might be pacifists, wishing to learn about other people rather than fighting them. Or they might feel a restlessness in their soul that nothing else can soothe. Though renegades build their own life away from the band, most retain some connection with their past. Some stories tell of renegades returning to help their band in times of need before disappearing once more.</text>

Prides of these nomadic, lion-like humanoids rarely interact with other peoples, having all they need in their shimmering homeland and knowing the treachery of strangers. Still, some leonin wonder what lies beyond Oreskos's border mountains and seek to test themselves in a wider world.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Noble and Fierce</name>
      <text>Leonin tend to be tall compared to humans and move with a boldness that suggests their physical might. Tawny fur covers leonin bodies, and some grow thick manes ranging in shades from gold to black. While their hands prove as nimble as those of other humanoids, leonin have retractable feline claws, which they can extend instantly. This, along with their ability to produce bone-shaking roars, gives most leonin an air that readily shifts between regal and fearsome.
	Leonin often act with confidence, which can come off as imperiousness. While this can reassure their allies, it can also suggest defiance in the face of what they perceive as imposed authority or unworthy experts.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Quick to Quarrel</name>
      <text>Other peoples often perceive leonin as quick to take offense, intolerant of criticism, or belligerent. The truth is that many leonin simply enjoy fighting, whether verbal or physical. They take pleasure in argument, wrestling, sparring, and even battle, en joying the opportunity to exercise their minds and bodies.
	It follows, too, that leonin aren't inclined to carry grudges. A warrior might react with sudden violence to an insult, but when the fight is over (and the leonin's superiority proven), the insult is forgotten-along with the vanquished foe.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Pride and Self-Reliance</name>
      <text>Few leonin devote themselves to the service of the gods. Centuries ago, the leonin worshiped the same gods that humans do, but after many of their prides suffered depravities at the hands of the tyrant Agnomakhos, most leonin rejected the gods. It's not that they deny the existence of deities; they merely see the gods as mercurial and ultimately unworthy of adoration. The Leonin and the Gods table suggests the range of attitudes that leonin might adopt toward the gods.
	Leonin rely on themselves and their prides. A pride is bound together by the experience of a shared challenge and, in particular, the sacred act of the hunt. See chapter 3 for more details on Oreskos and the leonin who call that land home.

Leonin and the Gods
d6 | Attitude
1 | I'm amused by the antics of the gods and their earnest, but ultimately deluded, mortal champions, and I feel smugly superior in my detachment.
2 | The meddling of the gods in mortal affairs makes me angry and bitter. I wish they would just leave us all alone!
3 | I view the gods as worthy adversaries—incredibly clever and well-prepared to play a long game but ultimately doomed to lose their games.
4 | I'm certain every bad thing that happens can ultimately be blamed on the gods, but I roll my eyes at each new twist of fate and try to get on with my life.
5 | I wish that I could be as naive as humans and other mortals who actually think the gods are looking out for them. I miss that kind of innocence.
6 | I don't talk about it among other leonin, but I actually revere the gods and try to please them by my actions.</text>

      <text>Minotaurs are barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling those of bulls. Their horns range in size from about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three times that length. Theros minotaurs often carve their horns to sharpen their edges, etch symbols of power into them, or sheathe them in bronze to prevent them from shattering during battle.
	Thick hair extends down minotaurs' necks and powerful backs, and some have long patches of hair on their chins and cheeks. Their legs end in heavy, cloven hooves, and they have long, tufted tails. Minotaur priests often adorn themselves with sacred items, be they trophies from fallen foes, keepsakes from their homeland, or naturally occurring marks of their god's favor.</text>

      <text>Although minotaurs aren't evil by nature and are free to worship any god, many are raised among those devoted to Mogis's vile whims. Myths tell that Mogis created the first minotaurs from his own followers, typically criminals and monsters of unspeakable depravity. While many groups of minotaurs still honor their villainous progenitors, others have abandoned their ancestors and moved beyond their crimes, seeking their fates in the future, not the past.
	While the inhabitants of Akros and other reaches near Phoberos, the homeland of most minotaur herds, have engaged in endless conflicts with bloodthirsty minotaurs, they know there are those who forsake Mogis's depravities. The people of Meletis, Setessa, and lands beyond are also generally open-minded and curious about minotaurs who wander into their lands. Epics like The Callapheia also describe multiple heroic minotaurs. As a result, a minotaur traveling in the company of other non-minotaurs is likely to be accepted in any polis.</text>

      <text>In their physical forms, satyrs embody a fusion of humanoid civilization with the freedom of wild beasts. Generally, they look similar to humans, with a range of builds and features. But their goatlike horns, pointed ears, and furred lower bodies sharply distinguish them. Satyrs' solid horns connect to their heads at the base of their skulls, while their legs end in sturdy hooves. Thick fur covers their bodies from the waist down, shorter at the waist and longer below the knees. Short, soft hair grows down their neck and spine, along their shoulders, and on their forearms.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Embracing Life</name>
      <text>Most satyrs believe that the other peoples of Theros are woefully burdened with the plague of seriousness. Satyrs scoff at the efforts of polis-builders with their laws and right angles, and they poke fun at philosophers with their endless theories and interminable discourse. Satyrs feel that life is to be lived and experienced with all the senses. Satyrs see the world and everything in it as a book of delights, and they want to explore every page. See chapter 3 for more details on the satyr homeland, the Skola Vale.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>The Art of the Revel</name>
      <text>The humans of the poleis generally think of satyrs' revels as raucous bacchanals, where anything and everything might happen. This picture isn't wrong, but it's incomplete: there's more to a revel than debauchery. For satyrs, revelry is a way of life. It's the delight in small things: the song of a bird, a warm breeze, the smell of a tasty pie, relaxing by a river in the sunshine. Life freely offers these gifts, and for a satyr, they are more valuable than gold or glory. To revel means to forget the constraints of time, to let go of the future and past, and to be wholly in the present moment. For satyrs, encountering life with all the senses honors the gods, and—most importantly—it feels really good. Driven by instinct and intuition, most satyrs prove unpredictable, following their sense of wonder wherever it leads.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Very Odd Indeed</name>
      <text>Satyrs are known for their eccentricities. Some people spend too much time worrying over why satyrs behave as they do. But satyrs themselves simply are as they are, feeling no need to understand what drives them, much less explain it to others. The Satyr Eccentricities table suggests a few tastes or proclivities your satyr character might possess.

Satyr Eccentricities:
d8 | Characteristic
1 | Flowers are the most amazing things ever. I want to pick them, wear them, and discover their silent secrets.
2 | There isn't a tree or statue that isn't fun to climb.
3 | Nothing wards off bad luck like a jolly dance.
4 | Sometimes talking to a plant really helps.
5 | If stumped, I smoke a pipe. And if I'm going to smoke a pipe, it's going to be a splendid pipe.
6 | I imagine that my clothes are my glorious soul on display for all the world to behold, and I dress accordingly.
7 | Having horns is the best. They are fun to decorate, and they can pop open an amphora, no problem.
8 | If I have something really important to say, I always make sure to sing it.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Tritons dwell throughout the Siren Sea, exploring a world of coral forests and secret mountains the "dryfolk" of the surface world will never know. While most live their entire lives beneath the sea, they're not bound to the deep. Following their inherent curiosity, some tritons venture beyond the waves, seeking to explore a whole world of wonders beyond their own.

Source:	Mythic Odysseys of Theros p. 26</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Born of the Sea</name>
      <text>Tritons are an amphibious people, at home in the water but mobile on dry land. Their bodies are covered in fine scales that range from yellowish-green through shades of blue to deep purple. Their heads are crowned with prominent crests, and fins sprout from their forearms, calves, and shoulders. Their digits are webbed, allowing them to swim as quickly as they can run.
	Well suited to life in the deep, tritons wear little clothing unless armored for battle. They fashion most of their clothes and other items from materials found in the ocean: coral, seaweed, shells, bone, sea urchin spines, the shells of monstrous crustaceans, and so on. Having an old, well-developed civilization, tritons know much of how to refine these materials into garb as rich and weapons as sturdy as any found on land.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Land and Sea</name>
      <text>For centuries, dryfolk have fished the seas of Theros and have used the sea's surface as a means of travel. Many tritons interpret this as an intrusion into their domains. As a result, some warlike triton communities respond with periodic strikes against sailors and fishing vessels. Others believe that turnabout is fair play and so venture onto land to hunt for meat, steal supplies from coastal travelers, or raid dryfolk poleis for riches.
	Despite the tensions between tritons and the peoples of the surface, some tritons make their lives on land. Enchanted by the feeling of the winds, the rustle of leaves, the ingenuity of land-dwelling inventors, or any of countless other surface-world charms, every triton living beyond the waves does so for their own reasons. In some places, like the polis of Meletis, whole triton communities flourish among dryfolk neighbors. See chapter 3 for more details on the tritons of Meletis and the Siren Sea.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Hand of Thassa</name>
      <text>While tritons pay respects to many gods, they tend to revere Thassa, god of the sea, above all other deities. Her devotees see her as the primary god of the pantheon, believing she will bring their people to ascendancy over the monsters of the sea and the poleis of the land.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Depths of Curiosity</name>
      <text>Many tritons are intrigued by surface culture. The curious among them venture into sunken ruins and shipwrecks, sifting through the debris for whatever grabs their attention. Often these tritons develop collections of a specific kind of object or lore, trading with one another as they develop a sort of expertise in their field. Some tritons approach investigations of the dryfolk with scientific rigor. Such scholars often hold theories to go along with their collections, hypotheses many are eager to test upon meeting new dryfolk.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Triton Names</name>
      <text>A triton's name is a symbol of choice. Upon reaching adulthood, a triton might shed the name they were given by their parents for one of their own choosing. Some opt to keep their name, but the majority select one that represents the adult they've become. Tritons might even go on to choose yet other names, as they shift from one phase of life to another, or after significant life events. Leaving a home community or transitioning to live among dryfolk might constitute such life changes. Tritons also have a fluid concept of gender and might switch names freely as they shift gender identities.

Female Names: Amathe, Gnorcys, Leurybia, Margomestra, Nereones, Oleia, Samathe, Saphiro, Tethene, Theaneia, Thectra

Male Names: Bysseus, Cetos, Galaukus, Galiton, Kenessos, Odexes, Palamon, Pontreus, Rheteus, Thrasios</text>

	With unique insights into the nature of the undead, many dhampirs become adventurers and monster hunters. Their reasons are often deeply personal. Some seek danger, imagining monsters as personifications of their own hungers. Others pursue revenge against whatever turned them into a dhampir. And still others embrace the solitude of the hunt, striving to distance themselves from those who'd tempt their hunger.

Darkon. The Kargat, this shattered domain's secret police, supposedly know the secret of immortality. Perhaps you joined and advanced through their lesser ranks, known as the Kargatane, and were rewarded by being transformed into a dhampir.

I'Cath. At night, the starving city of I'Cath is overrun by vampiric jiangshi (described in chapter 5). You were left with a cold hunger after an encounter with one of these unquiet ancestors.</text>

      <text>Where wishing fails, ancient magic can offer a heart's desire—at least, for a time. Hexbloods are individuals infused with eldritch magic, fey energy, or mysterious witchcraft. Some who enter into bargains with hags gain their deepest wishes but eventually find themselves transformed. These changes evidence a hag's influence: ears that split in forked points, skin in lurid shades, long hair that regrows if cut, and an irremovable living crown. Along with these marks, hexbloods manifest hag-like traits, such as darkvision and a variety of magical methods to beguile the senses and avoid the same.
	While many hexbloods gain their lineage after making a deal with a hag, others reveal their nature as they age—particularly if a hag influenced them early in life or even before their birth. Many hexbloods turn to lives of adventure, seeking to discover the mysteries of their magic, to forge a connection with their fey natures, or to avoid a hag that obsesses over them.

      <text>Death isn't always the end. The reborn exemplify this, being individuals who have died yet, somehow, still live. Some reborn exhibit the scars of fatal ends, their ashen flesh or bloodless veins making it clear that they've been touched by death. Other reborn are marvels of magic or science, being stitched together from disparate beings or bearing mysterious minds in manufactured bodies. Whatever their origins, reborn know a new life and seek experiences and answers all their own.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Faded Memories</name>
      <text>Reborn suffer from some manner of discontinuity, an interruption of their lives or physical state that their minds are ill equipped to deal with. Their memories of events before this interruption are often vague or absent. Occasionally, the most unexpected experiences might cause sensations or visions of the past to come rushing back.
	Rather than sleeping, reborn regularly sit and dwell on the past, hoping for some revelation of what came before. Most of the time, these are dark, silent stretches. Occasionally, though, in a moment of peace, stress, or excitement, a reborn gains a glimpse of what came before. When you desire to have such a dreamlike vision, roll on the Lost Memories table to inspire its details.

Lost Memories:
d6 | Memory
1 | You recall a physically painful moment. What mark or scar on your body does it relate to?
2 | A memory brings tears to your eyes. Is it a bitter or cheerful memory? Does recalling it make you feel the same way?
3 | You recall a childhood memory. What about that event or who you were still influences you?
4 | A memory brings with it the voice of someone once close to you. How do they advise you?
5 | You recall enjoying something that you can't stand doing now. What is it? Why don't you like it now?
6 | A memory carries a vivid smell or sensation. What are you going to do to recreate that experience?</text>

Reborn Origins:

1 | You were magically resurrected, but something went wrong.
2 | Stitches bind your body's mismatched pieces, and your memories come from multiple different lives.
3 | After clawing free from your grave, you realized you have no memories except for a single name.
4 | You were a necromancer's undead servant for years. One day, your consciousness returned.
5 | You awoke in an abandoned laboratory alongside complex designs for clockwork organs.
6 | You were released after being petrified for generations. Your memories have faded, though, and your body isn't what it once was.
7 | Your body hosts a possessing spirit that shares its memories and replaces your missing appendages with phantasmal limbs.
8 | In public, you pass as an unremarkable individual, but you can feel the itchy straw stuffing inside you.</text>

      <text>Distant kin of giant owls from the Feywild, owlin come in many shapes and sizes, from petite and fluffy to wide-winged and majestic. Owlin have arms and legs like other Humanoids, as well as wings that extend from their back and shoulders.
	Like owls, owlin are graced with feathers that make no sound when they move or fly, making it easy for them to sneak up on you in the library.
	Your owlin character might be nocturnal. Or perhaps your character is simply prone to rise later, embodying the common nickname of night owl.

      <text>A winged people who originated on the Elemental Plane of Air, aarakocra soar through the sky wherever they wander. The first aarakocra served the Wind Dukes of Aaqa—mighty beings of air—and were imbued with a measure of their masters' power over winds. Their descendants still command echoes of that power.
	From below, aarakocra look like large birds and thus are sometimes called birdfolk. Only when they roost on a branch or walk across the ground is their Humanoid nature clear. Standing upright, aarakocra are typically about 5 feet tall, and they have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons. Feathers cover their bodies—usually red, orange, yellow, brown, or gray. Their heads are also avian, often resembling those of parrots or eagles.

      <text>Neither bugs nor bears, bugbears are the hulking cousins of goblins and hobgoblins. With roots in the Feywild, early bugbears resided in hidden places, in hard-to-reach and shadowed spaces. Long ago and from out of the corner of your eye, they came to the Material Plane, urged to spread throughout the multiverse by the conquering god Maglubiyet. Centuries later, they still bear a fey gift for lurking just out of sight, and many of them have sneaked away from that god's influence.
	They are long of limb and covered in coarse hair, with wedge-shaped ears and pointed teeth. Despite their formidable build, bugbears are quiet skulkers, thanks to a fey magic that allows them to hide in spaces seemingly too small for them.

      <text>With ever-changing appearances, changelings reside in many societies undetected. Each changeling can supernaturally adopt any face they like. For some changelings, a new face is only a disguise. For other changelings, a new face may reveal an aspect of their soul.
	The first changelings in the multiverse appeared in the Feywild, and the wondrous, mutable essence of that plane lingers in changelings today—even in those changelings who have never set foot in the fey realm. Each changeling decides how to use their shape-shifting ability, channeling either the peril or the joy of the Feywild. Sometimes they adopt new forms for the sake of mischief or malice, and other times they don a new identity to right wrongs or delight the downtrodden.
	In their true form, changelings appear faded, their features almost devoid of detail. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shape—one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history—is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth, crafting whole personas complete with histories and beliefs. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.
	Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; a community might be home to three healer changelings, with whoever is on duty adopting the persona of Andrea, the gentle physician. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.

      <text>Duergar are dwarves whose ancestors were transformed by centuries living in the deepest places of the Underdark. That chthonic realm is saturated with strange magical energy, and over generations, early duergar absorbed traces of it. They were further altered when mind flayers and other Aberrations invaded and performed horrific experiments on them. Fueled by Underdark magic, those experiments left early duergar with psionic powers, which have been passed down to their descendants. In time, they liberated themselves from their aberrant tyrants and forged a new life for themselves in the Underdark and beyond.

      <text>Eladrin are elves of the Feywild, a realm of perilous beauty and boundless magic. Using that magic, eladrin can step from one place to another in the blink of an eye, and each eladrin resonates with emotions captured in the Feywild in the form of seasons—affinities that affect the eladrin's mood and appearance. An eladrin's season can change, though some remain in one season forever. Choose your season or roll on the Eladrin Seasons table. Your Trance trait lets you change your season.

Eladrin Seasons:
d4 | Season
1 | Autumn. peace and goodwill, when summer's harvest is shared with all
2 | Winter. contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers
3 | Spring. cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment and hope as winter's sorrow passes
4 | Summer. boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy and calls to action

For your fairy, roll on the Fey Characteristics table or choose an option from it. You're also free to come up with your own characteristic if none of the suggestions below fit your character.

Fey Characteristics:
d8 | Characteristic
1 | Your wings are like those of a bird.
2 | You have shimmering, multicolored skin.
3 | You have exceptionally large ears.
4 | A glittering mist constantly surrounds you.
5 | You have a small spectral horn on your forehead, like a little unicorn horn.

      <text>Distant cousins of giants, the first firbolgs wandered the primeval forests of the multiverse, and the magic of those forests entwined itself with the firbolgs' souls. Centuries later, that magic still thrums inside a firbolg, even one who has never lived under the boughs of a great forest.
	A firbolg's magic is an obscuring sort, which allowed their ancestors to pass through a forest without disturbing it. So deep is the connection between a firbolg and the wild places of the world that they can communicate with flora and fauna.

	Air genasi's skin tones include many shades of blue, along with the full range of human skin tones, with bluish or ashen casts. Sometimes their skin is marked by lines that seem like cracks with bluish-white energy spilling out. An air genasi's hair might blow in a phantom wind or be made entirely of clouds or vapor.

      <text>Tracing their ancestry to the genies of the Elemental Planes, each genasi can tap into the power of one of the elements. Air, earth, fire, and water-these are the four pillars of the Material Plane and the four types of genasi. Some genasi are direct descendants of a genie, while others were born to non-genasi parents who lived near a place suffused by a genie's magic.

Descended from efreet, the genies of the Elemental Plane of Fire, fire genasi channel the flamboyant and often destructive nature of flame. They show their heritage in their skin tones, which can range from deep charcoal to shades of red and orange. Some bear skin tones common to humanity but with fiery marks, such as slowly swirling lights under their skin that resemble embers or glowing red lines tracing over their bodies like cracks. Fire genasi hair can resemble threads of fire or sooty smoke.

Water genasi descend from marids, aquatic genies from the Elemental Plane of Water. Water genasi are perfectly suited to life underwater and carry the power of the waves inside themselves.
	Their skin is often shades of blue or green, sometimes a blend of the two. If they have a human skin tone, there is a glistening texture that catches the light, like water droplets or nearly invisible fish scales. Their hair can resemble seaweed, waving as if in a current, or it can even be like water itself.

In that timeless, silvery realm, githyanki honed their psionic powers and built a great city called Tu'narath. They have since spread throughout the multiverse, starting in outposts outside the Astral Plane, called creches, where time passes and their children can reach adulthood.
	A lanky people with skin tones of yellows, greens, and browns, githyanki complement their physical prowess with psionic might, instilled in them by mind flayers and cultivated over eons in the Astral Plane. Now all githyanki can use their psychic bond with that plane to access splinters of knowledge left behind by beings who travel, live, and die among the silver astral clouds.
	Githyanki who reside in the Astral Plane can live indefinitely.

      <text>A subterranean folk, goblins can be found in every corner of the multiverse, often beside their bugbear and hobgoblin kin. Long before the god Maglubiyet conquered them, early goblins served in the court of the Queen of Air and Darkness, one of the Feywild's archfey. Goblins thrived in her dangerous domain thanks to a special boon from her—a supernatural knack for finding the weak spots in foes larger than themselves and for getting out of trouble. Goblins brought this fey boon with them to worlds across the Material Plane, even if they don't remember the fey realm they inhabited before Maglubiyet's rise. Now many goblins pursue their own destinies, escaping the plots of both archfey and gods.

      <text>Hobgoblins trace their origins to the ancient courts of the Feywild, where they first appeared with their goblin and bugbear kin. Many of them were driven from the Feywild by the conquering god Maglubiyet, who marshaled them as soldiers, but the fey realm left its mark; wherever they are in the multiverse, they continue to channel an aspect of the Feywild's rule of reciprocity, which creates a mystical bond between the giver and the receiver of a gift.
	On some worlds, such bonds lead hobgoblins to form communities with deep ties to one another. In Eberron and the Forgotten Realms, vast hobgoblin legions have emerged, with ranks of devoted soldiers famed for their unity.
	Hobgoblins are generally taller than their goblin cousins but not quite as big as bugbears. They have curved, pointed ears and noses that turn bright red or blue during displays of emotion.

      <text>Some of the smallest draconic creatures in the multiverse, kobolds display their draconic ancestry in the glint of their scales and in their roars. Legends tell of the first kobolds emerging from the Underdark near the lairs of the earliest dragons. In some lands, kobolds serve chromatic or metallic dragons—even worshiping them as divine beings. In other places, kobolds know too well how dangerous those dragons can be and help others defend against draconic destruction.
	Whatever their relationship to dragons, kobold scales tend to be rust colored, although the occasional kobold sports a scale color more akin to that of a chromatic or a metallic dragon. A kobold's cry can express a range of emotion: anger, resolve, elation, fear, and more. Regardless of the emotion expressed, their cry resonates with draconic power.

Because of that fact, many lizardfolk myths state that their people were placed by the gods in the Material Plane to guard its natural wonders.

	Minotaur horns range in size from about 1 foot long to easily three times that length. Minotaurs often carve their horns to sharpen their edges, etch symbols of power into them, or sheathe them in bronze to prevent them from shattering during battle.
	Thick hair extends down minotaurs' necks and powerful backs, and some have long patches of hair on their chins and cheeks. Their legs end in heavy, cloven hooves, and they have long, tufted tails.

      <text>Shifters are sometimes called weretouched, as they are descendants of people who contracted full or partial lycanthropy. Humanoids with a bestial aspect, shifters can't fully change shape, but they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features by entering a state they call shifting.
	Shifters are similar to humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies. While a shifter's appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.
	Most shifters resemble a particular kind of lycanthrope. You can choose the kind of lycanthrope in your past, or you can determine it randomly by rolling on the Lycanthrope Ancestor table. The table also provides a suggestion for the Shifting option you might have as a result of your ancestry.

Lycanthrope Ancestor
d6 | Ancestor | Suggested Shifting Option
1 | Werebear | Beasthide
2 | Wereboar | Beasthide
3 | Wererat | Swiftstride
4 | Weretiger | Swiftstride
5 | Werewolf (wolflike) | Longtooth
6 | Werewolf (doglike) | Wildhunt

      <text>Long ago, groups of elves ventured from the Feywild to the Astral Plane to be closer to their gods. Life in the Silver Void has imbued their souls with a spark of divine light. That light manifests as a starry gleam in an astral elf's eyes.
	Because nothing ages on the Astral Plane, astral elves who inhabit that plane can be very old, and their longevity gives them an unusual perspective on the passage of time. Some are prone to melancholy, while others might display an absence of feeling. Many look for creative ways to occupy themselves. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the reaches of the multiverse, astral elves tend to see things through the lens of time as having little or no meaning to them. Astral elves who don't dwell on the Astral Plane can live to be more than 750 years old.

Autognome History:

1 | Your creator gave you autonomy and urged you to follow your dreams.
2 | Your creator died, leaving you to fend for yourself.
3 | A glitch caused you to forget your original programming. You don't remember who made you or where you came from.
4 | You didn't like how you were being treated by your creator, so you ran away from home.
5 | You were built to complete a special mission.

	Most giff believe they originated on one world, but their home world is now the stuff of legend, because no living giff has seen it or knows where it is. The divine beings who created giff have likewise been forgotten. Their titanic petrified bodies drift on the Astral Sea, isolated and unrecognizable in their current forms.
	Although they don't realize it, giff are drawn to the Astral Plane because, on a deep psychic level, they remain connected to their creator gods, who have just enough divine spark left in them to imbue giff with sparks of their own, which giff have learned to channel through their weapons. Most giff have no idea where this so-called astral spark comes from, but they feel its presence most strongly when they are in Wildspace or the Astral Sea.
	Giff are split into two camps concerning how their name is pronounced. Half of them say it with a hard g, half with a soft g. Disagreements over the correct pronunciation often blossom into hard feelings, loud arguments, and head-butting contests, but they rarely escalate beyond that.

      <text>The first hadozees were timid mammals no bigger than housecats. Hunted by larger natural predators, the hadozees took to the trees and evolved wing-like flaps that enabled them to glide from branch to branch.
	Several hundred years ago, a wizard visited Yazir, the hadozee home world, with a small fleet of spelljamming ships. Under the wizard's direction, apprentices laid magic traps and captured dozens of hadozees. The wizard fed the captives an experimental elixir that enlarged them and turned them into sapient, bipedal beings. The elixir had the side effect of intensifying the hadozees' panic response, making them more resilient when harmed. The wizard's plan was to create an army of enhanced hadozee warriors for sale to the highest bidder. But instead, the wizard's apprentices grew fond of the hadozees and helped them escape. The apprentices and the hadozees were forced to kill the wizard, after which they fled, taking with them all remaining vials of the wizard's experimental elixir.
	With the help of their liberators, the hadozees returned to their home world and used the elixir to create more of their kind. In time, all hadozee newborns came to possess the traits of the enhanced hadozees. Then, centuries ago, hadozees took to the stars, leaving Yazir's fearsome predators behind.
	Today, hadozees are sapient, bipedal beings eager to leave behind the fearsome predators of their homeworld and explore other worlds.
	In addition to being natural climbers, hadozees have feet that are as dexterous as their hands, even to the extent of having opposable thumbs. Membranes of skin hang loosely from their arms and legs. When stretched taut, these membranes enable hadozees to glide. Hadozees wrap these wings around themselves to keep warm.

      <text>Plasmoids are amorphous beings with no typical shape. In the presence of other folk, they often adopt a similar shape, but there's little chance of mistaking a plasmoid for anything else. They consume food by osmosis, the way an amoeba does, and excrete waste through tiny pores. They breathe by absorbing oxygen through another set of pores, and their limbs are strong and flexible enough to grasp and manipulate weapons and tools. Although most plasmoids are translucent gray, they can alter their color and translucence by absorbing dyes through their pores.
	Plasmoids don't have internal organs of the usual sort. Their bodies are composed of cells, fibers, plasma-like ooze, and clusters of nerves. These nerves enable a plasmoid to detect light, heat, texture, sound, pain, and vibrations. Plasmoids can stiffen the outer layers of their bodies to maintain a humanlike shape, so they can wear clothing and accessories. They speak by forcing air out of tubular cavities that constrict to produce sound.
	When plasmoids sleep, they lose their rigidity and spread out and are thus sometimes mistaken for a rock or some other feature of the environment.

      <text>Thri-kreen have insectile features and two pairs of arms. Their bodies are encased in protective chitin. They can alter the coloration of this carapace to blend in with their natural surroundings.
	Although thri-kreen don't sleep, they do require periods of inactivity to revitalize themselves. During these periods, they are fully aware of what's happening around them.
	Thri-kreen speak by clacking their mandibles and waving their antennae, indicating to other thri-kreen what they are thinking and feeling. Other creatures find this method of communication difficult to interpret and impossible to duplicate. To interact with other folk, thri-kreen rely on a form of telepathy.

Many peoples sprang from his divine forge, but not all among them remained as the god created them. Altered by unbridled magic, a group of gnomes were transformed and gifted almost supernatural curiosity and fearlessness. These were the first kender.
	Originating on the world of Krynn, kender are diminutive Humanoids that look like humans with pointed ears and diverse appearances. Kender have a supernatural curiosity that drives them to adventure. Due to this inquisitiveness, many kender find themselves falling through portals to other planes and worlds.
	Kender sometimes amass impressive collections of curiosities. Some might collect mundane knickknacks or relics from magical sites, while others might become professional thieves.

      <name>Proud Dragon Kin</name>
      <text>Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are smiting, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.
	The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans.

      <text>To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods.

Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.
	A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency, of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of that particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.
	Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a client needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races or even from the gods.</text>

      <text>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.

Pallid elves are a subrace of elves distinctive by their pale skin, which is said to be as pale as the moon. The race became pale from living underground away from all light for a long time following the destruction of their home.
	The pallid elves are a mystical and insightful people with skin as pale as the surface of Exandria's largest moon. They emerged from the Pallid Grove this century and wander the world with childlike curiosity.

      <name>Slender and Graceful</name>
      <text>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.
	Elves' coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>A Timeless Perspective</name>
      <text>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.
	Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Hidden Woodland Realms</name>
      <text>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).
	Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Exploration and Adventure</name>
      <text>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</text>

      <name>Elf Names</name>
      <text>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.
	On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf's adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.

Child Names: Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil. Lael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai, Syllin, Thia, Vall

Male Adult Names: Adran, Aelar, Aramil, Arannis, Aust, Beiro, Berrian, Carric, Enialis, Erdan, Erevan, Galinndan, Hadarai, Heian, Himo, Immeral, Ivellios, Laucian, Mindartis, Paelias, Peren, Quarion, Riardon, Rolen, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol, Theren, Varis

Female Adult Names: Adrie, Althaea, Anastrianna, Andraste, Antinua, Bethrynna, Birel, Caelynn, Drusilia, Enna, Felosial, Ielenia, Jelenneth, Keyleth, Leshanna, Lia, Meriele, Mialee, Naivara, Quelenna, Quillathe, Sariel, Shanairra, Shava, Silaqui, Theirastra, Thia, Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia

Family Names (Common Translations): Amakiir (Gemflower), Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel (Moonwhisper), Holimion (Diamonddew), Ilphelkiir (Gemblossom), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Nai'lo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel (Moonbrook), Xiloscient (Goldpetal)</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Age</name>
      <text>Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.</text>

      <text>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies. Others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.

Long tied to the natural heart of the Lotusden Greenwood, these halflings have adapted to live synergistically with the chaotic laws of the wilds.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Small and Practical</name>
      <text>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.
	Halflings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.
	Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They're concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Kind and Curious</name>
      <text>Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.
	Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing what they have even in lean times.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Pastoral Pleasantries</name>
      <text>Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don't recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.
	Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings' hard work and loyal outlook offer them abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.</text>

    <trait category="description">

      <text>The first half-orcs in Wildemount were born of a union between human warriors and orc traitors in the final days of the Calamity. Orcs are one of Exandria's youngest races, and are said to have been born from elves seared by the blood of Gruumsh, the Ruiner, when Corellon pierced the orc god's eye on the field of battle. For long years, orcs were feared as mindless abominations, drawn to slaughter like moths to flame.
	Stories tell of how the blood of the Ruiner flows in the veins of all orcs, driving them to commit acts of terrible violence and anger. Orcs call this fury hgar'Gruum, or the curse of ruin, and use it to refer to everything from battle rage to a bad temper. Half-orcs are said to have inherited the blood of the Ruiner, and to carry the same bloodlust and fury that orcs do.
	Orcs and half-orcs do feel a certain pull toward violence and anger. But the simple truth is that there is no curse of ruin. No supernatural power drives orcs to kill. Rather, they are simply victims of the same selfish, violent impulses that corrupt all mortal beings.

      <name>Half-Orcs in the Dwendalian Empire</name>
      <text>The orcish settlement of Bladegarden was incorporated into the Dwendalian Empire after the fall of the Julous Dominion, nearly three hundred years ago. Orcs are now renowned as some of the empire's most accomplished soldiers, though many folk still fear the ancient legends of the curse of ruin.
	Half-orcs are proud of their heritage, though many are wary of the wrathful curse that supposedly drives them to violence. Those who embrace this gift of fury often enlist in the Righteous Brand to focus their rage against the enemies of the empire. Other half-orcs reject the idea that they are destined for violence, and rely on faith, meditation, and friendship to live peaceful lives. </text>

Most half-orcs on the Menagerie Coast come from the continent of Tal'Dorei as visitors, merchants, or mercenaries, and rarely settle. Half-orc children in the settlements of the coast are often bullied for their unusual teeth.
	Only the Concordian city of Othe has a significant half-orc population. Originally established as a spiritual site for the Ki'Nau people, the city has long attracted orcs and half-orcs who believe that the curse of ruin has caused them to lash out at those they love. In Othe, they find peace through spiritualism—and a place to belong.</text>

They wander the wastes, taming the indigenous beasts and trading with Kryn settlements. The relationship between the orcs and the Kryn is relatively peaceful, though many nomadic orcs are angered when Kryn souls are reborn in orc bodies. These orcs nonetheless readily accept Kryn into their roving clans, seeing it as a point of pride that a city dweller has been drawn to a more exciting life in the chaos of the wastes.
	Most half-orcs in Xhorhas have human or drow blood. In the culture of the Xhorhasian nomads, the union of orcs and goblinkin is strictly taboo, for the clans' elders fear the uncontrolled madness of a soul afflicted by both Gruumsh's curse of ruin and Bane's curse of strife.</text>

      <text>Corvums are commonly accepted, sometimes begrudgingly, to be among the smartest of birdfolk. Keen observers, they trade in information the way others trade goods. They are hungry for knowledge and leverage it to further their goals whenever possible. Their undeniable skill in matters of logistics and planning make them valuable to councils and powerful individuals alike.</text>

      <text>Birds which are known for their dark coloration, such as crows, blackbirds and grackles, would be a good visual fit. Despite typically being dark-feathered, a variety of colorful corvids exist. Jays, nutcrackers, and jackdaws are good examples.
	No matter which type of bird is being used for visual inspiration for your corvum, it is important that they have at least one black feather. Black feathers on a corvum are known as the "Mark of Gesme" and they are thought to impart some of Gesme's reckless curiosity.</text>

      <text>Shrewd and capable, corvums prefer moral flexibility and are more likely to be neutral than either good or evil. Nonetheless, corvums see the benefit of rules, even if many attempt to turn them to their own advantage. Because of this they favor lawful alignments.</text>

      <text>The gallus are a varied folk, resembling as many different varieties of wildfowl as there are trees in the Wood.

Birdfolk are generally welcoming to other races, but the gallus are particularly well-known for their willingness to include virtually anyone in social or familial groups.

      <text>Lumas are a race of polar opposites when it comes to their role in perch society. They are as often shunned for their eccentricities as they are celebrated for them. Lumas are smaller than most birdfolk, and resemble either doves or pigeons. Many have ruffs of feathers that shine with unique iridescent colors, something which can be seen as either alluring or unusual. Most fledgling lumas approach social situations with hesitation, until a time when society inevitably labels them an outcast or a notable figure, and the individual naturally adapts to the role.

As a sable luma, you are often found on the fringes of social situations. While you are overlooked by the crowd, your gifts are undeniable. You are destined for greatness.

These inherent talents, sometimes dismissed as luck, can be improved upon with training and study. Pairing their natural gifts with magical education, powerful luma wizards and radical scholars have been at the forefront of magical innovation for some time in Humblewood.</text>

Other lumas find it difficult to exist in the larger society of birdfolk cities. It is said that this is a main contributing factor for the close-knit, and exclusive luma districts in larger cities. Lumas tend to keep to themselves, preferring the company of those who understand them rather than those who pass judgement.</text>

      <text>Lumas are a race of polar opposites when it comes to their role in perch society. They are as often shunned for their eccentricities as they are celebrated for them. Lumas are smaller than most birdfolk, and resemble either doves or pigeons. Many have ruffs of feathers that shine with unique iridescent colors, something which can be seen as either alluring or unusual. Most fledgling lumas approach social situations with hesitation, until a time when society inevitably labels them an outcast or a notable figure, and the individual naturally adapts to the role.

As a sera luma, you are revered and celebrated by those around you. You have an almost unnatural beauty and grace, inspiring admiration in some and jealousy in others.

      <text>To most, lumas seem perpetually disorganized and distracted, which has lead to a belief that they are of low intelligence. In truth, lumas have a unique perception of the world. They are able to interpret information in an uncommon way, allowing them to see possibilities others cannot.
	These inherent talents, sometimes dismissed as luck, can be improved upon with training and study. Pairing their natural gifts with magical education, powerful luma wizards and radical scholars have been at the forefront of magical innovation for some time in Humblewood.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Of Two Worlds</name>
      <text>While most lumas find their peculiar nature to be a hindrance in society, some make use of their gifts to climb the social ladder. These individuals inspire curiosity and have an air of authority about them. This divide in social standing among lumas can make for curious and strained relationships among families and friends.
	Other lumas find it difficult to exist in the larger society of birdfolk cities. It is said that this is a main contributing factor for the close-knit, and exclusive luma districts in larger cities. Lumas tend to keep to themselves, preferring the company of those who understand them rather than those who pass judgement.</text>

      <text>Lumas are inspired by doves and pigeons, but their size and high charisma means that small songbirds such as chickadees, wrens, sparrows, and cardinals would also be a good fit. A bird-of-paradise could be used as well due to their focus on performance, though they might be better suited for visitors to Humblewood from more tropical regions. Birds with brighter or more decorative plumage would correspond to sera lumas, while those with more muted feathers would be better as sable lumas.</text>

      <text>Spurred by personal interests and flights of fancy, lumas lean towards chaotic alignments. While generally good natured, those that have been spurned by society find it hard to see the benefits of altruism, but even under such circumstances lumas are rarely evil.</text>

      <text>When the birdfolk think of hunters or rangers, they picture a raptor. Resembling small hawks, eagles, and other birds of prey, they have sharp talons and agile builds that help them effortlessly glide through the canopy. These birdfolk are swift and strong with an uncanny knack for tracking. They are rarely prey, and are quick to turn the tables when finding themselves hunted.

As a maran raptor, you are as at home in the water as you are in the trees. You also have a wealth of patience, acting only when it best suits your goals.

Due to this inherent advantage, along with their speed and power, strigs make excellent hunters and rangers.
	Strigs prefer the relative simplicity of the forest to the machinations of society and politics. Despite these individualistic tendencies, they are capable of forming familial and community bonds that transcend a permanent or single physical home.</text>

      <text>Strigs usually resemble owls of all kinds. Owls comprise a very large and diverse family of birds, and examples can be found which are small, large, or unique in appearance. For larger, more intimidating strigs, the great gray owl or giant scops owl can provide a robust presence, while smaller strigs could take inspiration from the little owl, or boreal owl. Regardless of their size, stout strigs tend to be bulkier, with denser feathers, while swift strigs have more slender and streamlined bodies.</text>

      <name>Hale and Hearty</name>
      <text>Cervans have a robust physique and are rarely sick. They are one of the longest-lived races among the humblefolk. Though their wariness has earned them a reputation as timid, cervans are cautious because they remain active and alert, and generally prefer practice to contemplation. Cervans like to pursue skills independently in order to give themselves a sense of purpose. This striving is what propels some cervans to positions of great import throughout the Wood. A happy cervan is one who is hard at work.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Wary and Practical</name>
      <text>One of the reasons cervans form such close-knit communities is a mistrust of outsiders. Before the Treaty, vulpin raiders and mapach thieves were serious threats. These times have long since passed, but cervans still possess a wariness that makes it hard for others to gain their trust. After the implementation of the Humblefolk Treaty, many cervans continued to live by the old ways. However, some cervan villages have since started to contain the odd family of jerbeen, or a few lone hedges. Even under such circumstances, cervans have maintained positions of leadership and delegated responsibilities to make sure that villages are run in accordance with the old cervan teachings, ensuring that work necessary for survival in the most remote villages is accomplished, so that all its inhabitants may be kept healthy and happy.
	The ability to balance their innate caution with practical considerations is one of the cervans' greatest strengths. Cervans teach that the best means of survival in any situation is to remain calm and weigh one's options. The best cervan leaders favor this approach.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>The Sight</name>
      <text>Cervans have a unique ability to bounce back and survive a physical shock that might kill others. Occasionally, cervans who survive such traumas are granted mystical visions. Sometimes these are flashes of insight into the world around them, sometimes portents of doom, and other times visions of a far away future. Known among cervans as "The Sight", this phenomenon is elusive, and out of the control of mortals. Cervans who have seen visions in this way are known as "The Sighted", and after this initial event, some will suddenly find themselves receptive to visions of the past, present, and future.
	A cervan whose Sight has been triggered is encouraged to hone it, so that they might take on the role of a seer within their village. However, these efforts aren't always met with success. The Sight will sometimes visit a cervan only once in their lifetime, with no amount of training granting a glimpse of such visions again. This is believed to be for the best, as cervans acknowledge that those who are truly Sighted carry knowledge that can be both a blessing and a curse.</text>

      <text>The most diplomatic and good natured of all the humblefolk, hedges like to live quiet lives in villages throughout the Wood, or within the safety of birdfolk perches. They resemble hedgehogs, although the quills that cover their backs are far tougher, hard enough to repel blades and sharp enough to pierce the solid hides of monstrous creatures. Despite their sturdiness, hedges are sensitive and emotional creatures, who display meekness more than bravado. Their meek demeanor and deference in social situations has earned them a reputation as cowards in the eyes of outsiders. But rather than being born of cowardice, their behavior stems from a desire to respect the feelings and sensitivities of others, something considered to be of utmost importance in hedge society.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Sensitive and Kind</name>
      <text>Hedges have an incredible capacity for empathy, and tend to view all creatures, from the smallest beetle to the largest beast, as being equally deserving of respect and dignity. They are known across the Wood for being excellent conflict mediators, and usually find themselves acting as diplomats or emissaries between factions trying to broker an agreement.

Hedges feel most at home when everyone gets along. They are one of the few races who truly understand that conflict is not an evil force but simply represents an imbalance which must be resolved. This is not to say that hedges have never known strife, only that their proactive approach to mediation, coupled with their deep respect for the dignity of all living creatures, results in fewer occasions for conflict. Yet, when a serious conflict does arise, hedges who feel they have been truly and deeply wronged can close themselves off from the rest of their society, sometimes resulting in splits in a community.
	One of the reasons hedges display such deep empathy and compassion towards others is due to the intensity of the emotions they feel. The strength of these emotions applies as much to positive feelings it does negative, meaning emotional wounds run deep with hedges.</text>

      <text>Gifted with a unique connection to the Great Rhythm, hedges are tied into the natural world in a fashion similar to the connection possessed by some gallus. This has granted hedges special magical gifts, such as the ability to speak with the smallest ground-dwelling creatures in the Wood, and the power to cause flowers to bloom. It is quite common for hedges to have a variety of animal friends who share their home.

Hedges who dwell outside of the birdfolk cities prefer to live in individual burrows under the great roots of trees. Communities of hedges enjoy living surrounded by nature, near clearings within the forest or lone copses. Central meeting areas and communal gardens can be constructed in the spaces between burrows. Hedges love gardening, and tend to keep a few small gardens wherever they live.</text>

      <text>Hedges need special consideration when wearing clothes, and favor loose tunics, baggy trousers, flowing robes, and other clothes which fit easily over their quills.

However, if suddenly frightened, their quills reflexively flare out and stiffen, an accident which can ruin a hedge's clothing.

Birdfolk is a language of clicks, caws, and whistles. Though primarily oral, a system for writing Birdfolk in pictograms was developed long before the founding of Alderheart and has since transformed into a set of abstract glyphs representing different sounds. Birdfolk can be written quickly with a quill, or scratched easily with a claw, and has been widely adopted throughout the Wood.

Hedge is a language meant to be spoken softly. It confounds many who try to learn it due to the prevalence of passive voice and the deferential manners built into conversation. These are meant to ensure that everyone's feelings are heard and respected. It is written using a variation of Sylvan script.</text>

      <text>Jerbeens are small mouse-like folk with long, furred tails that help them balance. In proportion to the rest of their body, a jerbeen's legs are long and powerful. Jerbeens can be found in a variety of places across the Wood, usually forming their own communities within birdfolk perches and humblefolk villages. Seldom do they live alone. A jerbeen's home can contain several generations, including extended family and cousins living together under one roof. Jerbeens have a strong sense of family and like to surround themselves with good company wherever they rest.

Being small and not particularly strong gives them a perspective that allows them to easily empathize with others, though not all jerbeens share this compassionate outlook. Some respond to the dangers outside their community by becoming insular and fearing all non-jerbeens. Jerbeens value privacy, but true isolation from friends, families, or loved ones is considered to be the worst possible fate a jerbeen could suffer.</text>

      <text>Naturally curious, mapachs are a medium-sized racoon-like race. They are crafty, hearty, and tough, but their true strength lies in the potential they see when looking at the world around them. Mapachs have incredibly light hands and a great degree of fine motor control that doesn't diminish with age. They are also adept at climbing and sneaking. This, combined with their love of trinkets, has earned them an undeserved reputation as thieves. While there are exceptions, most mapachs are quite good-natured, if a little eccentric.

This knack for creating functional or useful items out of debris, junk, or on-hand materials is known as "scroungecraft", and is a cultural staple among mapachs. This activity is considered an art form among mapachs, on par with the high art of other peoples. Scroungecrafting demonstrates creativity, ingenuity, and resourcefulness, but is misunderstood by outsiders who see it as primitive or crude. Genius ideas created by mapach hands frequently began as scroungecraft prototypes. Many who have built such interesting or unique creations achieve celebrity status among mapachs, going on to showcase their skills in loosely-organized scroungecraft fairs.</text>

      <text>You are proficient with tinker's tools. Additionally, you have the ability to construct crude but functional versions of common items using materials present in your surroundings. You may spend 10 minutes to craft these materials into any tool or piece of adventuring gear worth 30 gold pieces or less. The item will be completely functional, even capable of passing for a disguise (if you crafted an article of clothing). Tools, along with any other item that would logically break on its first use (caltrops, arrows), will become useless afterward. Scroungecrafted items will otherwise last 1 hour before falling apart.
	Depending on the materials available, a Game Master (GM) may rule that you cannot craft an item in this way. For example, a vial of acid might be easy to make if you happen to be near a nest of acidic beetle larvae, or bark can be bound into a makeshift flask, but it would be difficult to create a passable facsimile of silken robes from a pile of leaves.
	Should you have access to the proper materials, you can spend 8 hours converting an item you have scroungecrafted in this way into a permanent version, so long as you start this process before the item falls apart. Items crafted in such a way will function exactly as a normal version of the item, and if you have proficiency in the tools used to craft them, they can even look professionally-crafted. Otherwise, they retain a rather rough, cobbled-together appearance. You can also use scroungecraft to repair broken equipment, provided you have the materials on hand. Though, how long your repairs hold together is up to the GM.</text>

      <text>Vulpins are fox-like in appearance, with light builds and sharp fangs. One of the least understood and most often vilified humblefolk in the Wood, vulpins have earned a bad reputation that isn't entirely deserved. Much of this stems from the fact that vulpins are ambitious. Sometimes their drive to succeed can make it difficult for them to empathize with others. Vulpins feel just as deeply as other folk of the Wood, but they possess a keen survival instinct which sometimes causes them to take courses of action that are selfish. Moreover, they are sharp and savvy, possessing an uncanny force of personality that allows them to easily sway the trust of others. In the right situations, vulpins can be true friends, and in the wrong ones, deadly enemies.

Even though vulpins come from every walk of life, they also have a reputation for being snobbish and looking down on others.

Those days are long since gone, but the memory of the sinister vulpin has yet to fade from the minds of the humblefolk, who endured great suffering at their hands.
	A few vulpins have attempted to change public opinion, but the majority are unconcerned with their notoriety.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Disperse and Deploy</name>
      <text>Cnidarans have two distinct phases to their lifecycle: the medusozoa and the polyp. An adventuring cnidaran—one that can speak, has a vaguely humanoid shape, and can manipulate tools—is a medusozoa. These individuals are responsible for interacting with the outside world (in other words, anything beyond their home reef).
	When medusozoa mate, an event that can involve dozens of individuals, the thousands of larvae that are conceived settle on the nearest substrate, often the cnidarans' own coral home. Once rooted, the larvae develop into polyps with two tasks. The first is to grow a single new medusozoa over a single moon's cycle and then birth this inch-long, instinct-driven youngster into the waters surrounding its home. The second is to secrete a calcareous exoskeleton, fusing their body with the reef and growing the cnidarans' coral home.
	Life for a young medusozoa is tenuous; it must fend for itself, drifting in open waters and feeding on plankton and other medusozoa until it reaches at least a foot in length, usually by the end of its third year. During this juvenile stage, a time known as the uko'ulush (the 'wild time'), a medusozoa is largely ignored by other cnidarans, who believe that "trial by ocean makes the hardest pearls." Once a cnidaran completes this juvenile stage, it is brought into the reef, a utilitarian and communal space where the customs, culture, and values of that reef are passed on, the uko'malang (the 'time of waiting').</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Commune and Community</name>
      <text>Cnidarans live communally. With the practices of mass mating and random dispersal, no single medusozoa knows which individuals are their parents. In fact, the entire concept of 'parentage', 'hereditary titles', and 'inheritance' is foreign to most cnidarans.
	When a cnidaran medusozoa reaches maturity, it is given the choice to leave the reef with the blessing of the whole community, a once-in-a-lifetime event known as the uko'fa (the 'time of exploration'). Individuals that start on the uko'fa do so for a multitude of reasons. Some seek to bring back treasures from the world beyond and enhance their own community. Others feel a need to disperse, finding other reefs to join or even forming new reefs with like-minded medusozoa met on their travels. A very few become enraptured by wanderlust and spend the rest of their days among winding ocean currents, delving into damp dungeons, and cavorting in ports with other seadogs.</text>

Intentionally damaging a reef carries grave consequences:
death, exile, or declarations of war are all sanctions a cnidaran colony might employ. It isn't unusual for trade unions to pay handsome reparations if a ship damages a cnidaran reef when blown off course by wild winds. To do otherwise might result in ships foundering even in fair and pleasant conditions, such is the whim of an enraged cnidaran reef.</text>

An adventuring cnidaran—one that can speak, has a vaguely humanoid shape, and can manipulate tools—is a medusozoa. These individuals are responsible for interacting with the outside world (in other words, anything beyond their home reef).
	When medusozoa mate, an event that can involve dozens of individuals, the thousands of larvae that are conceived settle on the nearest substrate, often the cnidarans' own coral home. Once rooted, the larvae develop into polyps with two tasks. The first is to grow a single new medusozoa over a single moon's cycle and then birth this inch-long, instinct-driven youngster into the waters surrounding its home. The second is to secrete a calcareous exoskeleton, fusing their body with the reef and growing the cnidarans' coral home.
	Life for a young medusozoa is tenuous; it must fend for itself, drifting in open waters and feeding on plankton and other medusozoa until it reaches at least a foot in length, usually by the end of its third year. During this juvenile stage, a time known as the uko'ulush (the 'wild time'), a medusozoa is largely ignored by other cnidarans, who believe that "trial by ocean makes the hardest pearls." Once a cnidaran completes this juvenile stage, it is brought into the reef, a utilitarian and communal space where the customs, culture, and values of that reef are passed on, the uko'malang (the 'time of waiting').</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Commune and Community</name>
      <text>Cnidarans live communally. With the practices of mass mating and random dispersal, no single medusozoa knows which individuals are their parents. In fact, the entire concept of 'parentage', 'hereditary titles', and 'inheritance' is foreign to most cnidarans.
	When a cnidaran medusozoa reaches maturity, it is given the choice to leave the reef with the blessing of the whole community, a once-in-a-lifetime event known as the uko'fa (the 'time of exploration'). Individuals that start on the uko'fa do so for a multitude of reasons. Some seek to bring back treasures from the world beyond and enhance their own community. Others feel a need to disperse, finding other reefs to join or even forming new reefs with like-minded medusozoa met on their travels. A very few become enraptured by wanderlust and spend the rest of their days among winding ocean currents, delving into damp dungeons, and cavorting in ports with other seadogs.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>No Place Like Home</name>
      <text>Cnidaran settlements are alive. Made of the bodies of millions of calcified polyps—cnidaran ancestors—a reef is more than just a home; it is the collective memory of a thousand generations, a traceable web of genealogical history, and an esteemed and holy sanctuary. Intentionally damaging a reef carries grave consequences:
death, exile, or declarations of war are all sanctions a cnidaran colony might employ. It isn't unusual for trade unions to pay handsome reparations if a ship damages a cnidaran reef when blown off course by wild winds. To do otherwise might result in ships foundering even in fair and pleasant conditions, such is the whim of an enraged cnidaran reef.</text>

      <text>The pursuit of knowledge, the acquisition of secrets, and the hoarding of trinkets with storied histories are common practices among any creature raised by cyclopians (sy-CLO-pee-ans). From dog tags to tapestries, musical manuscripts to carved tablets, and magical memory orbs to worthless heirlooms, their 'libraries' (as cyclopians refer to their homes) are filled with knowledge. With their physical adaptation to climbing, cyclopian homes are often found high up in cliffsides, within abandoned wizards' towers, or deep in The Low.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Monocular and Myopic</name>
      <text>A cyclopian's singular eye is the perfect metaphor for this race's almost-myopic tendency to focus on one thing to the exclusion of all others. When a cyclopian finds a topic that interests them, little can stop their manic and feverish efforts to acquire any relevant documents, information, or answers. Indeed, the famed cyclopian researcher Roza "Thanks" Thanklinds is rumoured to have forgone sleep for more than two months while analysing the crystallised mut-x from the former laboratory of Dr Frank N. Stein. Of course, this feat was made all the easier thanks to cyclopians' ability to metabolise knowledge into actual, physical, nutritional value.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Arcanists Analogue</name>
      <text>Cyclopians are often mistaken for shadowy aberrations of the Shadow Plane known as nothings. While both cyclopian and nothings share a hulking monocular physiology and a hunger for knowledge, a brief observation yields one significant difference: the skulking simulacra leave a trail of rot and necrosis wherever they travel, while no true cyclopian would ever risk damaging a book in this way.</text>

      <name>Pilgrimage of Hgue Discovery</name>
      <text>Cyclopians of a certain age often embark on a Pilgrimage of Huge Discovery, or PHD. During this time, they venture out into the world, seeking to bring new and significant knowledge back to their library. For some individuals, the natural compulsion to explore is all the impetus they need to leave the comfort of their homes. On the other hand, more reticent cyclopians might have to be forced out by their family, fulfilling this rite of passage based on a sense of duty. Cyclopians who fixate on the acquisition of artifacts, rather than the joy of studying them, are regarded as rare and valuable assets to any family; cyclopian adventurers are always warmly welcomed back to their library.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Sharing is Caring</name>
      <text>Cyclopians have an unusual lifecycle. Though they can reproduce sexually, cyclopians are also capable of a form of asexual budding. When a cyclopian is beyond inundated by the volume of knowledge awaiting its analysis (such as after it gains entry into an abandoned, book-filled wizard's tower), it can spontaneously and unexpectedly undergo entire body mitosis. This produces a smaller, similar, genetically distinct, individual—an assistant with whom the research can be more manageably catalogued.</text>

      <name>Brave Cowards</name>
      <text>You'll likely recognise the back of a gobboc's head more than the front, given their propensity to run away at the first sign of danger. While this is the epitome of cowardice, it is a specifically brave kind of cowardice; life is scary and living another day is the bravest thing you can do. At least, this is what is taught to gobboc from the moment they can walk, a few hours after they're born.
	A typical gobboc is never the first to enter a room nor the last in a line of dungeon delvers. They aim to keep bodies firmly before and behind them, a tactical meat shield to ward off harm. Indeed, gobbocs are the ultimate hit-and-run fighters, retreating from a foe before it can retaliate against their precise and lightning-quick attacks. This method of fighting, taught to all gobbocs, is known as the Klucking Fighting Creed.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Fit and Sit</name>
      <text>Gobbocs have a peculiar tendency to sit on things. The pinnacle of this innate desire is the Festival of Brooding, sometimes known as the Eggstravaganza. This annual event finds all the gobbocs in a town creating the most comfortable thrones, bean bag chairs, and bundles of straw possible before sitting on them around a huge bonfire. There are no fireworks; sudden, loud noises are frowned upon in gobboc society.</text>

      <text>Gobbocs worship other birds. The bigger the bird, the more holy it is. In fact, similarly to kobolds, gobboc belief is innately magical. It is so potent that gobboc belief causes birds to become more intelligent. In times of war, gobboc hosts are often accompanied by flocks of birds: razor-clawed and quick-witted cassowaries form cavalry divisions, while flying contingents are composed of super-intelligent hippogriffs. It is widely posited that the famous gobboc playwright Owlfred Hatchcluck based his play, The Birds, on this uniquely gobboc occurrence.</text>

      <text>Golynn adore rhythm. They find joy in the thrum of a lightning-rail, the clip-clop of a riding goat's hooves, and the heartbeats of their kith and kin. From these everyday occurrences, golynn make wonderfully complex polyrhythms, music whose restorative vibrations can reinvigorate the melancholy and afraid. Indeed, the lead percussionist for the legendary opteran band, Wings of a Butterfly, was Hopo Aman, a golynn maestro of the dwarven tablah.
	Golynn legend tells of a single, pulsing rhythm that drives all life in the world, the golo'apa, or 'Heartbeat of the World'. Many golynn's nomadic existence is a singular quest to explore all the nooks and crannies of the world, searching for this rhythm. In their never-ending pilgrimage, golynn leave a plethora of hidden burrows—warm, safe spaces whose locations are passed on by word of mouth.</text>

      <name>Lizard Legend</name>
      <text>In lotol legend, the first lotol ancestor, Ablon the Stoney, had magnificently hard scales but was a stoic and unfeeling creature. To teach him a lesson, the great Platinum Dragon cursed him to be more sensitive. Ablon's scales fell from his body, and his kin would forever bear this soft-skinned nature as a reminder to always be aware of how your actions might affect the world around you. In their own tongue, lotol are known as the 'lizards without scales'.
	Consequently, lotol often remark when they meet humanoids that do have scales, such as dragonborn, lizardfolk, or golynn. This reaction varies, from awe to envy, or from open infatuation to a fearful expectation of insensitivity or brutishness (stereotypes some lotol individuals hold). A sect of lotol, The Platinum Apology, dedicate their lives to ending this curse and restoring themselves as scale-wearing reptiles. Whether or not this curse is real, let alone possible, is unknown.</text>

      <name>Water Waders</name>
      <text>The few times lotol ever come into conflict with neighbours, it is almost always to do with water. A growing lotol population creates new wetlands by damming up rivers, sometimes to the chagrin of local trappers and woodsfolk. Following floods, whole pods of lotol can find themselves washed downstream into an entirely new (and often recently-drowned) habitat. Fortunately for those that may be reconstructing their lives following such an inundation, lotol are more than keen to help. Lotol with innate aqueous adaptations can prove a blessing to washed-out villages and offset the enmity villagers may feel towards this newly-arrived population of semi-nomadic salamander-folk.
	With their supple, permeable skin, lotol are extremely sensitive to pollutants. If a black dragon poisons the water upstream or heavy metals from a dwarven mine begin to leech into the groundwater, lotol are often the first to know. The only record of lotol going to war is recorded in the oral chant The Cleansing Tide. With the help of a bronze dragon, Chionthan the Forgetful, lotol of the Chion Valley snuck upon the cruel and pernicious Ulvik the Black. There they delivered a mighty electric current into his lair, causing him to flee in fear. Lotol believe that their ability to generate electric currents through their skin is a blessing from the great Chionthan.</text>

      <text>Reusing and recycling are key tenets in the life of any mycelian (my-SEE-lee-an). Nothing is waste; rotten food can fatten a pig, a ruined shirt is a bandage waiting to happen, and corpses are new homes in need of a little bit of reinvigoration. Marginalised and persecuted by most societies, mycelians' propensity to recycle the recently deceased often brings them into conflict with other humanoids. That being said, graverobbers and less scrupulous grey market traders have been known to make a pretty penny out of selling ageing mycelians their next vessels.

      <name>Reuse and Recycle</name>
      <text>Mycelians reanimate the bodies of the recently deceased. Understandably, many more 'civilised' races disagree with this practice—it's difficult to meet your uncle again a few hours after interring him. Moreover, mycelians don't have the same regenerative abilities as the body's original inhabitant; wounds are patched over with a web of hyphae, the skin takes on a pale pallor, and the body wears out fairly quickly, lasting six to seven years.
	Much like hermit crabs wear shells, mycelians inoculate corpses with microscopic spores, before growing a web of hyphae through the body. Nerves are co-opted, muscles are repaired, and fungal organs replace the internal viscera of the host. The process is entirely biological, but less tolerant denizens of the world often believe these reanimated bodies to be the work of necromancers, treating mycelians as infectious, living dead.
	The key to distinguishing a mycelian from a zombie, of course, is the smell. Mycelians carry a hearty, musky aroma like that of a vivacious forest floor. Undead, on the other hand, carry the putrid-sweet scent of decay. After several unfortunate interactions with necromancer-hunters, the Sisters of Mercy began employing dogs, with their keen sense of smell, to help differentiate between innocent mycelians and undead artifice.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Ancestors and Aging</name>
      <text>With each new host, a mycelian's psyche changes a little, moulded by the brain, body, and abilities of the host it co-opts. In moving from one host to another, a mycelian also leaves behind some of its own memories, forever lost to the decay of time. Despite being potentially thousands of years old, the longest-living communities of mycelians often have memories stretching back only a few decades. For this reason, mycelians conduct a ritual shortly before death, where they recant a rhythmic history of their exploits in this host, adding it to the oral history of their community. These oral histories can be days long, and minor word changes (or 'linguistic decay' as scholars refer to it) have resulted in tales becoming more and more outlandish the further back in time they occurred.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Legend of the Mothershroom</name>
      <text>Every mycelian oral history has one thing in common: its beginning. These stories all start with the 'Mothershroom', a behemoth fungal organism and progenitor to all mycelians. In some stories, the Mothershroom takes the form of a giant, multi-coloured tree. In others, it is a miles-wide web of interconnecting, pulsing hyphae that thrum with thought and feeling. Despite their best efforts, no mycelian, explorer, or scholar has ever found the Mothershroom. Any knowledge of its location—if it even exists—has been lost to the grinding wheel of time.
	Many mycelians have embarked on quests to find their ancient ancestor. For some such adventurers, the desire to find this holy figure is the only memory they retain between bodies.</text>

      <text>In the right conditions, a corpse inoculated with mycelial spores can rise as a newly-formed, adult mycelian in under a month.

      <text>Mycelians run the full gamut of humanoid races, from 2-foot-tall gnomes to 8-foot-tall golynns. Your height, weight, and size are determined by the race to which your host corpse belonged in life. It is typically Small or Medium.</text>

      <text>Your unique lifecycle allows you to co-opt some of the adaptations of your host corpse. Choose two of the following adaptations; the race to which your host corpse belonged must have had this racial trait in order for you to choose it (GM's discretion).

	• Damage Resistance (Multiple). You have resistance to one damage type determined by your host body's race.

	• Darkvision (Multiple). The darkened chambers of The Low are your home. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.

	• Dwarven Resilience (Dwarf). You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

	• Halfling Nimbleness (Halfling). You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

	• Muscle Memory (Any). You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice. You can take this option multiple times.

	• Natural Weapon (Multiple). You have a physical characteristic, such as horns, claws, or teeth, that acts as a natural melee weapon which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing dam- age (depending on the body part) equal to your Strength modifier plus a damage die determined by your host body's race, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

	• Powerful Build (Multiple). You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

	• Relentless Endurance (Half-Orc). When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this trait again until you finish a long rest.</text>

      <name>Spore Spray</name>
      <text>As a reaction when a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can attempt to poison it with a burst of spores. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or take 1d8 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn. You can use it a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. This damage increases to 2d8 at 5th level.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="species">
      <name>Insporeation</name>
      <text>When you die within 100 feet of a humanoid corpse that has been dead no longer than 24 hours, and that hasn't been subjected to magic that accelerates decay or prevents decay (such as the gentle repose spell), you can use your dying breath to eject spores to inhabit that corpse. Roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or higher than the distance between your body and the corpse in feet, your spores take hold. For example, a target 30 feet away requires a roll of 30 or higher to succeed.
	On a success, the new body rises again in 2d6 days. You gain the benefits of a long rest and lose your previous Symbiotic Assimilation adaptations, gaining new ones according to the race of the target corpse. On a failure, you die as normal.</text>

      <text>Those who wander the Shadow Plane are doomed to twisted fates and mired minds. These fading, lost souls begin to manifest monstrous forms, although some especially resilient individuals manage to pull themselves from this dark path before their essence is wiped clean. Known as ombrasks (OM-brask), these translucent creatures hail from a variety of heritages; from elf to dwarf, dragonborn to lotol, and rakin to goblin. All struggle to recall even the simplest memory, such as their former name, and all have a ghostly, colourless appearance.

      <name>Momento</name>
      <text>A sense of adventure, a magical mishap, or a cruel curse, there are a multitude of reasons why a native of the Material Plane might find itself shunned to the Shadow Plane. Discovering who they used to be is a motivator for many ombrasks. Do they have parents? Cultural traditions? What is their history? On the other hand, some ombrasks, perhaps those with a foreboding sense of their past misdeeds, choose to ignore what might have come before and focus on living life anew. That is, if their previous life doesn't come calling...</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Almost Unseen</name>
      <text>If an ombrask doesn't find a way to exit the Shadow Plane or isn't summoned by some novice wizard, it can fade entirely, becoming an invisible, skulking creature bent only on survival. In fact, there is strong evidence to suggest that the creature summoned by the unseen servant spell is one of these invisible creatures, temporarily pulled from the Shadow Plane. The fate of those too far gone is enough to stop most explorers from staying long in that dull and lifeless expanse.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Shadow Memories</name>
      <text>One of the first things an ombrask forgets is its voice. Though it knows and can understand the meaning of words, its cadence, pitch, and patterns of speech fade from lack of use; the dreary, joyless experience of the Shadow Plane leaves little to talk about. However, ombrasks become especially sensitive to the psychic burst of emotion that accompanies death, the freeing of a soul from its shadow-numbed body. Ombrasks can latch onto the shreds of this psyche and adopt its speech patterns, learning to mimic them perfectly.
	Next lost is the ability to feel, love, and smile; any emotion associated with joy or excitement is nullified. With prolonged distance from the Shadow Plane, or exposure to realms of strong emotion, such as the Plane of Fey or Springarden, these sensations can make a slow return for a lucky few. What is never lost is the memory of mundane tasks, such as ploughing, chopping wood, or polishing armor. Muscle memory is scarred into the minds of ombrasks, making them particularly deft at tiny, detailed work.</text>

From the bodyguards of mighty, stonewilled nobles, to adopted playmates of excitable halflings, oozekin are found everywhere, though in small numbers. Taking on the values of those that surround them, oozekin are hard to pigeonhole and have but one thing in common: a delight in immersing their newfound consciousness in the habits and customs of other sapient creatures.

      <name>Oozey Re-birth</name>
      <text>If a player character dies in an area rich with biomancy, you can consider allowing their character to be reborn as an oozekin. A biomantic ooze may well consume the grey matter of their brain and adopt a plethora of their personality traits, memories, and class levels.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Biomantic Origins</name>
      <text>Oozekin are the odd by-products of Dr Stein's biomancy experiments—biomantic oozes that gained consciousness and self-replicate through asexual reproduction. When the time is right, an oozekin produces a larval sludge: a juvenile, biomantically-altered ooze not dissimilar to those one might find in a dungeon. After this larva consumes enough sentient grey matter, it exhibits a sudden cognitive and physiological metamorphosis, rising as a humanoid-shaped oozekin.
	These unmoulded, newly-formed consciousnesses are extremely susceptible to the psyches of creatures near them both in space and time. An oozekin that develops in the former lair of a red dragon might take on its avaricious and arrogant personality traits, while one that forms near a sleeping adventurer might be filled with wanderlust and risk-taking qualities. Indeed, the grey matter that a biomantic ooze consumes can have a significant influence on the subsequent oozekin's values, habits, and memories. Tales abound of oozey doppelgangers, facsimiles of fallen adventurers that believe themselves to be the deceased creature reborn.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Willing and Able</name>
      <text>Relatively new to the world, oozekin are keen to prove themselves the equal of any other race. Though most oozekin exist within the framework of other, established civilisations, pods of oozekin settlements have arisen in corners of The Low. These conglomerations mix the various assimilated cultures and traditions each oozekin has experienced or formed with, often with unpredictable consequences. Luckily, oozekin's propensity to get along with one another has resulted in the reconciliation of schisms between historically antagonistic races, such as grey dwarves and dark elves, even if only vicariously through their oozekin adoptees.
	Most oozekin are more than happy to fulfil their role as helpful and productive citizens, contributing to society in any way they can. Others, perhaps those that accidentally harmed friends with their acidic skin, go to obscene lengths to disguise their true form, covering themselves head to toe in scraps of clothing, never staying in one place too long. An especially curious and introspective few live to discover the reason for their existence. How come they have no parents? Where is their history? Why do they exist?</text>

Cube Form. Your walking speed is halved and your body becomes a 5-foot cube. You can safely store any items you are carrying, holding, or wearing in a vesicle within your body. Creatures directly behind you have three-quarters cover against attacks that originate on the opposite side of you. You also gain a new action option, the Engulf action:

Engulf. You move up to your speed and can attempt to move into the space of one creature of equal or smaller size than you, which must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failure, if you aren't already grappling a creature, the creature becomes grappled by you. While grappled in this way, the creature is restrained and takes acid damage at the start of each of its turns as if it had failed a saving throw against your acid splash cantrip. On a success, you expend the movement but remain in the space from which your movement originated.

Puddle Form. Your walking speed is halved as you collapse into a 5-foot-diameter pool. You can't hold  or carry items and any objects you are holding, carrying, or wearing when you transform fall to the ground in your space. While in this form, attack rolls by creatures further than 5 feet away from you have disadvantage to hit you, you non-magically gain the benefits of the spider climb spell, and you can travel through spaces as small as 1 inch wide without squeezing.</text>

      <text>A sedentary life among the birds and insects of their treetop dwellings is the most adventurous goal of many opterans' lives. In shades of green and brown, these larval opterans (OP-ter-an) are happy to avoid conflict, camouflaging into the canopy from which they acquire sustenance. But, with a brilliant flash of colour, an adult opteran injects this placid scene with a vivacious zest for life. Frantic flaps of its broad, multicoloured wings usher this metamorphosed form to and fro, a sparkling rainbow that nary takes a moment to rest.

      <name>Live Fast, Die Young</name>
      <text>Opterans can, in theory, live forever. So long as they are never stressed (and have no goals for reproduction), a larval opteran doesn't age and can enjoy an indefinite life of sedentary bliss. However, should the need arise, such as during times of environmental catastrophe, war, or fits of passion, a larval opteran enters a chrysalis in which it metamorphoses into its winged, adult form. Once it emerges, the clock begins ticking; it lives no more than 2 or 3 years in this form, just long enough to find a mate and produce a new batch of larvae elsewhere in the world.
	Because of this, larval opterans are extremely conflict-averse. If a predator comes a-calling, a larval opteran prefers to deploy its sticky 'string shot' and retreat to the safety of its tree-home, rather than potentially become overstimulated. Conversely, adult, winged opterans often lose this sense of self-preservation, a behaviour change that the uneducated might describe as 'disturbing'.</text>

So in-demand were tickets to this once-in-their-lifetime show, that monarchs even traded small earldoms in order to purchase a show for their courts.
	Opterans that choose to venture into the wider world are often old, tired of the sedentary life, and ready for adventure.

      <text>The mistaken spawn of a passionate tryst between deities of trickery and nature, rakin hold a deep affinity for both domains. Since their creation, they have had little contact with either god, learning to rely on their own wits to survive.

Trickery. As rakin society progressed, their culture grew to value trickery and subterfuge. Good-natured pranks sprang from their paws as instinctively as breathing. Honed against the fearsome beasts of the forest, this innate talent to deceive helped the rakin bloom as a civilisation. Tales are still told of how Mack Gyver fought off a rampaging owlboar with nought but a goodberry, a silver needle, and a pig's bladder.

Pranks. Rakin politics, religion, and interpersonal relationships revolve around the idea of practical jokes. An atmosphere of one-up-manship and lighthearted merriment suffuses all of their wheelings and dealings. Even when faced with the most horrid of circumstances, a rakin's first instinct is to crack a joke.</text>

From sewer-side burrows to palatial penthouses, wattle-and-daub huts to intricate treetop villages, rakin can be found at all levels of society, a product of their ingeniousness and habit of getting into trouble. One is rarely bored around a rakin.

While the tanukin and urkin found homes in forests and cities, a third, smaller contingent embraced their wanderlust and a life of vagabondry. With the road as their home, posskin never settle in one place for long and are well adapted to the harsh conditions associated with constantly sleeping outdoors. Their ability to withstand disease enables them to act as scavengers, feasting on the left-to-rot remains of other carnivores. Should they ever find themselves the target of a territorial creature, their innate ability to play dead can often trick such aggressors into believing they are no longer a threat and leaving them alone, if a little bloodied.
	Posskin might find employ in a variety of walks of life. From hedge knights to circus performers, travelling snake oil salesmen to chronic dumpster divers, so long as the job keeps moving, a posskin stays happy.

Tanukin believe that civilization is a sacrilegious destruction of the beautiful chaos of nature. So rarely do tanukin venture into humanoid settlements that they are often mistaken for racoons, or worse, urkin. The times they do deign to enter the 'stone forests', it is to use their illusion magic to evoke the divine chaos and confusion that they associate with the natural world.

      <text>Wechselkind A mother hears a sound in the night and worriedly checks on her sleeping toddler. Nothing appears amiss, but weeks later the glamour fades and the true horror is revealed: the child has been stolen by the taerie, and a wechselkind is left in its place. The faerie are callous and unchanging beings, so nothing sparks their fascination (and their envy) more than the malleable, bright spark of a young human child.
	A wechselkind is a construct crafted of wood, clay, and ceramic in the form of a small child, animated by faerie magic and concealed in a glamour that makes them appear identical to a stolen mortal babe. Once the glamour fades and the lie is revealed, the wechselkind is often cast out by its foster family, if not destroyed.
	Occasionally, though, a family takes pity on the poor creature and attempts to raise it as they would a child, only to find that while their mind develops normally, a wechselkind is forever bound in the unchanging form of a childlike doll.
	Whether nurtured or shunned, the wechselkind eventually finds itself an outcast in the world and must fend for itself as best it can. With few physical needs, the wechselkind often wanders from place to place, watching the people it encounters with envious eyes, hoping for a place to finally fit in.
	The residual magic of its faerie glamour allows it to conceal itself in the guise of a human child, and a lone wechselkind often takes to begging by the side of the road or doing odd jobs around an isolated farmhouse, searching for some scraps of acceptance or a small trinket or two to take with it when it must inevitably move on.
	Recently, with the advent of the Weeping Pox, the wechselkind have started to emerge from hiding and be recognized as a separate race of creatures. With their immunity to disease, a number of wechselkind have offered their services as nurses and doctor s assistants in plague-stricken regions, gaining recognition and praise from those able to see beyond their tragic beginnings. These wechselkind are grateful for a sense of purpose and a place to belong, but remain wary. Once their usefulness is at an end, they know they may be cast out once more.

Constructed of sturdy materials and enchanted with powerful faerie magic, wechselkind possess several traits that distinguish them from the other races of Etharis.

      <text>As constructs, the wechselkind do not age as normal creatures do. They are forever trapped in the doll-like body of a stolen child.

      <text>Deep beneath the waves lies the Llana'Shi Empire. An ancient race, the laneshi straddle the line between life and death, communing with spirits for guidance and unafraid to meet death on the battlefield. Pale humanoids with manes of kelp-like hair, they seek the underlying duality of everything they encounter. A laneshi is more likely than not to view matters in absolutes and react accordingly. Friend or foe. Day or night. Acceptance or rejection. All things must have their place, and to this end they have developed a rigid caste system.
The mystic caste comprises all those laneshi who are born as twins, a very common occurrence. When this happens, the first-born of the pair is inducted into the mystic caste, while the other twin is consecrated as his or her sibling's spirit guide. Using a powerful necromantic ritual, the second twin is sacrificed and its soul bound within the body of the other. Each member of the mystic caste is therefore possessed of two souls: one living and one dead. This grants them vision into the spirit world and heightens their necromantic abilities. Mystics are in charge of all things that possess no life, and are therefore in charge of funeral rites, crafting, construction, recordkeeping, and food preparation. Heavier duties are usually performed with the aid of undead labor.
	The second caste, the warrior caste, is in charge of all things relating to the living. This includes not only warfare, but also ruling, diplomacy, farming, the raising and educating of children, and so forth. The warrior caste is roughly double the size of the mystic caste and is structured as a meritocracy, with great deeds leading to greater status. The laneshi are constantly at war wit their deep-dwelling neighbors, and use their ability to speak with the marine wildlife to find opportunities for heroism and advancement.
	Despite this, the rulers of the Llana'Shi Empire have recently turned their eyes toward the surface for unknown reasons. Perhaps some new and greater threat is stirring in the dark depths of the sea, and the Laneshi seek aid from their air-breathing cousins. Or perhaps the rumors of mysterious visitors to the royal palace and blasphemous compacts with ancient evils are true, and the laneshi king is looking for new lands to conquer to appease the hunger of his unnamable master.

The circumstances of their birth determine which caste a particular laneshi belongs to, and therefore the rituals and training which govern their early life. The warrior caste involves rigorous physical training, weapon skills, and mounted combat. The mystic caste are born as twins, and contain the bound soul of their departed sibling bound within themselves.
	Laneshi warriors bear traits informed by their heritage and training.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The populous races of Etharis all have stories about the ogresh, although few have seen them in person. Stories describe them as solitary wise men and women who serve as founts of information and advice for the nearby communities. Adventure tales abound where the protagonist receives counsel from an ogresh before setting off on their quest, and yet others describe royal advisors with a distinctive set of wide features. Regardless of the veracity of such tales, the ogresh still exist across the continent, viewed as something of an exotic oddity.
	In truth, the scarcity of the ogresh is a result of their particular biology. Young ogresh mature slowly, and during their extended youth, which may last decades, they are driven by a deep-seated sense of wanderlust. This feeling compels them to travel in search of a suitable area to settle, consisting of ample natural resources, a local population of sentient creatures, and a lack of other ogresh nearby. Once they decide upon an area, an ogresh enters the second stage of their life, which is marked by a drastically increased appetite and a mostly sedentary lifestyle. More than a single ogresh could easily deplete the surplus of a small village, so the reason for their wanderlust is a simple case of biological necessity.
	Given their reliance on other species, it comes as no surprise that the ogresh are masters of social interaction. Each individual is born with an inherent ability to read body language and vocal cues helpful in discerning the attitude of others. Indeed, the vast stores of knowledge often attributed to the ogresh is a reflection of their uncanny ability to glean information about an individual through these subtle clues. Even a casual conversation could end up revealing far more than one would intend to these keen observers, and the ogresh are smart enough to capitalize on such information.

Ogresh possess inborn traits that contribute to their reputation as master communicators.

A young ogresh usually ranges between 200 and 300 pounds, while an older, settled ogresh can get upwards of 700 to 800 pounds. Your size is Medium.</text>

      <text>With the end of the Gods' End war, the Arch Seraphs of each deity descended upon the world, each taking upon their own shoulders the burden of imposing order on a world cast into disarray. These Arch Seraphs were the most powerful lieutenants among the angelic hosts, strong enough to retain a semblance of their power following the tragedy. The lesser angels were not so lucky. Many found themselves wholly bereft of their powers, cast down to Etharis to live out their nowmortal lives amidst the lesser races.
	The downcast, as they have come to be called, are far fewer in number than when they first arrived, with a great number of them succumbing to despair and sickness after their fall from grace. Of those who remain, some still serve the Arch Seraphs in their twisted crusades, hoping to reclaim what they have lost. Others have turned their backs on their former comrades to seek their own goals, fully embracing mortal life. Lastly are those who feel embittered by their fall and have been gleefully accepted by the Arch Demons as agents to spread fear and destruction.
	Physically, the downcast still possess the beauty of their angelic forms, although they no longer shine as brightly as before. The mark of the divine still remains as a visible glow within their eyes, and faint markings on their skin mimic Celestial runes.
	There is also variation based on the deity that each served in the past. Those who follow Maligant are physically stronger, Galt's host are hardy and resilient, Ulmyr's are possessed of a keen intellect, and Aurelia's kin have softer features and soothing voices.
	Over time, the downcast have learned to tap into the small shreds of divine power that lie sleeping within their blood. That power still remembers the downcast's former purpose and can be harnessed in times of great need to aid those who once called upon the gods for their power. This ability is as dangerous as it is powerful, for there are many who would seek to take it by force. Fallen clergy who seek to drain the downcast in order to restore their own failing powers, vampires seeking to drink from a fountain of the tainted divine, even those who treat with powerful entities alien to this world, are all potential predators to a fallen angel. Indeed, there are some who have already discovered this secret and are willing to go to any lengths in order to obtain it.

Downcast still bear the marks of immortality that have been robbed from them.

      <text>History repeats itself. Even before the humans had their Eras of Expansion and Descent, other races had built empires on Etharis. The elves and the dwarves both had their time, and other, older races did as well. Where the dwarves of Stehlenwald live today was once the seat of an ancient empire that surpassed any that have come since. The name of this empire has been lost, and only fragmented remains of the oldest stories even hint at the grand heights that race once reached.
	What can be gleaned from the histories of the elves and dwarves is that at one point a horrible calamity befell the land, wiping clean any trace of this ancient empire. The disaster came suddenly and without warning, and it was believed that nothing survived. Something did.
	When the humans rose to power and began threatening the elves and dwarves, the Stehlenwald dwarves were forced to dig deeper into their mountain strongholds in order to withstand the siege. Deep in the dark, even below the adamantine that proved to be their salvation, the dwarves found sealed chambers dating back to before the cataclysm. With the seal broken, an ancient spell was lifted and the chambers' inhabitants began to stir from their millennia-long slumber.
	In the days before the calamity wiped out their civilization, a group of these "dreamers" foresaw the danger and came up with a plan to survive it. Time passes differently in dreams, and the ancients sought to use that fact to free themselves from the flow of time. Suspended between reality and dreams, sealed deep underground, they could live in a state of perpetual slumber for as long as necessary and outlast the disaster that would wipe out the rest of their kind.
	The plan worked, but living for so long within the dream-world had unforeseen consequences. Upon waking, the dreamers found that they could no longer differentiate between dreams and memories, with both fading quickly from their minds. The result was the emergence of a new race with no knowledge of their own history, only halfformed images and dream-like impressions of a place and time that may or may not have existed.
	Now the dreamers struggle to adapt in a world that seems like a waking nightmare. Whatever their history, they have proven to be quick-witted and strong, able to learn new tasks and execute them well. Their long slumber has left them strangely energized and able to work even beyond the legendary endurance of the dwarves. Even so, sleep is where the dreamers still feel most at home, and they have a habit of quickly dozing off whenever no immediate task presents itself.

Dreamers' connections to the dream world change their mortal forms.

      <text>To cast one's mind out amongst the outer planes is the dream of many an arcane spellcaster. In recent memory, none have come closer to that dubious honor than the lost city of Ulmyr's Gate. Founded by a group of ambitious wizards who chafed under the limitations imposed upon them by government bureaucracy, Ulmyr's Gate boasted free study for all mages who sought sanctuary within its walls. The Great College quickly became a lodestone for mages of every stripe from across the empire, and for a brief moment there existed a golden age of magic.
	That dream came crashing down one night when the founding mages of Ulmyr's Gate attempted a massive conjuration ritual intended to part the veil and create a permanent portal to the Ethereal Plane. It didn't work. Instead their magic caused a massive rift in the very fabric of reality, and in an instant the entire city tipped into the void between worlds. The entire city was presumed dead, the Arcanist Inquisition railed against the hubris of those tampering in things man was not meant to know, and life in the Empire moved on.
	Years later, stories surfaced of strange people being sighted in the region where Ulmyr's Gate once stood. These people seemed oddly blurred or indistinct, and some reports said they vanished right in front of witnesses' eyes. Gradually it became clear that these poor souls were the survivors of the Ethereal Rift, now trapped between worlds and trying to retain their tenuous grasp on the Material Plane.

You possess certain traits as a result of the magical mishap that trapped you between worlds. The disembodied are a collection of races that were in Ulmur's Gate when the accident occurred. Because of this, you can choose what race you appear as. This also affects some features below, such as your height. Unless specified, you do not gain any racial features from your origin race.

	Elves are strongly associated with green mana, the magic that flows through their forest homes. Their shamans and druids channel this magic of life and growth, communing with the land or the spirits of the departed. Striving to live in harmony with nature, they celebrate the ties between their communities and their connection with the broader world around them.

The elves of the imperious Joraga nation of Bala Ged have little respect for any other race of Zendikar—or even for other elves. The survival of their nation and its traditions is the Joraga elves' only goal, and they view the influence of others as a weakness. The Joraga eschew the goods and habits of others, even avoiding the pathways blazed by the Tajuru when possible. Many view the nomadic Joraga clans as little more than bands of roving murderers, but a complex culture hides behind those clans' aggressive exterior.

Elves of the Mul Daya nation of Bala Ged are set apart from other elves by their relationship with the spirits of their elven ancestors. To the Mul Daya, the spirit world and the mortal realm are different only in terms of their tangibility. Death and the spirits of the dead are as much a part of the lives of the Mul Daya as is the natural world. This is not a macabre sentiment to the elves; they simply view it as the truest sense of the natural order.
	Mul Daya elves can often be recognized by their face painting and tattooing. Many Mul Daya decorate their skins with an enwrapping vine motif, and make use of poisons and acids collected at great cost from strange creatures and plants in the depths of Kazandu.

      <text>Goblins are an inquisitive and adaptable race hampered by their small size, their natural cowardice, and a severe shortage of common sense. They eagerly explore areas that others hesitate to enter, and obsessively fiddle with magic that more sensible folk would take careful precautions with. They prize ancient artifacts not for their inherent value, but primarily as a mark of status—for a precious trophy proves that its owner survived a delve into a deep and dangerous ruin.
	Goblins are associated with red mana. Their shamans are fond of spells that create or control fire and lightning to smite their foes, and they are quick to follow their impulses and passions into action without much forethought. Life to a goblin is an adventure full of new things to explore and experience.

Smaller and weaker than their cousins, and with larger hands and feet, goblins of the Grotag tribe attempt to live by their wits-though seldom with much success. When a Grotag goblin has the bright idea of trying to tame fleshpiercer mites, at least a few others will be willing to follow that goblin into a nest-usually to predictably horrible results. But though the Grotag seem to have a never-ending supply of bad ideas, and a horrible ratio of bad ideas to good, the Grotag likewise seem to have a never-ending supply of Grotag. As such, by trial and error (and more error), these goblins have stumbled across a great deal of knowledge useful for surviving the deep places of Zendikar, and for dealing with the creatures that live there. The Grotag imagine themselves to have a sort of empathy with beasts, and they lose hundreds of goblins each year to ill-advised attempts at monster taming. But, every now and again, one of these efforts is successful.

      <name>Long Arms and Stony Skin</name>
      <text>A typical goblin stands between three-and-a-half and five feet tall, with a slender, elongated build. Goblins' arms are unusually long and spindly, making them adept at climbing cliffs and trees. Their skin has a stony texture, ranging in color from red-brown to moss green or gray. Their ears are large and swept back, their eyes are intensely red, and many sport heavy bone protrusions on their spines or elbows. Males have similar growths jutting from their chins, while females have heavier growths on their foreheads.
	This distinctive appearance is a direct result of the goblins' unusual diet. Before the Eldrazi's rise, goblins supplemented their normal diet with a kind of rock they pounded into bits and called "grit." The presence of the Eldrazi in Zendikar has poisoned this rock, so the goblins have taken to eating powdered hedrons instead. Eating this magic-infused stone has given the goblins resistance to the maddening psychic emanations of the Eldrazi. As an added benefit, it toughens their skin, protecting them from the elements and from physical dangers.</text>

      <text>Goblins are an inquisitive and adaptable race hampered by their small size, their natural cowardice, and a severe shortage of common sense. They eagerly explore areas that others hesitate to enter, and obsessively fiddle with magic that more sensible folk would take careful precautions with. They prize ancient artifacts not for their inherent value, but primarily as a mark of status—for a precious trophy proves that its owner survived a delve into a deep and dangerous ruin.
	Goblins are associated with red mana. Their shamans are fond of spells that create or control fire and lightning to smite their foes, and they are quick to follow their impulses and passions into action without much forethought. Life to a goblin is an adventure full of new things to explore and experience.

The Lavastep tribe is the most industrious of the goblin tribes, and possesses much hard-won knowledge of the geothermal activity in Akoum. More so than members of the other tribes, the Lavastep goblins build surprisingly effective equipment out of the crystal shards and veins of strange metals that occasionally boil up to the surface. The most warlike of their kind, Lavastep goblins frequently harass the kor, elves, and humans of Akoum.

      <text>In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that's why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.

Old grudges still linger, but the well-being of the merfolk race—and the world—far outweigh any ancient conflicts between creeds.
	Merfolk are associated with knowledge, logic, and strategy, though the traditional merfolk creeds express this connection in different ways.

The merfolk race is divided into three creeds, founded on the principles of Emeria (wind), Ula (water), and Cosi (the trickster). A merfolk isn't born into a creed but chooses it upon reaching adulthood, and it is rare for a merfolk not to choose a creed. Merfolk of the wind and water creeds aren't hostile to each other, but members of each creed regard the other creed with a vague disdain. Members of both those creeds regard the Cosi creed with suspicion and some degree of fear, and Cosi-creed adherents tend to keep their affiliation secret.

Ula-creed merfolk emphasize intellectual pursuits, stressing hard evidence and reason over passion. They are analytical scholars, chroniclers, explorers, and navigators who pride themselves on being blunt and straightforward.

      <name>Born of the Sea</name>
      <text>Merfolk are an amphibious race, born and at home in the water but comfortable on dry land. Humanoid in form, they have skin of ivory, silver, russet, blue, or deep purple. Long fins extend from the backs of their forearms and calves, and their fingers and toes are webbed. The hairlike growths on their heads are either thick and bristly like the needles of a sea urchin, or long and wavy, resembling fine seaweed. In either case, these growths typically range in color from red to warm brown to black. Male merfolk have similar growths extending down from their cheekbones.
	Merfolk wear little clothing unless they are armored for battle. Even then, they drape themselves with nets and a minimum of cloth, wearing armor crafted of large, bleached seashells and augmented with leather.</text>

      <text>Born into ancient servitude and bred to a life of decadent corruption, the vampires of Zendikar feed on the energy in the blood of living creatures—an energy that is particularly strong in times of terror and pain. To members of the other races, vampires are a fearsome mystery and the stuff of nightmares, hunting their prey like beasts or reclining on thrones made of skulls in their moss-draped cities. But few understand how the vampires are locked in a brutal civil war. On one side are those who hold to their traditional ways, desperately battling to remain free. On the other side are those vampires whose legacy reaches back into the deepest recesses of history. Bound once more to the Eldrazi who were their ancient masters, those vampires hunt their kin in an effort to extinguish any dreams of freedom and rebellion.
	Vampires are associated with black mana. Their existence is predicated on draining the life from others to fuel their own existence, and on putting their own lives ahead of all other concerns. Philosophically, they do not constrain themselves with artificial rules of morality, but believe that the strong can and should take what they need from the weak.

      <name>Between the Living and the Dead</name>
      <text>The vampires of Zendikar are not undead. Rather, their unique nature comes from an eldritch disease that turns their flesh cold, makes their gray or purple skin feel dead to the touch, and enables them to drain concentrated magical energy from the blood of other living creatures. They are tall and slender, with long, elegant necks and broad shoulders. Bony horns protrude from their shoulders and elbows, often augmented by the layered plates of their armor and clothing. Their canine teeth are slightly elongated, but not enough to protrude between their closed lips.
	Vampires dress in leather and the chitin carapaces of the gigantic insects that dwell in the swamps and jungles of their native Guul Draz, augmented with fine silk and gauzy fabric. They decorate their skin in elaborate, symmetrical patterns of red paint made from blood and mineral pigments. Their clothing is an odd mixture of complex layers and elaborate patterns combined with plenty of exposed skin, since their cold bodies are unaffected by the temperature around them.</text>

      <text>When the events of a lifetime are compressed down to almost nothing, each fleeting moment must be savored ­—drained of every drop of enjoyment it can offer. This is the philosophy that informs the lives and minds of the aetherborn. Given just a few short years—or sometimes only a few months—to live, each aetherborn views time as exceedingly precious. Each moment spent in a way that does not bring delight is a wasted moment. And though aetherborn differ in their drives and pleasures, nearly all of them share this desire to squeeze the most out of the brief time they are given.
	Aetherborn come into being spontaneously as part of the aether refinement process. Their bodies and minds are apparently formed out of some interaction between the volatile elements of aether that are removed during refinement and the psychic impressions created by the people involved in the process. But each aetherborn is a unique individual, not a mere copy of some other person's mind and shape. This race is little understood, and few aetherborn are willing to waste any of their short lives allowing vedalken scholars to study their biological and psychological characteristics.

On the one hand, aetherborn understand that their race wouldn't exist without the Consulate's aether refining operations, so they feel at least some motivation to ensure that those operations continue to run smoothly. On the other hand, few aetherborn have any patience for the tedious and cumbersome politics and regulations of the Consulate, which gives them at least a little sympathy with renegade philosophy. Typically, aetherborn are drawn to one side or the other more by the lure of excitement and entertainment than by any serious political beliefs.</text>

      <name>Gift of the Aetherborn</name>
      <text>An unknown aetherborn, desperately seeking a means to extend their short life, discovered a process of transformation that prolonged their existence—by giving them the ability to feed on the life essence of other beings. Since then, other aetherborn have learned and carried out this monstrous transformation, and aetherborn with this "gift" have become a small minority among an already small population.
	A gifted aetherborn has the ability to drain the life essence of other beings. Similar to the way heat is transferred from a warm object to a cold one, a gifted aetherborn need only touch another living being with a clawed hand to draw life essence out, fueling their own continued existence while draining strength and vitality from their victim.
	For many aetherborn, living as they do for indulgence and instant gratification, the concepts of "want" and "need" are virtually synonymous. But Aetherborn with this gift understand what it is to truly need, for they develop a hunger for life essence that far exceeds any desires they might have felt before their transformation. A gifted aetherborn who abstains from this feeding deteriorates even more rapidly than other aetherborn, while enduring unspeakable agony caused by the deprivation of life energy.
	At the DM's option, an aetherborn character can research methods of achieving this dark "gift." The process is similar to inventing and manufacturing a rare magic item (see "Inventing and Manufacturing Devices" earlier in this document). But rather than aether, the process requires a variety of rare unguents and unusual ingredients that make up the cost of researching and undergoing the transformation.
	An aetherborn with this gift gains the Drain Life ability: a natural attack that deals 1d6 necrotic damage and restores the same number of hit points to the aetherborn. However, if the aetherborn goes for 7 days without dealing this damage, their hit point maximum is reduced by 1d6 per week. This reduction can't be removed until the aetherborn has used their Drain Life ability and completed a long rest.</text>

      <text>"It's dwarf built. There is no finer mark of quality."

To the artisans of Kaladesh, a device's beauty is almost as important as its function. Different artists, though, have different definitions of beauty, and to most dwarves, the highest mark of beauty is quality. Nothing is more exquisite than a machine that endures—one that functions perfectly, with a minimum of maintenance, despite the passage of years.

Dwarves don't understand laziness or shortcuts. Just as a machine must function smoothly at all times, so too an artisan should work steadily and with care. Dwarves take pride in their work ethic, and abhor any attitude or behavior that would undermine the quality of their work. They are more thorough than speedy, and although a dwarf's work might take longer to complete, its quality makes the time worthwhile. If a job must be done, a dwarf will see that it is done correctly. And when a dwarf repairs a machine, it will work as well as it did when it was first built, if not better—and it will last.
	Among the folk of other races, dwarves have a reputation for being utterly fearless. This is largely because their work often finds them scaling tall buildings or hanging from the undersides of airships. Far from being reckless, though, dwarves enter any potentially dangerous situation with firm safeguards in place, thoroughly prepared to avoid any accident. With an unshakable trust in the quality of harnesses, scaffolding, and handiwork, a dwarf has no need to fear falling.

      <name>Dwarf Politics</name>
      <text>Dwarves gravitate to where the work is. Accordingly, many dwarves appreciate the Consulate as an inexhaustible source of work opportunities. For its part, the Consulate values dwarves for their painstaking, perfectionist approach to building and maintenance. As a result, dwarves are employed at every level of the Consulate government, including having representatives among the Enlightened Keepers, the consuls themselves. Dwarf edificers keep the machinery of the cities running smoothly, while dwarf enforcers protect property and help keep the peace. However, it is the potential for making great things, more so than any philosophical leaning, that ties most dwarves to the Consulate.
	Dwarves are not typically drawn to politics, but some do take issue with what they see as slapdash construction carried out in the Consulate's foundries. Mass production on the scale of the Consulate's efforts is an affront to the ideals of true artisanship, they argue, and those who are most offended by this insult sometimes align themselves with renegade groups.</text>

      <text>"Everything is connected, and aether flows through it all."

The movement of aether through the world is visible and obvious where it courses in glowing rivers across the sky, sweeps across sculpted plains, or pours through great urban pipelines. But the elves of Kaladesh are uniquely in tune with the flow of aether throughout the plane, both seen and unseen, and with the subtle ways it suffuses and influences all life. They call this flow the Great Conduit, and they believe that the only way to truly grasp it is to be a part of it, simultaneously shaping it and being shaped in return.
	Thanks to this sensitivity, elves feel a deep connection to other living things. They engage deeply with the world around them, delighting in natural systems and social interactions alike. They revel in exploring the interconnectedness of nature and society, seeing the flow of aether from nature to invention, from person to person, from body to mind and heart.
	Elves live in harmony with both nature and technology. They believe that nature inspires technology: each piece of artifice is an expression of natural laws and principles, and captures one element of aether's flow in a sort of microcosmic system. Technology, in turn, can nurture the natural world, helping life grow and flourish in places and ways that would otherwise be impossible.

Elves who dwell in the forest and countryside are known as the Bishtahar. Most live in isolated communities away from other races, though they still trade with them. In fact, much of Kaladesh's food supply is grown by elves. Bishtahar cultivators grow food, decorative flowers, wood for building, and elaborate living sculptures in their meandering gardens and fields. They use the plane's ubiquitous technology to foster the growth of plants and animals, utilizing automatons as gardeners and herders, and employing elaborate, nearly invisible systems controlling heat, water, and nutrients.
	A garden tended by elves seems to grow naturally in an aesthetically pleasing fashion. In fact, many of the forests and plains of Kaladesh are planted and tended by elves as well. What might appear at first to be wild countryside is more likely a carefully planned landscape designed to meet the needs of the people and animals that live there.
	Elves who forsake technology entirely are called the Tirahar. Some elves with Tirahar sympathies live within cities or farms, but most simply withdraw to the wilder areas of Kaladesh. No more than one in a hundred elves is counted among the Tirahar, and many members of other races are unaware that these reclusive elves even exist.

The Vahadar are elves who dwell in the cities of Kaladesh. They are comfortable with technology, and work as planners, architects, aether-seers, or inventors. Some of them use the techniques of Bishtahar cultivators to grow food on rooftops, towers, and greenways. The Vahadar are generally integrated into the rest of society on Kaladesh, living in cities dominated by the other races (though, as in Ghirapur, many of them live in specific garden-like neighborhoods) and engaging in trade.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>"Of course it's flawed. Everything is. And it's a good thing, too! Can you imagine how dreadful it would be if everything was already perfect?"

Vedalken have an unusual view of progress. They believe that nothing is perfect, nor can it ever be perfect—and they rejoice in this. Every imperfection is a chance for improvement, and progress is an endless march toward a state of perfection that can never actually be reached. Thus, pointing out imperfection is hardly an insult—which leads vedalken to note flaws and problems with an enthusiasm that members of other races sometimes find exasperating.
	This enthusiasm extends to every aspect of vedalken work, both practical and theoretical. They are curious and excitable, and often become deeply engrossed in their labors. It's not uncommon for a vedalken to spend hours on end caught up in the details of an abstract question or a minute engineering problem. Vedalken can be utterly oblivious to their surroundings while meditating on thorny issues, and they are prone to launching into lengthy explanations of their current research, since most find that talking about a problem often leads to a solution.
	As a rule, vedalken are gregarious in conversation. However, they are quite circumspect concerning their personal lives, and they engage more with ideas than with people. They form close friendships based around mutual interests or compelling disagreements, and their interactions focus on their thoughts about those issues rather than their feelings about them. Emotional dynamics don't particularly interest vedalken, either as a conversational topic or a field of study. When they talk about their feelings, it is primarily to provide information that might be helpful to others. For example, a vedalken might tell her colleagues, "I'm feeling irritated right now, so I might not be reacting appropriately. Perhaps we should continue this later." But any questions about the cause of the irritation are likely to be brushed off as being irrelevant to the situation.

All aven have lean bodies with feathers extending from their heads down to their shoulders.
	Aven delight in flying above their foes, using their superior mobility to confound and outpace their opponents. They love soaring through the sky as well, though the Hekma limits their altitude. Like all people of Naktamun, they are grateful for the Hekma's protective magic, of course. But they keenly anticipate the hour when the God-Pharaoh will return and dissolve the veil, letting them fly without limit in the afterlife.

Following the example of Oketra, hawkheaded aven often focus on the techniques of long-range combat. Most prefer javelins, but some are skilled with bows, spears, and throwing axes.

      <text>The khenra of Amonkhet are tall and lean, with graceful bodies and heads that strongly resemble jackals. Their snouts are long and sharp, and their angular ears rise straight above their heads. Their bodies are covered in dark, sleek hair that ranges from the brown of the desert sands to ebony black. Despite their sharp teeth, they consider biting to be an uncouth and unworthy combat tactic.
	Nearly every khenra is born a fraternal or identical twin, and a pair of khenra twins forms an extremely close emotional bond unknown to most other residents of Amonkhet. The death of one twin in training or the trials causes a tremendous shock to the survivor, who typically grows more aggressive and foolhardy in battle. The rare khenra who are born without twins are believed to have killed their siblings in the womb, and are thus viewed as natural-born initiates, sure to achieve a glorified death in the Trial of Zeal.

      <text>Goblins are native to Ixalan, and their eager curiosity drew them to the ships of the Brazen Coalition where the pirates first made landfall on the Sun Empire's shores. Though they still thrive in remote jungle colonies, goblins are most commonly seen swinging on the ropes of sleek pirate ships.
	Goblins stand about three feet tall, though they rarely stand upright. They prefer a crouched posture that lets them scramble quickly on all fours, aided by their long prehensile tails. Their hearing and eyesight make them excellent lookouts, and their agility serves them well as crew members on pirate ships. They climb, swing, and jump easily among a ship's ropes, and can get into tight spaces that humans can't. For better or worse, many goblins are also incorrigible pranksters, and they often have a hard time determining when a prank is inappropriate, is poorly timed, or has gone too far.

They stand between seven and eight feet tall, with skin that ranges from deep burgundy through many shades of violet and blue, to green, bright orange, and yellow. They are humanlike in shape, but have long fins extending from their shoulders, forearms, middle backs, and calves. Frills of fins also protrude from the backs of their heads. All merfolk can breathe air or filter oxygen from the water, and they can walk on land or swim with equal ease.

Blue merfolk often have burgundy or magenta on their faces and chests, with lighter shades of blue and purple elsewhere. Their eyes are red, orange, or blue, and their long, thin, and elegant fins resemble scarves or veils of fine fabric. They swim easily, even upstream, and clamber over rocks and through rapids with ease. They prefer to dwell in shallow waters, but spend a fair amount of time on land as well.

Green merfolk generally have yellow chests and pale green faces, shading to dark blues and purples on their backs and limbs.

      <text>Sirens are at home along the waters of the Stormwreck Sea. They settle on rocky coasts and remote islands, and even on floating piles of kelp. Sirens are mercurial creatures who can turn in an instant from lonely to repulsed, from desirous to hateful, from welcoming to irritated, from loving to murderous—and then back again. They are fascinated with ships, and enjoy toying with them. One siren might call out to a passing crew for company, only to capriciously draw the ship into an entangling mass of kelp. Another might lure a vessel onto jagged rocks so as to study the wreckage and learn more about the strange contraption. But as the number of Brazen Coalition ships passing through siren-controlled waters has increased over the years, a growing number of sirens have decided to satisfy their curiosity by taking positions on ship crews—including, in at least one case, the position of captain.
	Sirens are humanoid creatures with birdlike features. Their long, slender arms extend into powerful wings that easily carry their light frames into the air. Their fingers bear sharp claws but are nimble enough to wield weapons and perform fine manipulation. Crests of feathery plumage start between their eyes and cover the backs of their heads.

      <text>Vampires are associated with necromancy. Their existence is predicated on draining the life from others to fuel their own existence, and on putting their own lives ahead of all other concerns. Philosophically, they do not constrain themselves with artificial rules of morality, but believe that the strong can and should take what they need from the weak.

The Legion of Dusk is dominated by an aristocratic class made up of vampires. They are faster and stronger than most humans, and gifted with supernatural abilities that made them the most formidable force in their homeland. Now, as they push into the depths of Ixalan in search of the Immortal Sun, they bring this strength to bear against all who would resist their advance.
	For many vampires, the Rite of Redemption that transforms a human into a vampire is an act of personal sacrifice, paving the way for a promised glorious age. These vampires embody Torrezon's noble tradition in Ixalan. They are often guided by their dual loyalties to church and crown, believing that the monarch acts with righteous purpose. As such, these vampires carry themselves with a self-assurance that is both imposing and imperial. Other societies seem inferior and unclean compared to their own, leading them to feel that they have a right to claim new lands despite the presence of people already inhabiting those lands.
	Other vampires view vampirism merely as a means to attain a powerful advantage over others. These vampires are fierce, ruthless, and often cruel, relishing conflict—be it political or armed—as a means of demonstrating their superiority. Many are politically ambitious, invoking Torrezon's hierarchy when it serves their interests, but ignoring all the rules of church, state, and morality when those rules become a burden. When these vampires come to Ixalan, they are conquerors, motivated by the prospect of personal glory and the accumulation of riches. Those who achieve wealth and power display it ostentatiously.
	The core of every vampire's nature is the Feast of Blood. Though it is forbidden to feed on human citizens of Torrezon, including the human sailors and servants who accompany the vampire conquistadors to Ixalan, vampires are encouraged to feed on outsiders and heretics. The Feast of Blood sends new life essence flowing through the vampire who partakes of it, manifesting as even greater strength and speed.

      <text>Following the devastation of the distant continent of Otaria in Karona's War some two and a half centuries ago, people of many races left that land to find refuge elsewhere. Among them were the birdlike people called aven, who were largely unknown outside of Otaria prior to their exodus. Rather than dispersing around the world and assimilating into local cultures, they wandered in great flocks, forming separate communities in a few hospitable locations. The largest such flock settled in Benalia, where its people submitted themselves to Benalish law in exchange for hospitality. The aven have no representation on the Council of Seven, but many hope to see that change.
	Aven have humanlike bodies, arms, and legs, along with birdlike wings and heads. Two distinct varieties of aven are found in Naktamun. One has the head of a hawk or similar bird of prey, with short wings allowing fast flight. The other variety has the head of an ibis atop a long neck, with wide, angular wings better suited to soaring. All aven have lean bodies with feathers extending from their heads down to their shoulders.
	Aven delight in flying above their foes, using their superior mobility to confound and outpace their opponents. They love soaring through the sky as well, though the Hekma limits their altitude. Like all people of Naktamun, they are grateful for the Hekma's protective magic, of course. But they keenly anticipate the hour when the God-Pharaoh will return and dissolve the veil, letting them fly without limit in the afterlife.

      <text>The people of Keld are human, but they are like no other humans anywhere. Nearly all adults stand over six feet tall, and heights above seven feet are not uncommon. They are massively muscled and have gray skin, ranging from an ashy gray-white to a deeper bluegray. The typical Keldon's hairline points sharply down in the middle of the forehead and at either temple, but recedes elsewhere—sometimes dramatically. Keldons are remarkably resistant to the cold of their homeland, baring skin even in near-freezing temperatures without discomfort.
	Keldons value self-reliance, strength, and courage above all else. Anything that is the product of their own labor is a fine thing. Anything else is treated with a healthy dose of skepticism. At best, they are a proud, pragmatic, passionate people, and their loyalty is fierce once earned. At worst, they can be reckless, hot-tempered, and violent—and no small number of Keldons still consider these qualities virtues rather than vices.
	Because of their many exploits as both conquerors and mercenaries, Keldons appear in the legends and histories of other peoples across the world. Sometimes these tales are exaggerated—but many that sound exaggerated are not.

This world is a wondrous one and everywhere you go, something new is there to dazzle and amaze!
—Guardian Leafy Skiptoes

Dankwood goblins are much like any other run-of-the-mill goblin but they are much more gentle and artistic than the savage and uncouth goblins of the world.
	They are inquisitive and have a magical bond with the small forest creatures with which they are often friends. They are fast and nimble and love to explore. Because of this they make great adventurers and guides.

Cave bullywugs have made their home in the deep places underground. They tend to be dark brown, olive green, light blue or even pigment-free albinos. Their eyes are pale in color, and their eyesight is adapted to the complete lack of sunlight in underground living. They are excellent scavengers and can survive on meager resources.

The royalty rules according to their attitude and morality, which can range from a friendly monarchy to a hostile dictatorship.

There are a few bullywug towns that are more advanced; some boasting studies in mathematics, physics, metalworking, and engineering.

      <text>Bullywugs survive in many different living conditions: untamed jungles, lush forests, wetlands, and even deep underground. As such, their bodies have also adapted to suit these conditions, producing an incredible amount of variety in size, color, and ability.

Bullywugs usually thrive near water. Their strong legs and long, webbed feet make them wonderful swimmers, but hinder their movement on land. They developed their ability to jump as a result, so they can chase down their quarry, or escape a predator.

Bullywugs can pass air through their throats, filling a flexible membrane that bellows out and amplifies their noise. They can speak with one another up to 500 feet away.</text>

The quest for power is a hallmark of the bullywug social order. Finding power in personal strength, wealth, or magical ability fits in nicely with bullywug aspirations.

      <text>Bullywugs are medium-sized, frog-like humanoids with wet skin, strong legs, and the ability to breathe underwater.

Toad bullywugs are the largest of all bullywugs. Their drab, dry, bumpy skin and bloated features also make them the ugliest of the bullywugs. What they lack in beauty, they make up for in sheer toughness.

      <name>Social Structure</name>
      <text>Bullywug civilizations have a loose class system organized within a tribe-like framework. Warriors, gatherers, tadpole caretakers, shaman, and builders are typical classes in a bullywug society. They are governed by a king or queen, who is usually the largest and strongest of the warrior caste. The royalty rules according to their attitude and morality, which can range from a friendly monarchy to a hostile dictatorship.

There are a few bullywug towns that are more advanced; some boasting studies in mathematics, physics, metalworking, and engineering. There are even rumors of a few bullywug castles guarded by heavily armored knights. Wealthy kings and queens are waited on by servants and peasants, following more feudalistic-like social organization.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Adaptions</name>
      <text>Bullywugs survive in many different living conditions: untamed jungles, lush forests, wetlands, and even deep underground. As such, their bodies have also adapted to suit these conditions, producing an incredible amount of variety in size, color, and ability.

Bullywugs usually thrive near water. Their strong legs and long, webbed feet make them wonderful swimmers, but hinder their movement on land. They developed their ability to jump as a result, so they can chase down their quarry, or escape a predator.

Bullywugs can pass air through their throats, filling a flexible membrane that bellows out and amplifies their noise. They can speak with one another up to 500 feet away.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Reasons to Adventure</name>
      <text>Greed is the compelling reason to adventure. A clanless bullywug feels free to take for themselves, instead of for a king or queen. Initially, their hunger for the accumulation of wealth is ravenous. As they become used to their freedom, this can dissipate. However, some set out to find treasure for their ruler, in the hopes of achieving a higher social rank on their return.

The quest for power is a hallmark of the bullywug social order. Finding power in personal strength, wealth, or magical ability fits in nicely with bullywug aspirations.

There are a few "free thinking" bullywugs who adventure for other reasons, such as giving money to charity, defending friends or their town, or overthrowing local evil.</text>

      <text>Most Ibexi do not care for the pomp and circumstance of fine art and poetry, although they have their own artforms. Rich oral histories recount tales of ancient gods creating them from the stones of the mountains, and elegant dance ceremonies offer fealty to these nature spirits. In their free time, many Ibexis enjoy friendly wrestling matches and footraces, and hold jubilant dances to traditional folk music at least once a month.

Ibexi Sports. Ibexi love to be active, and their enjoy- ment is multiplied exponentially when others join them in their romping pastimes. Favorite activities include the standard stick-pull (though many prefer a variation where you join hooves instead of hold a stick), leg wrestling (the loser is often just as pleased to be thrown as the winner is to win), footbag (which can sometimes go for hours, often with rules conjured on the fly), and "tree-tussles" (where one or two contestants form a "tree" by standing on the shoulders of another, and they try to dismantle the other "trees'' without breaking their own form).
	Usually good natured in their escapades, Ibexi characters will often challenge allies to friendly athletic competitions, and may become sad and unhealthy if they do not experience regular physical activity and bond with others through sport.</text>

      <text>Most races claim to be the creation of some sort of progenitor god. Not the kuo-toa. Much to the awe and horror of every scholar who learns of them, the kuo-toa can create their own gods.

      <text>It is rare that a kuo-toa leaves the safety of its people to strike out as an adventurer. The kuo-toa tend to hate other races, and the feeling is mutual. However, if a kuo-toa can get past its xenophobia, learn to abide sunlight, and agree to observe local laws concerning cannibalism, they can be a strange and unique addition to any party.

2 | You are quick to point out the flaws of everyone around you.
3 | You only talk when waving your hands doesn't do the job.
4 | You assume every rumor of wrongdoing must be true.
5 | You always walk about in your sleep, mumbling about the new god you just discovered.

      <text>Some say that the dead-gray mist began in Metrol, initially flowing out of the royal palaces of Vermishard. Others swear that the disaster began in the Cannith stronghold Making. All that is known is that the mist swiftly spread across the kingdom, transforming the lands and creatures caught within it. Over a million people died in the Mourning, including nearly all of the inhabitants of central Cyre. The mist slowed its advance as it spread, and some of those in the borderlands heard of the disaster in time to flee. Others survived because they were already beyond the borders of Cyre; the mist stopped mere feet away from the camps of Cyran soldiers holding sections of the Brelish front.
	But, as is the case with these types of disasters, a rare few inexplicably survived. These are the Mourntouched. This is you.

Did you find other survivors and form a motley band? Did you come across the followers of the Lord of Blades, who kept you safe from monsters after old warforged friends vouched for your good character? What did you eat and drink? What sorts of terrible scenes did you witness as you trekked to safety?

5 | Your eyes have turned to amber gemstones, with swirling veins of golden light within.
6 | Your skin is translucent and light blue.
7 | You appear completely identical to your previous form, but others feel strange and uncomfortable around you anyways. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of illusion magic about you.
8 | You appear to be of a different race now. You can choose the race or roll on the New Race table to determine which.
9 | You've grown small wings on your back. They are not large enough for flight. You may choose their appearance, such as feathery, scaly, or bat-like.

      <text>Ratpeople are furry, anthropomorphic rodents. Many unfamiliar with the species confuse them for wererats.

      <text>A modron unit sometimes becomes defective, either through natural decay or exposure to chaotic forces.

When such modrons are discovered, Primus likes to meet with them.
	During this meeting, Primus will try them for any crimes committed. These trials are fair, brief, and comprehensive. After the trial, if the modron has been deemed a violent criminal, it is lovingly sent to a rehabilitation clinic. Noncriminal and rehabilitated modrons are given a choice continue to function in modron society as best they can or be given a complete autonomy and humanity. Those who choose humanity undergo a magical transformation of body, mind, and spirit, and often go to the material plane to pursue a life of free agency or to a rogue modron colony on any of the myriad of planes.
	As a peculiar people, rogue modrons have peculiar habits. Going from a life of complete law and order to the neutral mishmash of the material plane is one of the greatest culture shocks in the known multiverse. Many rogue modrons develop unique idiosyncrasies that others may find equally irritating and endearing. The Rogue Modron Quirks table lists examples that can provide inspiration for quirks of your modron characters.

2 | You are unable to recognize your reflection.
3 | You keep small bugs in a hollow compartment in your foot.
4 | You are fluent in Morse code. You have yet to find a plane of existence that uses it.
5 | You are prone to fits of self expression, where you are compelled to draw or paint on the nearest unmoving surface.
6 | You march in place when not moving.
7 | Once per day at random, you eject a small metallic disc.
8 | You have found and keep precious a sex of six polyhedral dice. They remind you of home.

Here are just a few examples of gestures rollic use:

Greeting a Commoner. To greet each other, rollic cross both arms in front of their chest and bow. The right arm goes in front for greetings. The left arm goes in front for farewells.

Greeting a Chieftain. As a sign of respect to their leader, rollic run two fingers across the right side of their forehead. Outsiders often confused this with running two fingers across the left side of their forehead, which is how rollic declare sworn enemies.

Complimenting a Service. After receiving a satisfying meal or other service, rollic gives thanks by inhaling while clicking their tongues exactly six or twelve times, depending on how satisfied the rollic is. Delivering any other number of clicks or exhaling instead or means the meal or service was inadequate in some way.

Requesting Aid. When asking someone for aid, a rollic first places their right hand on the other person's right shoulder, makes direct eye contact, then presses their forehead to the other person's forehead. Outsiders often find such close contact extremely discomforting. Using the other arm or reaching for the wrong shoulder are both insults.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Isolated Origins</name>
      <text>Prejudice against their kind led rollic to retreat into secluded tribes far from other civilizations. When other races come across them, more aggressive tribes might capture and force them to fight in a formal duel before letting them free again. Those victorious in battle who spare their opponent are immediately made friends of the tribe and are offered to be taught their ways. It is difficult to gain the trust of a rollic, but once obtained, they are fiercely loyal.
	Rollic tribes usually live within verdant forests in burrow-like huts or lodges crafted from wood, mud, and plaster. Others are more nomadic, favoring more temporary and mobile structures such as tents and lean-tos.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>For Honor and Tribe</name>
      <text>From birth, rollic are taught that serving the tribe is the only way to achieve true internal and external peace. Even those with little experience will fight to defend and protect. Elders and leaders are to be respected.
	Those who dishonor or betray the tribe's trust, even accidentally, are banished. An ousted rollic will often seek out a way to serve a greater cause or reach a grand achievement that might restore their honor. These rollic will pursue it before all else, and be sure they have evidence to prove their deeds upon their return. Others who feel betrayed by their tribe and their attempts at maintaining honor may abandon it entirely, seeking more chaotic paths and refusing leadership as a way to oppose their past ways.

Reason for Adventuring:
d6 | I left my tribe because...
1 | I cheated in a tribal sporting event and was ousted for my crime.
2 | I was banished for making friends with a sworn enemy of the tribe.
3 | A member of my tribe was killed and I must avenge their death.
4 | An outsider stole a tribal relic and I must retrieve it.
5 | Chasing honor in the tribe left me with nothing. I seek another path.
6 | I was fascinated by outsiders and wanted to brave the unknown</text>

      <name>Names</name>
      <text>Rollic names generally consist with two syllables that start with consonant sounds and end with vowels. They make heavy use of the airy, guttural consonants common in their dialect. Tribe names, when translated, usually reflect the quill color or patterns of the tribe. Elders and leaders of the tribe have three syllables instead.

Rollic Names: Hrolu, Ghrato, Sxerhi, Naxu, Vochna, Buxleh

Rollic Tribes: Black Quill, Red Stripe, Pine Needle, Bark Coat

If an outsider's name doesn't have two syllables, rollic will often adapt their name, removing or adding syllables to make sure it has two.</text>

      <text>Red Elf. Rugged Elf. Were-elf. The Taleyri bear many names, most stemming from confusion and misunder standing. This largely has to do with their appearance, which is unique among the elvish people, for they are built more solidly than their kin. Muscular frames and taller height place them more in the vicinity of humans, but their bodies and faces are covered in soft, red fur, and their prominent canines suggest a far different ancestry. In truth, the Taleyri are even stranger than most people assume, for they are not a true race them selves.
	The Taleyri begin life as regular elves. Indeed, they are elves, indistinguishable from their families and neighbors. Through trance they experience some of their past lives, tied to that eternal flow of reincarnation that is their elven heritage. An elf only becomes one of the Taleyri by undergoing a sacred, transformative rite. This rite must be undertaken willingly, for it takes that elf and all of its past selves and forever removes them from Corellon's cycle of reincarnation. The elf, now one of the Taleyri, is endowed with enhanced strength and supernatural defenses, all the better to defend elven conclaves and other sacred sites.

      <name>Gifts of the Goddess</name>
      <text>Of the creatures that lurk in the night, evil lycanthropes are among the worst. They prey upon the races and spread their vile curse from victim to victim. The patron deity of such monsters, Malar, has a particular hatred for the Seldarine and the elvish people. He once attacked Corellon Larethian in his own home of Arvandor and nearly killed the First of the Seldarine. Malar's failure of that hunt has eaten at him ever since, and he drives his worshipers to hunt elves at every opportunity.
	This enmity prompted Sehanine Moonbow to create the ritual whereby elves could become Taleyri. With greater physical strength and protection against curses, these volunteers could stand toe-to-toe against the raiding lycanthropes. Even when struck down, they could become guardians of knowledge and wisdom as great sentient trees.
	Aside from the newfound strength and red fur, the most important gift the Taleyri receive is a more intimate relationship with their past lives. The Taleyri have no need to trance, for they can commune at any time with their previous selves, though the insight they gain is often clouded or enigmatic. A mortal mind can only hold so much knowledge at one time. Instead, their consciousness goes out to nearby animals and bonds with them, seeing what they see until the Taleyri awaken.</text>

      <text>When one of the Taleyri dies, a strange and wonderful event occurs. From the body sprouts a sapling that will one day become an enormous, sentient tree. Such a tree holds the entire memory of all the original elf's past lives. Some elves would mourn at the thought of being removed from the reincarnation cycle, to have their soul's progress forever halted. The Taleyri, however, see all of this as a noble sacrifice, for each tree becomes a living repository of knowledge and wisdom that benefits all those who come with questions to be answered.</text>

	Kobolds are often dismissed as cowardly, foolish, and weak, but these little reptilian creatures actually have a strong social structure that stresses devotion to the tribe, are clever with their hands, and viciously work together in order to overcome their physical limitations.
	In the kobolds' version of a perfect world, the creatures would be left alone to dig their tunnels and raise the next generation of kobolds, all the while seeking the magic that will free their imprisoned god (see the "Kurtulmak: God of Kobolds" sidebar). In the world they occupy, kobolds are often bullied and enslaved by larger creatures-or, when they live on their own, they are constantly fearful of invasion and oppression. Although individually they are timid and shy away from conflict, kobolds are dangerous if cornered, vicious when defending their eggs, and notorious for the dangerous improvised traps they use to protect their warrens.

	To feel the thunder of orcish war drums outside the gate and to hear a chorus of voices growling, "Gruumsh!" is the nightmare of every civilized place in the world. For no matter how thick its walls, skilled its archers, or brave its knights, few settlements have ever withstood a full-scale onslaught of orcs.
	Every soldier who lives through a fight with orcs tells of confronting a hulking foe that can cleave through a warrior with a single blow, part of a force that can cut down enemies as though they were trembling stalks of wheat before the scythe. Only a skilled and determined hero can hope to survive single combat with an orc.
	Savage and fearless, orc tribes are ever in search of elves, dwarves, and humans to destroy. Motivated by their hatred of the civilized races of the world and their need to satisfy the demands of their deities, the orcs know that if they fight well and bring glory to their tribe, Gruumsh will call them home to the plane of Acheron. It is there in the afterlife where the chosen ones will join Gruumsh and his armies in their endless extraplanar battle for supremacy.

      <text>There are those that exist between two worlds, whose very existence walks a fine line between the Material Plane and the Feywild. The feyblood are a product of the extraordinary union between a powerful fey spirit such as a dryad, sylph, or nereid, and a mortal. While most often mingled with elves or humans, it isn't unheard of for other types of fey and mortals to unite in similar fashion, and from this union, a child may be born with both a mortal coil and a fey spirit.
	Regardless, such unions are extremely rare, and often carry severe punishment for the fey parent. Amongst other races, the feyblood are viewed with suspicion and sometimes fear for the capricious nature of the fey, told throughout the Material Plane.

As a skyborn feyblood, you inherited the powers of the faeries who dwell in the eternal skies. You take great pride in your heritage, and have a keen sense when it comes to dealing with others. You tend to be reclusive and aloof, often studying others from afar before opening yourself to them. You have a dislike of dark, confined spaces.

      <text>Similar to their fey parents, the feyblood share a special connection to their homeland. They too have tendency toward insatiable curiosity and wanderlust, rarely staying in any one place for a lengthy period of time.
	Feyblood aren't vain creatures, but can be mistaken as such. They are drawn to beauty, and often dress themselves in colorful silks and fabrics that lean toward the primordial nature of their parentage. They also delight in wearing unique trinkets that reflect the light of the sun or moon.
	Physically, Feyblood have slim, pointed ears and sharp features. They're slim-framed, often with slender hands and fingers. Their most prominent feature is their semitranslucent gossamer wings, which can vary in shape from butterfly-like to sharp, foliage-like features. They're almost always older than they appear. Even the starkest, most serious stare from a feyblood has a hint of childish playfulness hidden beneath.
	Their hair varies in color, usually anywhere from dusty blonde to deep browns and greens for the earthborn dryashi, or white, gray, silver, and shades of blues and browns for the skyborn sylphi. Their eyes are usually wider than normal, with colors varying between browns, greens, and reds.

      <text>Because of their spiritual duality, the feyblood are caught between two worlds, neither of which accept them as true kin. Most fey view them as abominations, only rarely providing aid or guidance to those deemed to be a lesser species. They are only slightly more accepted amongst their other non-fey kin, though never entirely able to fit or be fully accepted into their world. Certain races are more accepting than others. Elves treat feyblood very much like other half-elves, for example, while gnomes are far more curious as to their shared connection with their fey kin.

The feyblood are a product of the extraordinary union between a powerful fey spirit such as a dryad, sylph, or nereid, and a mortal. While most often mingled with elves or humans, it isn't unheard of for other types of fey and mortals to unite in similar fashion, and from this union, a child may be born with both a mortal coil and a fey spirit.
	Regardless, such unions are extremely rare, and often carry severe punishment for the fey parent. Amongst other races, the feyblood are viewed with suspicion and sometimes fear for the capricious nature of the fey, told throughout the Material Plane.

You have a spiritual connection with the land and sea. With such a strong bond, you feel a sense of kinship with all living creatures. You tend to be friendly toward others, sometimes in excess. You are tough, energetic, and lively, often holding contempt for things akin to decay and corruption.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Spirit of the Wild</name>
      <text>Similar to their fey parents, the feyblood share a special connection to their homeland. They too have tendency toward insatiable curiosity and wanderlust, rarely staying in any one place for a lengthy period of time.
	Feyblood aren't vain creatures, but can be mistaken as such. They are drawn to beauty, and often dress themselves in colorful silks and fabrics that lean toward the primordial nature of their parentage. They also delight in wearing unique trinkets that reflect the light of the sun or moon.
	Physically, Feyblood have slim, pointed ears and sharp features. They're slim-framed, often with slender hands and fingers. Their most prominent feature is their semitranslucent gossamer wings, which can vary in shape from butterfly-like to sharp, foliage-like features. They're almost always older than they appear. Even the starkest, most serious stare from a feyblood has a hint of childish playfulness hidden beneath.
	Their hair varies in color, usually anywhere from dusty blonde to deep browns and greens for the earthborn dryashi, or white, gray, silver, and shades of blues and browns for the skyborn sylphi. Their eyes are usually wider than normal, with colors varying between browns, greens, and reds. Their skin tones are similar to humans, but there are instances of some with greenish or bluish hues mixed within.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Good Heart and Brave Soul</name>
      <text>While often viewed by others with great suspicion, feyblood still hold a love of life and strive to see the good in others whenever possible. They are far from being foolish in this aspect, however. Though they usually share a dislike for violence, they're staunch protectors of others, particularly those that also share an affinity for nature. They tend to keep only a few trusted friends and allies, though their loyalty to those chosen few is indisputable.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Opposing Natures</name>
      <text>Because of their spiritual duality, the feyblood are caught between two worlds, neither of which accept them as true kin. Most fey view them as abominations, only rarely providing aid or guidance to those deemed to be a lesser species. They are only slightly more accepted amongst their other non-fey kin, though never entirely able to fit or be fully accepted into their world. Certain races are more accepting than others. Elves treat feyblood very much like other half-elves, for example, while gnomes are far more curious as to their shared connection with their fey kin. This is one of the main reasons why feyblood aren't often found in crowded places or areas of large public display.</text>

      <name>Feyblood Names</name>
      <text>Feyblood use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to captures their heritage, and often begin and end with a vowel.

Sample Female Names: Azema, Dedreve, Ephissa, Hathuni, Iaseli, Nesia, Othesni, Sheaya, Ulosani, Zesne

Sample Male Names: Asezur, Cuyel, Eanoo, Fephil, Hivelo, Ilnavi, Kyves, Lissio, Omyth, Salire, Zeyul</text>

tieflings born in the gothic city are severed from their devilish origins, their blood becoming tied to something far more sinister.
	Called "accursed" due to their monstrous appearance, they are feared by most, and their powers envied by nearly as many, letting their jealousy morph into hatred;
an accursed existence indeed. These tieflings possess a fraction of the power of their dark mother's boundless reproduction and are incapable of creating life, though they can create figments of it, with the most powerful capable of creating ephemeral copies of themselves to fight in battle. These tieflings never stay in the city for long, vanishing shortly after reaching adulthood.

      <text>The cursed-blood are so named for their accursed lineage, forever bound by the twisted tethers of their very own blood. From the moment of their birth, they are each adorned with a quiescent mask, sealing their features in a permanent expression of cold, unfeeling marble. Nevertheless, these fated beings find strength in the familial bonds that tie them together, for they must rely on each other to survive the foul scourge that has befallen Luyarnha.
	Alas, the cursed-blood are shunned and abhorred throughout the city-state, only finding refuge far from the prying eyes of society, amidst the squalor of the city's slums. In these desolate corners, where madness and scourge ravage the populace, the cursed-blood stand vigilant, ever protective of their own kin, finding solace in their shared bane.
	The cursed-bloods' origins are viewed as a taboo subject not to be spoken of by the populace, to avoid incurring the wrath of those above. According to whispered rumors, the curse was a punishment meted out by vengeful Great Ones, a retribution for sins committed by their forebears. Once, their kin—demons, dragons, and other creatures of flame and brimstone—roamed freely across the world, but they have long since disappeared, banished from existence by the enigmatic beings that lurk in the glacial void beyond. Now, all who share even a drop of their blood are condemned to a wretched existence, their individual origins erased and replaced by the familial bond they forged from the crucible of their affliction.
	This curse, wrought from birth, is both tragic and horrific. Each born as conjoined twins, one of them must inevitably perish for the other to live. Although the death of their twin happens in the womb, the cursed-blood can still hear and feel the echoes of their lost sibling's voice within their own soul. This unspeakable atrocity against life twists their flesh and soul, and forces them to carry the remnants of their other half within their chest in the form of a gaping maw, an eye, or some other feature over which they have no control.

Although all cursed-bloods view each other as family, depending on their origin—draconic, infernal, or otherwise—their flesh has evolved in various ways.

As a doused cursed-blood, the blood of dragons flows within your veins. Your body is more reptilian, with scales of the same color as your draconic ancestors, elongated claws, and a fierce gaze behind your mask.

      <text>Your dead twin manifests on your body in one of the following ways of your choice:

	• Chest Maw. The mouth on your abdomen can devour many things, temporarily storing them in a pocket dimension within you. It can hold up to 250 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 32 cubic feet. If you fall unconscious or die, you harmlessly regurgitate all materials in your maw. Breathing creatures inside your maw can survive up to 1 minute, after which time they begin to suffocate. After 24 hours inside your body, a nonmagical item is destroyed, consumed by your body. If it is a magic item, a creature, or a corpse, you regurgitate it instead. Starting at 5th level, you can store materials indefinitely (but still not while unconscious or dead), and the dimension's volume and weight it can hold doubles.

	• Heedful Eye. As long as the eye in your chest is open, you have darkvision out to 120 feet. You can cast detect magic once while the eye is open, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest. Starting at 5th level, you can cast see invisibility once while the eye is open, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can open the eye as a bonus action, and close it at will (no action required).

	• Gaping Remain. Ripped out of your chest, due to your will or perhaps your twin's, it now only exists within you in spirit, capable of influencing the world through you.

	• You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see, provided the creature is within a number of feet of you equal to five times your level. The voice the creature hears isn't yours, but that of your twin. The telepathic speech is made in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Starting at 5th level, the creature is able to telepathically respond to you in a language it knows.

	• You learn the mage hand cantrip. You can cast it without any somatic or verbal components, and the hand has the appearance of your twin's. Your spellcasting ability for the spell is Charisma.</text>

As a mirage cursed-blood, your infernal legacy is apparent.

      <text>Easily distinguished by their eyes—brightly colored irises that swirl like galaxies in a jet-black sclera—demidritch occupy a precarious precipice in the minds of Luyarnhians, equal parts revered and abhorred. Born of a union between humanoids and eldritch beings, demidritch are often referred to as 'half-angels, a misnomer arising from Luyarnhians' mistaken belief that these creatures are descended from celestials. Stories abound of radiant silhouettes-eldritch creatures wreathed in powerful illusions-appearing unto pregnant Luyarnhians and blessing their progeny with otherworldly powers.
	While the Radiant Church espouses no stance on the morality of such beings, elements amongst their ranks, most notably the bookish Obitus Scholare, prize the demidritch as precious specimens that may provide the key to humanity's survival. The deeds of the righteous demidritch Aitzaz, a first hunter and close friend of Steinhardt, are widely recounted by bards and minstrels across the city. His death at the hands of the ravenous scourge while evacuating schoolchildren precipitated a shift in the treatment of demidritch by Luyarnhians. Though they may have otherworldly origins, the alignment of demidritch, like most humanoids, is a product of their environment and upbringing

Depending on their lineage, demidritchs have different subraces, which represent their variation. The DC for abilities given by the subraces is equal to 8 + twice your proficiency bonus.

Also called observers, the many-eyed, and watchers, oculare always possess a greater allocation of eyes than one might expect. Commoners often describe the feeling of being watched when in the presence of oculare; in fact, such individuals commonly find themselves in the employ of the militia or church as investigators, their natural perceptiveness giving them a keen advantage.

      <name>Origin</name>
      <text>The act of childbearing is, in itself, a heroic endeavor that women courageously undertake, placing their bodies at risk to ensure the perpetuation of their lineage into the distant future. In most societies, this sacred act has been revered; yet, within the confines of Luyarnha, it can assume an unsettling guise. In this city, certain women find themselves beset by nightmares, only to awaken and, within mere days, experience the telltale nausea of pregnancy, despite their unblemished chastity: blessed by the offspring of a Higher Poweror so it is believed.
	While some regard this union as a divine blessing, it cruelly prevents the expecting mother from ever establishing a family, for the demidritch offspring rends the womb asunder with their foreign constitution during birth. Should the trauma not be swiftly attended to, the mother's life can meet an abrupt end. In response, the church has taken to gathering those who exhibit this miraculous conception to ensure their safety during labor and to exert a modicum of control over the potent half-divine progeny.
	For some women, particularly those of faith or those deemed unworthy of love, the prospect of receiving this so-called blessing is welcomed. Such a union would grant them sanctuary within the church's protective walls for the remainder of their lives, offering them the semblance of a family they might not have otherwise known, however fractured it may be. Yet, others are repulsed by this fate and seek to defy it, often with tragic results. Those who reject the church's embrace might give birth in forsaken alleyways, casting their children away or consigning them to orphanages. A fortunate few, perhaps bolstered by exceptional financial fortitude or familial support, succeed in bearing their offspring and providing them with as normal a childhood as Luyarnha's grim circumstances allow.
	This enigmatic phenomenon has left even the most erudite scholars utterly perplexed. It is widely accepted that the Great Ones are incapable of procreation, and yet. Various theories have been postulated in an attempt to fathom the origins of these peculiar offspring—some conjecture that they serve as beacons, as the Great Ones disseminate their consciousness across the vast reaches of the cosmos, with fragments ultimately embedding themselves within the bodies of these unsuspecting mothers; consequently, the resulting progeny would function as a beacon to draw the Great Ones nearer to the world—others suggest that, due to their intrinsic sterility, the Great Ones crave a surrogate through which to vicariously experience creation. However, the motives of these enigmatic entities are, by their very nature, inscrutable to the mortal mind, and any attempt to decipher their intentions is inherently constrained and flawed.</text>

      <text>Easily distinguished by their eyes—brightly colored irises that swirl like galaxies in a jet-black sclera—demidritch occupy a precarious precipice in the minds of Luyarnhians, equal parts revered and abhorred. Born of a union between humanoids and eldritch beings, demidritch are often referred to as 'half-angels, a misnomer arising from Luyarnhians' mistaken belief that these creatures are descended from celestials. Stories abound of radiant silhouettes-eldritch creatures wreathed in powerful illusions-appearing unto pregnant Luyarnhians and blessing their progeny with otherworldly powers.
	While the Radiant Church espouses no stance on the morality of such beings, elements amongst their ranks, most notably the bookish Obitus Scholare, prize the demidritch as precious specimens that may provide the key to humanity's survival. The deeds of the righteous demidritch Aitzaz, a first hunter and close friend of Steinhardt, are widely recounted by bards and minstrels across the city. His death at the hands of the ravenous scourge while evacuating schoolchildren precipitated a shift in the treatment of demidritch by Luyarnhians. Though they may have otherworldly origins, the alignment of demidritch, like most humanoids, is a product of their environment and upbringing

Depending on their lineage, demidritchs have different subraces, which represent their variation. The DC for abilities given by the subraces is equal to 8 + twice your proficiency bonus.

Beneath the translucent skin of the nebulare flit constellations of multihued lights: galaxy—like swirls and nebulous clouds. In times of great peril, these colorful displays can erupt in a supernova—like display of radiant brilliance, creating localised gravitational fields that help ensure the escape, and continued proliferation, of the nebular demidritch.
	Though the progenitor of the nebulare, an Outer God, has created no new nabulare for some time, the bloodline can go dormant for several generations, manifesting seemingly at random among newborns. Of course, with the Radiant Church experimentation in full swing, whether or not the recurrence of nebulare is really at random is an unanswered question.

      <name>Origin</name>
      <text>The act of childbearing is, in itself, a heroic endeavor that women courageously undertake, placing their bodies at risk to ensure the perpetuation of their lineage into the distant future. In most societies, this sacred act has been revered; yet, within the confines of Luyarnha, it can assume an unsettling guise. In this city, certain women find themselves beset by nightmares, only to awaken and, within mere days, experience the telltale nausea of pregnancy, despite their unblemished chastity: blessed by the offspring of a Higher Poweror so it is believed.
	While some regard this union as a divine blessing, it cruelly prevents the expecting mother from ever establishing a family, for the demidritch offspring rends the womb asunder with their foreign constitution during birth. Should the trauma not be swiftly attended to, the mother's life can meet an abrupt end. In response, the church has taken to gathering those who exhibit this miraculous conception to ensure their safety during labor and to exert a modicum of control over the potent half-divine progeny.
	For some women, particularly those of faith or those deemed unworthy of love, the prospect of receiving this so-called blessing is welcomed. Such a union would grant them sanctuary within the church's protective walls for the remainder of their lives, offering them the semblance of a family they might not have otherwise known, however fractured it may be. Yet, others are repulsed by this fate and seek to defy it, often with tragic results. Those who reject the church's embrace might give birth in forsaken alleyways, casting their children away or consigning them to orphanages. A fortunate few, perhaps bolstered by exceptional financial fortitude or familial support, succeed in bearing their offspring and providing them with as normal a childhood as Luyarnha's grim circumstances allow.
	This enigmatic phenomenon has left even the most erudite scholars utterly perplexed. It is widely accepted that the Great Ones are incapable of procreation, and yet. Various theories have been postulated in an attempt to fathom the origins of these peculiar offspring—some conjecture that they serve as beacons, as the Great Ones disseminate their consciousness across the vast reaches of the cosmos, with fragments ultimately embedding themselves within the bodies of these unsuspecting mothers; consequently, the resulting progeny would function as a beacon to draw the Great Ones nearer to the world—others suggest that, due to their intrinsic sterility, the Great Ones crave a surrogate through which to vicariously experience creation. However, the motives of these enigmatic entities are, by their very nature, inscrutable to the mortal mind, and any attempt to decipher their intentions is inherently constrained and flawed.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>In the days of the First War, an era that marked the initial curiosity of myriad nations towards Luyarnha, a scattering of Dwarves from far-flung reaches of the world found themselves irresistibly drawn to this beleaguered city, a crucible of turmoil and devastation. Amongst those who joined the cause, the majority were mercenaries, whilst others were noble souls seeking to lend aid, and finally a few harbored ambitions of extracting wealth from the faltering nation. As the tides of war shifted, those Dwarves who had chosen to engage in the struggle were offered homes and gold in gratitude for their service, persuading many to remain, forever entwining their destinies with that of the city. The few families that had settled in Luyarnha commenced the trade of precious ores, using their connection to their homeland and harnessing the sophisticated railway system already in place there, thus expanding it within the very walls of the city-state.

Far removed from the splendorous halls of their ancestral kingdoms, the dwarves of Luyarnha have undergone a profound transformation, the likes of which none of their kin foresaw. These once grand merchants perpetrated a sin—coveting that which was not rightfully theirs—and for this dereliction of morality, they begot a curse of unspeakable malevolence, condemning their blood to the compelled service of He Who Lies Dreaming.

      <name>The Cardinal Sin</name>
      <text>"Thou shalt not steal," a dwarven tenet as ancient as their race itself, yet one that an unfortunate number amongst their kin failed to honor. In their homeland, theft was deemed a cardinal sin, punishable to the utmost extent of their laws, at times even by death. Those dwarves harboring avaricious desires deep within, biding their time for the perfect moment to sin unpunished, saw their opportunity amidst the war-torn Luyarnha. Concealed within the ranks of their wellintentioned brethren, they entered Luyarnha only to scatter, some swept away by the tide of war, but those who survived coalesced into marauding bands preying upon the vulnerable. Their plundering persisted until they dared to trespass upon a dwelling that should have remained undisturbed, its walls etched with an archaic language, and its occupant patiently awaiting their intrusion. Unwittingly, they had captured the attention of an entity far more formidable than they could fathom. On that ill-fated day, the lives of these dwarves were irrevocably altered, as they metamorphosed into the Y'ha-nthlei, the enigmatic Deep Ones, a destiny far grimmer than death.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>The Long Night</name>
      <text>A multitude of dwarves had chosen to dwell within the Waterfront district, where the ships dock lay, their shared culture fostering a harmonious coexistence. In a mutually beneficial relationship, they imbued the district with distinct dwarven elements, adding to the gothic architectural landscape and bequeathing the area with a unique aesthetic that endures to this day.
	Yet, the enigmatic Deep Ones, though but a minority amongst Luyarnha's dwarven populace, insidiously encroached upon the Waterfront district. They renounced their thieving ways and instead, embarked upon a sinister campaign of abduction, forcibly indoctrinating their unsuspecting brothers into the worship of their slumbering sovereign, slowly corrupting the inherent goodness that once thrived within the district's walls.
	One fateful night, the Deep Ones executed a vast, coordinated kidnapping, spiriting away hundreds of dwarves in the span of a single, darkened eve — the Long Night. Wanted posters soon plastered the city streets, while the cursed bloods and scions marshaled their forces, and the church dispatched their hunters, all determined to unearth the truth behind the sudden, inexplicable vanishings. And, as mysteriously as they had vanished, the dwarves reappeared, slumbering upon the shoreline, fragrant with the potent aroma of alcohol. The House of Blood's interrogations yielded naught, and soon town criers announced the incident a grand dwarven celebration of the new lunar year, characterized by inebriation and disorientation, leaving the dwarves with no clear memory of the events. Yet from that day forth, a heightened presence of hunters and wardens patrol the district, either to impart a sense of security or, perhaps, because those in authority are privy to some unsettling secret.
	Ever since, the dwarves of Luyarnha have felt a disquieting shift in their lives. Though many remain untouched by the insidious corruption of the Deep Ones' cult, blissfully ignorant of its existence, uncertainty lingers in the air as to how long this fragile equilibrium will endure, before another Long Night befall the remnants of dwarvenkind within Luyarnha, reducing them to nothing but enslaved thralls.</text>

      <name>Raiders To Smugglers</name>
      <text>The Scions, scientists skilled in melding life through electricity to craft manikins and other constructs, grew increasingly reliant upon trade, their experiments demanding gold, mithril and other alloys capable of withstanding the forces of lightning. Yet, as the Scourge surged anew and Luyarnha was once more besieged, the Scions found themselves in dire straits, the resources essential to their groundbreaking research now perilously scarce.
	In this desperate hour, the Y'ha-nthlei emerged, their singular mastery of smuggling enabling them to procure vital materials from beyond the beleaguered city. Young Deep Ones, proficient in navigation and seamanship, who retained greater control over their faculties, could alone navigate the hazardous routes into and out of Luyarnha, defying the lockdown imposed on the city. These enigmatic dwarves proved invaluable to the Scions, and in exchange for their services, the Y'hanthlei furthered their inscrutable goals, burrowing ever deeper into the city's fabric, drawing the unwitting populace closer to the unfathomable depths of their eldritch master's influence.
	Owing to the secretive nature of the Deep Ones and the waning number of "ordinary" dwarves, the race is seen less frequently by the city's denizens. Although they continue to trade and offer their expertise in architectural planning and resource gathering, these skills diminished in importance as the Scourge expanded. Many dwarves adapted their inherent talents to farming, their stout physique ideally suited for laboring within the town's greenhouses, striving alongside others to produce sustenance for the populace. A handful of thrill-seeking dwarves enlisted in the ranks of the hunters, unfortunately a sizeable portion of battle-hardened dwarves unburdened by scruples have already fallen under the thrall of the Y'hanthlei, now toiling to fulfill the sinister objectives of their eldritch master rather than fighting for freedom.</text>

If you are targeting a creature you are grappling, the damage die becomes a d10 instead. You cannot use this arm to make any precise hand manipulation.

      <text>With a touch of gold, a breath of lightning, and hours of meticulous welding and articulation, a manikin is 'born'. Often called 'marionettes' or living dolls', these creatures were originally the creations of the Scions, a Luyarnhian sect who seek to craft a force capable of protecting the city. Though each manikin looks different—indeed, they can resemble any race—the thin golden stitching that joins the plates of their artificial skin is a giveaway that the creature is a manmade creation.

Made to entertain, thespians bring joy to nobles, the clergy, and commoners alike. The only type of manikin designed without lethal intent, these manikins' bodies are supported by invisible, intangible strings, allowing them to move seemingly in defiance of physics. As the plague worsened, the Scions bent their will to producing manikins capable of combating the Scourge, and so the number of thespians has steadily dwindled.

      <name>Free Will</name>
      <text>Inscribed on human eyes inside their skulls are the instructions which all manikin obey. More often than not, this includes a safety system that ensures adherence to the law and prevents a manikin turning on their master. In some cases, a crafter might even cause the manikin to feel love for their creator. Conceived as animate objects capable of carrying out the instructions, manikin who express thoughts of self-liberation are often disposed of before these thoughts turn into acts. Though the Scions intentions were initially noble, playing god has given them a taste for power and they have no intention of granting free will to their animated servants.</text>

	Their curse has taken all the most twisted aspects of their personality and laid them bare for the whole world to see. They wear this disfigured appearance every day;

	Many view this Eldritch revelation as a curse - a curse that drives one to slip deeper and deeper into the depths of depravity until nothing but the monster remains. Yet, many refuse to let it break them - with their innermost darkness now visible, they have no choice but to accept it. It is said that accepting a fault is the first step in correcting it. Those scourgeborne who embrace their inner monster, but refuse to let it rule them, often become messianic heroes within the walls of Luyarnha, attempting to redeem the entire world with their actions, and perhaps one day, themselves.

Your subrace is dictated by an eldritch curse, which doesn't seem to follow a clear reasoning, although it seems that whatever aspect of your personality is most depraved will influence the beast that emerges.

The person who schemes and creates a web of lies around themselves is, unsurprisingly, bound to turn into an aranea. Also known as half-spiders, these scourgeborne differ from others—though many turn, few retain their sanity. Amongst the scourgeborne, araneas are the least trusted, their appearance revealing their former—or current—manipulative personality. Although most citizens understand the need for violence, especially in Luyarnha, none tolerate deception and betrayal.

The rarest amongst the scourgeborne. To become a cervus, also called half-deer or waldschrat, one must have committed the foulest of sins—devouring the flesh of their kin. Or so the rumor went. This urban legend has long since been disproved as many of the town's most trusted figures have turned into such creatures. Interestingly, it seems that those that become cervus are the most apt at fighting creatures of the night, an achievement that earns them the respect of hunters across the city-state.

Those who hid in fear in the face of adversity are cursed to become these beasts of the night. Vespertilio—also known as half-bats—present some of the most accursed beings amongst the scourgeborne. Their unwillingness to see their problems has taken a literal form as most of their sight was stolen from them. Instead, they received half broken wings in a cruel farce of fate, as if to run away from their problems. Yet those who harness these new powers can become some of the fiercest hunters—an act of defiance against fate itself.

Engaging with penumbral creatures is an inherent part of their journey to promote new experiences and combat the forces of darkness.
	Summer elves are particularly drawn to the company of humans, finding their constant change and strong emotions captivating. They often live and travel between human cities, embracing their dynamic nature and thriving in their diverse communities. This proximity leads to most of the half-elves in Tanares being half-summer elves, a testament to the deep connection formed between them.
	As natural wanderers, many summer elves become traders and merchants. Their deity, Òigridh, views trade as an act that brings happiness to both parties involved, considering it an essential means of spreading positivity and weakening the Ungods. In their travels, summer elves explore new experiences, including diverse forms of art, unique individuals, captivating music, and exotic drinks. They often establish connections and relationships with various cultures, enriching their knowledge and understanding of the world.
	Summer elves typically exhibit darker skin tones and beautiful black hair, often kept long and styled in intricate ways. Their attire is as exuberant and expressive as their personalities, frequently featuring fine, vibrant clothing that showcases their love for art and emotion. This striking appearance reflects their inner passion and the vivacity they infuse into every aspect of their lives.

      <text>The spring elves of Tanares are a deeply spiritual and dedicated group, entrusted with the critical task of caring for the ten remaining Mother Trees in the Sindile Forest. These mighty trees, originally twelve in number, are essential to maintaining balance in the world, as they filter out negative emotions and combat the corruptive influence of the Ungods.
	The health and color of the Mother Trees serve as a visual indicator of the world's level of corruption. As the trees darken, the spring elves know that it's time to perform rituals using rare herbs and their unique druidic magic. These cleansing ceremonies purify the trees, enabling them to continue their vital work of filtering out corruption.
	Spring elves have round facial features, and their hair is usually brown or dark blond. They are shorter and slimmer but possess more strength than meets the eye.
	Spring elves are led by the Guardians, an elite group of warriors dedicated to defending their home forest. These skilled archers boast exceptional camouflage abilities, blending seamlessly into their surroundings. Some Guardians wield powerful arrows crafted from the branches of the Mother Trees, imbuing their attacks with potent mystical energy. All of their weapons are made from the enchanted wood found only in Sindile.
	In addition to their guardianship duties, spring elves cultivate and nurture the trees that grow in the presence of the Mother Trees. This special care results in the creation of enchanted wood, a resilient and magical material with a wide range of applications. From weapons and shields to ships and buildings, this enchanted wood enables the construction of items far stronger and more durable.

Particularly skilled in abjuration, illusion, and wind magic, these elves have honed their abilities to create intricate wards and magically enchanted pylons, setting them apart from other elven subcultures.
	Autumn elves typically possess regal, stern features that convey their sense of nobility and seriousness. With sharp, angular facial structures, they exude an air of authority and wisdom, reflecting their dedication to the magic pursuit and their serious belief in noblesse oblige.
	Their advanced magical prowess has enabled the autumn elves to construct entire flying cities, which showcase their exceptional talent in manipulating reality. By employing arrays of illusions, they can create tangible mirages, that can be touched or used as real objects, that can defy the laws of physics, provide individuals with the power of flight through illusory wings, and even conjure mythical servant creatures that possess combat capabilities.
	To maintain their cities' unique defenses and magical constructs, autumn elves must periodically shift their cities to the Penumbral Plane and harvest mystical energy from penumbral creatures. Elite groups of mystical knights, often supported by mercenaries and adventurers, are tasked with this vital responsibility.
	Aibidh, the Lord of Autumn and King of Wind, bestows the most accomplished mystical knights with stormbirds as their steeds. These elemental creatures of the storm serve as loyal and powerful mounts, further enhancing the noble warriors' combat prowess and ability to navigate the treacherous Penumbral Plane.

      <text>The winter elves and the kemets, two factions of the same species, share a common origin but differ in their goals and beliefs. Their dark, grayish, or purple skin and contrasting white hair complement their incredible strength, which belies their slender frames. Their proud, cold, and obstinate demeanor reflects their advanced culture, characterized by patience, wisdom, and an acceptance of death.
	The Elf Migrations led these beings to settle in the frigid region of Reginheraht, where they became known as winter elves. They sought power and knowledge to purify their goddess Bás of corruption and restore her benevolent nature. This quest led them to explore various planes, including the Penumbral Plane, where dark entities manipulated them. The winter elves discovered a prophecy foretelling the world's end at the hands of the Ungods, stating that the kemets must conquer the world to prevent this fate. Desperate and recognizing elements of the prophecy in their reality, they changed their name to kemets and resolved to fulfill the prophecy.
	The kemets adopted a militaristic society, subjugating the Kepesh people from the continent of Darkall and seizing their necromantic knowledge. They organized themselves into family clans dwelling in pyramid-shaped structures, symbolizing their mastery over death. The use of undead became commonplace, from menial tasks in their cities to military operations.
	Centuries after conquering Darkall, the kemets invaded Tanares, expecting victory and prophecy fulfillment. However, their invasion failed, and they spiraled into despair, resigned to the world's inevitable end. Bás, the goddess of winter and death, offered them another path. While some kemets deserted, many joined Bás' cult, seeking to create a realm of eternal ice and undeath, impervious to the Ungods' corruption.
	Conversely, those kemets who repented after the war reverted to being called winter elves. Led by Baraelmer, they aim to redeem the kemets and restore Bás' benevolence. They continue to practice necromancy and employ undead, but now honor the dead by only using the bodies of those who permit it after death.
	Baraelmer's winter elves assist the Republic in defending the coasts against the kemet's undead-powered fleet, stationed in the Storm Islands. Their expertise in naval warfare and newly rediscovered water elementalism helps to counter the kemet's advantage at sea.

      <name>Culture of Necromancy</name>
      <text>Only twenty years ago, the winter elves and kemets were a single, united group. However, the failure of the Kemet Invasion caused a schism that split them into distinct factions. Despite this separation, both groups share core cultural traits deeply rooted in necromancy and mastery over death, a knowledge they stole from the Kepesh.
	The living and the undead coexist seamlessly in their cities. Undead horses pull wagons, and mindless undead perform menial tasks like cleaning or guarding locations. This integration into daily life demonstrates how both factions have overcome the fear of death. Moreover, the undead serve a crucial role in their military, forming the backbone of infantry troops. Their emotionless nature and the lack of families and loved ones prevent the Ungods from gaining power when the undeads are destroyed in battle, making them excellent troops to reduce the chances of a Malrokian Curse cataclysm.
	Both winter elves and kemets organize themselves into clan-based societies. Prominent clans reside in massive pyramid-shaped buildings, which serve as both residences and bureaucratic centers. A hierarchy extends from the ancient Patriarchs and Matriarchs at the summit to lower-ranking members at the base, where public offices and accessible areas can be found.
	Though the winter elves and kemets have diverged in beliefs and goals, their necromantic practices remain a key element of their cultures. The winter elves, now allied with the Republic of Freelands, are relearning their ancient water elementalism and using their necromancy and naval knowledge to battle Gullog's forces. They have recently formed a close bond with the Celestianist clerics of Bauron to exchange information on undead control and elimination. Conversely, the kemets embrace the evil tainted ice elementalism, wielding it to empower their undead hordes. Their shared foundation in necromancy continues to shape both factions, even as they carve out unique paths in the aftermath of the Kemet Invasion.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Bearers of two souls and two personalities, these angel-like beings organize themselves in knightly orders dedicated to eradication of the Ungods and to accomplish their divine calling.

 "We do not hail from the heavens, yet we carry a celestial man date. We have savored the bliss of serenity and divine favor, as well as the harshness of adversity and decay. As each sun rises, we venture into fresh encounters and acquire precious insights that we ought to cherish and impart. Just as a single feather cannot take flight, but a pair can, dual spirits must unite to uncover that which remains hidden from plain sight."
- Zafara, Elder of the Order of Celestial Balance.

In a realm beset by insidious corruption, the cirrus arise as unwavering guardians against the relentless encroachment of malevolence. These celestial-like beings, akin to angels, captivate with their clear blue skin and the majestic wings of their elders. The cirrus embodies the duality of arcane and divine forces, as two souls meld within a single form, intertwining the stark contrast of light and darkness into an unbreakable bond.
	Held together by honor, the cirrus adhere to a stringent code of chivalry and virtues, each exemplified by the unique orders of the Zephyr Knights. These orders represent the cirrus' unfaltering commitment to the essential principles bestowed by the gods, forging a unified front against the otherworldly monstrosities known as the Ungods.
	To the cirrus, the dichotomy of arcane and divine magic transcends mere choice in spellcasting, representing the very essence of their duality. Arcane symbolizes logic, reality, and physicality, while divine signifies wisdom, spirituality, and transcendence. This harmonious equilibrium permeates every facet of their lives, shaping their beliefs and guiding their actions in the ceaseless battle against the forces of insanity emanating from the Penumbral Plane.
	The unity of all Zephyr Knight Orders, distinguished by unique colors and virtues, forges the cirrus into an indomitable force against the Ungods. Through their mastery of arcane and divine energies, they display an unrivaled command of magic, reinforced by their unfaltering dedication to their cause. Amidst adversity, the cirrus stand strong, their unity forming an impervious bulwark against the corrupt ing influence of the Ungods. Though their various knightly orders may harbor diverse opinions and occasionally clash, the Zephyr Knights remain united in their battle against the sinister eldritch beings.
	The celestial nature of the cirrus transcends mere aesthetics; it instills within them an innate sense of purpose, guiding their crusade against the encroaching darkness. As embodiments of balance and harmony, they comprehend the significance of divine order and strive to reestablish equilibrium where corruption seeks to take root. In their youth, each cirrus experiences a divine revelation, imbued with a virtue they must embody and pursue throughout their lives. This revelation directs their path, and the majority join a Zephyr Knight order aligned with their bestowed virtue. Cirrus who abstain from joining an order at adulthood become outcasts, living in exile from their kin and seeking their life's meaning independently. Some reject their calling, while others embrace it further, believing their destiny lies beyond the preconceptions and dogmatism of the orders.
	Their foes, the abhorrent Ungods, represent a desecration of existence, a force the cirrus have vowed to eliminate. These extraplanar deities radiate a corrupting influence, intent on unraveling the fabric of reality and heralding an age of mad ness. Against this unfathomable menace, the cirrus stand resolute, united under the banners of their knight orders and driven by the unwavering conviction of ultimate triumph.

      <name>Cirrus History</name>
      <text>In the dawn of the Godly Age, when angelic hands aid ed sculpting the foundations of creation, the cirrus species emerged—blessed with celestial grace by the angels and entrusted to share the divine word among mortals. However, destiny's path twisted, and they were summoned to war against the looming darkness of the Ungods. As the Ungod Invasion began, the cirrus mustered their unwavering faith and resisted the malevolent tide. Yet, faith alone proved insufficient; they were driven to forge weapons, establish knightly orders, and ultimately, unravel the enigmas of magic and wizardry. Thus, the cirrus unveiled their true potential, merging arcane prowess with divine conviction to confront the Ungods' servants. The Zephyr Knight Orders were born, eternal adversaries of the Ungods.
	The cirrus, as the first denizens of Tanares to wield magic, taught other species the gods' will and the potency of arcane arts after the initial Ungod invasion. Guided by Zafara, a revered elder, the cirrus significantly contributed to the ascension of the Malrokian Kingdom, endorsing its quest for unity and prosperity. Yet the Ungods' insidious corruption infiltrated the kingdom's heart, heedless of the cirrus' dire warnings. The blind nobility instigated a catastrophic war, inflicting untold suffering upon their people, empowering the Ungods, and ultimately unleashing a cataclysm that fractured the continent and nearly eradicated all civilizations. The cirrus were unjustly vilified for the kingdom's demise, their mastery of arcane magic twisted into a malevolent force responsible for the Malrokian Curse. Persecuted and exiled, the cirrus retreated to distant mountains, vowing to avoid further strife.
	As the mournful shroud of the Fallen and Imperial Ages covered the world, the cirrus withdrew into isolation, refining their knowledge and abilities within their hidden sanctuaries. When the Kemet Invasion threatened to unravel the fabric of their world, they emerged from seclusion, wielding their arcane and divine prowess as a bastion against encroaching darkness. The cirrus fought with valor, striving to avert an other Malrokian Curse that could obliterate their world.
	In the present age, the cirrus serve as enigmatic and formidable guardians, their unwavering devotion to their celestial mission shaping their actions. Amidst a world teetering on the brink of ruin, they symbolize virtue and chivalry, resolute protectors against the relentless threat of the Ungods.
	The seven Zephyr Knight Orders epitomize the cirrus species, their distinct virtues and combat techniques bolstering their collective might. Complex webs of loyalty, rivalry, and collaboration interlace a vibrant tapestry of unity among them. Their enduring faith in the gods, coupled with an ancient mastery of both arcane and divine magic, readied the Cirrus to confront the omnipresent darkness. United in their celestial purpose and unyielding in their commitment, they stand vigilant to safeguard the fragile balance of their world. Shaped by divine will and hardened by adversity, the cirrus bear the undeserved stigma of their people, distrusted by many, even as they valiantly defend the mortal realms from the insidious corruption of the Ungods.</text>

      <name>The First Spellcasters</name>
      <text>Throughout the annals of history, the cirrus have distin guished themselves as the first mortals to pray for the gods, and the earliest scholars to unearth the secrets of wizardry. They seamlessly interlaced magic into the essence of their civilization, forging a society where the might of arcane arts and divine power is entwined with their chivalrous way of life.
	Renowned for their mastery of all forms of magic and their unyielding determination to obliterate the Ungods and their nefarious servants, the cirrus strive to pierce the enigmatic Tanarean Magic Field. They believe that this untamed and raw power holds the key to vanquishing the Ungods once and for all. While many other species consider this a great taboo, for the gods themselves established the Tanaren Magic Field, no condemnation has ever deterred the cirrus from pursuing their belief in this divine mandate to find ultimate magic power.
	The chivalric orders of the cirrus exemplify their ingenious and diverse mastery of magic. Each order embodies a unique fusion of virtues and magical expertise, reflecting the rich complexity of cirrus society. Orders bearing black banners excel in arcane spellcasting, while those with white banners champion divine spells. As per time-honored tradition, every cirrus is expected to join one of these orders upon reaching adulthood, undergoing rigorous training as squires before ascending to the esteemed ranks of knights. Though most embrace the path of spellcasting, not all choose this calling; many cirrus adeptly balance their magical prowess with formidable physical combat skills.
	Magic is woven into the very fabric of cirrus culture, molding their society and their relentless battle against the Ungods. Their insatiable thirst for arcane knowledge and divine wisdom has led them to craft potent rituals, capable of decimating their foes and shielding their people. The cirrus' groundbreaking utilization of magic has bestowed upon them a distinct advantage in their ongoing conflict against the Ungods, and their unyielding determination to unravel the enigma of the Tanarean Magic Field bears witness to their unrelenting pursuit of ultimate triumph.
	As a species that has constructed its very existence upon the foundation of magic, the cirrus exemplifies the limitless potential of arcane and divine power.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Sharing A Body</name>
      <text>The two forms of a cirrus are unique, each considering the other form as another part of their being. For a cirrus, it is so natural to share two forms that they find it strange that individuals of other species are always the same person. 

	• A cirrus always treats their other form as a distinct person, and it is common to hear them say things like "Oh, Torrus did that again?" or "This is something that Arven would love to see."

	• A cirrus is aware of their short time in each form and makes the most of the time before the other form takes over. 

	• Cirrus remember the day lived by the other form as if they had seen the situations in the third person, as mere spectators of the other's life. That's why many of them like to talk to the other form out loud so that the other form can hear them. If they prefer to be discreet, they write a note or something similar. 

	• It is quite common for the two forms to have different functions and responsibilities, understanding that each is, in fact, a different being. Generally, one form of cirrus does not take responsibility for the actions of the other form, as they consider themselves unique beings, and sometimes they disagree with each other's decisions, al though they often agree on some things that require their body to commit daily, such as adventuring in a group or belonging to a team. 

	• The sense of urgency is common among cirrus, as they know that their actions must be limited to a single day. They are generally respectful and have a lot of love for one form to the other, despite the enormous differences, because they understand that they are codependent.</text>

      <name>Two In One</name>
      <text>When creating a cirrus, you must create two distinct character sheets, one representing your Tamerian side and another representing your Bauronean side. Throughout a day, you will use only one of these character sheets, keeping the other stored, and you must switch to the other immediately after the first long rest performed in a 24-hour period (counted from the time the last long rest where you changed your character sheet began). Both character sheets have the same amount of experience, ensuring they will always have the same character level. The benefits granted by a long rest will apply to the character sheet that will assume control after it is performed. Magic items attuned to one side will not be attuned to the other. Some effects will apply to both character sheets, regardless of their origin. They are:

	• Effects with a duration counted in days; 
	• Effects that cause loss of a limb, such as a hand or arm, for example; 
	• Curses or any effects related to the soul; 
	• Levels of exhaustion. If a level of exhaustion is gained or lost by one character sheet, it will be gained or lost equally in the other; and 
	• Death.</text>

      <text>Poisonous scorpid-elves with penumbral roots, these brothers and sisters thrive as defiant survivors valuing hive loyalty and personal liberty. Their unorthodox, resourceful spirit embodies an anarchic, do-it-yourself ethos.

"Hey there, stranger! You've followed the echoes of our drums to our hive, huh? No need for airs and graces here, just our steadfast spirit and unity. We've survived the blackest of night mares and emerged stronger, claiming the freedom to be our authentic selves. Our bold tattoos narrate our lives, and our music thunders in sync with the hive's pulse.
	Join us in the shadows, and you'll see we're pros at navigating these treacherous depths. We stalk the wicked beings that haunted our past, avenging our kin and shielding the world from the Penumbral Plane's horrors. We don't kneel to gods; our rituals are what bind and nourish us, forging unbreak able connections. Earn our trust, and we'll be by your side in battle and beyond, fighting 'til our final breath. But remember, if you stab us in the back, the shadows themselves will turn against you. So, are you prepared to face the darkness with us?"
- Vyxendrak-rar, leader of the Invisible Patrol Hive.

Beneath the vast continent of Tanares lies the shadowy, subterranean realm of the Undertanares, where the resilient and ferocious gloomfolks dwell. Once winter elves, these beings met a dark fate in the eerie Penumbral Plane, a realm tainted by corruption and shadows. Captured and enslaved by the Cult of Shadow Wing, the winter elves were subjected to horrific experiments under Bellara, the Daughter of the Ungods. Seeking to create a new hybrid of mortal creatures and penumbral aberrations for her army, she transformed them into fearsome, scorpion-like creatures.
	The gloomfolk's striking appearance blends elven beauty with scorpid terror. Their upper bodies exhibit the elegant features of their winter elven heritage, while chitinous shells of onyx hues extend from their waists, forming scorpion-like lower halves with vicious pincers and a venomous stinger. Embracing personal expression and rejecting traditional conformity, they don vivid, bold clothes, studded leather jackets, tribal tattoos, iron chains and ragged, comfortable clothing. To them, attire is a means of expressing their individuality, rather than impressing others or signifying status.
	Nestled within the Undertanares' tunnels and caverns, the gloomfolks form tight-knit communities in their hives, celebrating effort, personal talents, independence, and self-sufficiency. Their deep loyalty to their hive binds them together, while their culture challenges societal norms, rarely respecting institutions or authority figures. This stems from their oppressed past, which birthed a deep passion for freedom and a profound distrust of authority and control. Their society eschews propriety; everything belongs to the hive, not individuals, and they reject materialism, embracing alternative lifestyles and artistic expressions that deviate from the norm. Their indomitable spirit is reflected in their love for loud, fast-paced, and aggressive music, featuring powerful drums and shouting vocals.
	Organized into various roles, gloomfolk society includes crafters, hunters, guardians, child-carers, elders, cultivators, mystics, and scouts. Each member plays a vital role in their communal existence, free to change occupations as their desires and knowledge evolve. They prefer creative pursuits and self-reliance over dependence on others. While they welcome other species into their hives, trust must be earned, and treason is the gravest taboo, met with the harshest consequences.
	United in their unique culture, the gloomfolk support and uplift one another, embodying freedom and an indomitable will to survive, even amidst darkness and horror. Their keen reflexes and survival instincts were honed during their enslavement in the Penumbral Plane, under the cruel Cult of Shadow Wing. This experience shaped their unapologetic attitude, strong and independent demeanor, and willingness to confront challenges head-on. Now liberated, their hearts burn with the desire to survive, to thrive, and to take revenge on those who enslaved and twisted them into the fearsome beings they are today.

      <name>Gloomfolk History</name>
      <text>The history of the gloomfolk is a tale of sorrow, transfor mation, and determination. Over three millennia ago, the winter elves sought ways to combat the corruptive influence of the Ungods in Tanares. They studied penumbral energy and ventured into shadowy realms to uncover their enemies' secrets.
	Unfortunately, this journey led many winter elves into the clutches of the sinister Queen Bellara and her arachne minions. These elves were transformed into scorpion-like beings and enslaved by her and the Cult of Shadow Wing for countless centuries.
	In time, the gloomfolks, as they came to be known, formed a society centered around community, survival, and avenging their kin. Their unique culture was shaped by their trans formed bodies and subterranean lifestyles.
	When the sinister Queen Bellara was captured by Malrok, a human hero, the gloomfolk saw a chance for freedom. Under the guidance of a legendary unnamed leader called the Patriarch, they gathered intelligence, crafted weapons, and developed a potent poison to use against their captors. The Patriarch's ingenious traps and strategies led some to speculate that he might have been a deity in disguise, though most gloomfolk dismiss this idea.
	With the Patriarch's help, the gloomfolk staged an uprising, freeing themselves from the cult's grasp and emerging from the Penumbra. They found sanctuary in the subterranean realms of Undertanares, where they formed hives and adapted to their new forms well suited to darkness. Nestled within the labyrinthine tunnels, the gloomfolk nurtured an unwavering loyalty to their hives, erecting them upon the sheer faces of fathomless chasms to deter hostile beings. They forged alliances with the dwarves, and even some goblinoid tribes, while interacting little with the surface dwellers as they were engaged in fierce combat against the Shadow Wing cultists, who unleashed a myriad of monstrous creatures and penumbral rifts throughout Undertanares.
	To further their hunting, the gloomfolks also established hives within the Penumbral Plane itself, using arcane pylons devised by the Draconic Council to create sanctuaries protecting their villages. To this day they continue to explore un charted underground realms and venture into the Penumbral Plane, seeking vengeance against the Ungods searching long-forgotten secrets that can help them in their quest. Their ultimate goal is to end Bellara and avenge their kin.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Hunters of Penumbral Creatures</name>
      <text>Empowered by the cruel experiments imposed upon them by Bellara and the Cult of Shadow Wing, the gloomfolk now wield their formidable abilities to combat their former op pressors. For generations, these vengeful souls have honed their hunting prowess, relentlessly preying on the malevolent forces that once enslaved them.
	During their captivity, the gloomfolk were forced to scrape for food, often resorting to consuming the remains of dead penumbral creatures. This desperate act, combined with the corruptive magic that twisted their bodies, not only allowed them to withstand, but also to gain strength from the flesh of these aberrations. To the gloomfolk, feasting on penumbral creatures is both a delicious meal and a potent symbol of retribution.
	The gloomfolk's distinct ability to feed on these creatures has profoundly influenced their culture and traditions, offering unparalleled sustenance compared to ordinary food sources. This nourishment not only fuels their desire for vengeance but also ensures the growth and fortitude of their offspring. While adult gloomfolk can subsist on conventional fare, their young must ingest the flesh of penumbral beings to achieve their full potential. Their aberrant, scorpion-like forms have an inherent craving for the power harbored within the tainted flesh. Failure to provide the proper nourishment may result in the young growing smaller, weaker, and lacking the resilience to corruption that characterizes the gloomfolk.
	As they need to hunt penumbral creatures to feed their hives, they have mastered the skills of hunting and subterfuge. The gloomfolk stalk their prey through the treacherous tunnels of Undertanares and the sinister layers of the Penumbral Plane with lethal accuracy. Their innate understanding of darkness and ability to navigate challenging terrain grant them an invaluable edge, enabling them to exploit their surroundings to devastating effect.
	Equipped with venomous stingers and robust chitin exoskeletons, the gloomfolk's scorpion-like forms are perfectly adapted for hunting penumbral creatures and aberrations. The toxin they initially developed during their escape plans is still crafted and employed by them, utilizing their innate venom as a crucial ingredient. Impressively, this poison demonstrates efficacy against even the Ungods' spawn that are immune to all other toxins. This ingenious weapon, which played a pivotal role in their emancipation, continues to be vital in their relentless battle against the Ungods and the Cult of Shadow Wing.
	Employing cunning traps, hit-and-run tactics, powerful poisons, and their knowledge of the Penumbral Plane, the gloomfolk have become formidable hunters, continuously weakening the forces of the Ungods. They bring down even the most fearsome foes and serve as valuable allies to all those seeking to eradicate corruption from the world.</text>

      <name>The Hives and the Gloomfolk Society</name>
      <text>At the heart of gloomfolk society thrives the concept of hives, where each individual is cherished for their unique talents and contributions. The absence of hierarchy cultivates an atmosphere of freedom, empowering members to explore and adapt roles in harmony with their desires and expertise. This structure nurtures a potent sense of community, fostering collaboration, mutual support, and shared responsibility among its members.
	Intricate tribal tattoo markings hold immense significance within gloomfolk society. These elaborate patterns symbol ize each individual's hive and skills, allowing gloomfolk to effortlessly recognize one another and swiftly discern their strengths and capabilities. The markings also serve as a canvas for personal expression, reflecting the personality and dis tinct style of each gloomfolk. As individuals embark on their chosen paths, their tattoos evolve to embody their growth, experiences, and triumphs, weaving an evolving and fluid representation of their life's journey.
	Nestled at the core of every hive rests the sacred Hive Stone, a meticulously crafted bauronite stone infused with the blood of all who join the hive, be they newborns or later joiners. This revered object embodies unity, continuity, and shared history among the gloomfolk. As a hive member passes on, their blood is mingled with the stone, entwining their memory and essence into the eternal history of the hive.
	The esteemed elders of the gloomfolk possess a singular connection to the Hive Stone. By merely touching the stone, they can access the memories of all departed hive members, preserving the community's collective wisdom and bestowing it upon future generations. This extraordinary bond between the elders and the Hive Stone instills a deep sense of reverence and duty, with gloomfolk resolute in their willingness to lay down their lives to protect this sacred object.
	Within the embrace of their hives, the gloomfolk forge a profound sense of belonging and interconnectedness. They draw strength from the knowledge and experiences of their ancestors, as well as the unyielding bonds that unite them with their fellow hive members, crafting a resilient and vi brant society. Adventurers seeking to learn the secrets of the Penumbral Plane may find the gloomfolk's knowledge and skills invaluable.</text>

      <name>The Gloomfolk Rituals</name>
      <text>While the gloomfolk lack a formal religion, as their centu ries of suffering caused them to distrust divine protection and worshiping, they have developed many rituals centered on their hives. Most of them are said to be devised by the Patriarch and passed to the first hives; they all celebrate their brotherhood, freedom and their quest to avenge their kin. The four grand rituals are: the Ritual of Initiation, Ritual of Eldermantle, The Return to Shadows, and the Vengeance Day.
	The Ritual of Initiation is performed annually for children reaching adulthood, or to add new members to the hive. The young gloomfolks must complete their first unassisted hunt as a hive without adult intervention. The ritual celebrates the gloomfolk freedom from the Cult of Shadow Wing and their triumph over the penumbral forces.
	The Ritual of Eldermantle is a rite in which a gloomfolk is acknowledged as an elder, their wisdom recognized by the hive. A special marking is added to their tattoos by an other elder, symbolizing wisdom and their most impressive personal feat or trait. Only those who have demonstrated wisdom or great deeds are granted this honor. Those who receive this are able to access the memories of all previous hive members on the Hive Stone.
	The Return to Shadows is a funeral rite observed by the gloomfolk to honor and mourn the passing of one of their kin. In this ceremony, after infusing its blood into the Hive Stone, each member of the hive etches a small portion of the deceased's tattoos onto their own body, thereby preserving the memory and legacy of the departed. If the gloomfolk's death is deemed unjust, the hive pledges to avenge their loss. This rite is carried out even in the absence of a body, as hive members who remember the deceased's tattoo patterns can still engrave the designs onto others. This act of collective remembrance is the most significant aspect of the Return to Shadows ritual.
	The Vengeance Day is a bloody ritual enacted when a hive member betrays the tribe. Each member scars their own body with a pattern representing the offender, symbolizing the enduring wound of their betrayal. A blood hunt is declared against the traitor, and the hive will stop at nothing to bring them to justice. The elders use the Hive Stone and employ ritual magic to help track the traitor, guiding the hive to find and kill the betrayer.</text>

      <text>Reborn with past-life memories and cultural knowledge, the soulborns are expert traders and diplomats, rich in wealth and wisdom from their many lifetimes.

"What's that? Do you sense a familiar aura in the air? I know that feeling all too well. It's a common experience for us soul born, as we are carriers of the memories of all our past lives. Your intuition is right, my friend. You have been here before, although not in this lifetime. It's time for us to delve into the mysteries of your past lives and find the connection that led you here. So let's begin, shall we?"
- Octavius Hadrian Magnus Ulf Leofric Theron Hiroto Aelarion Valtarius Thorid of Hajal

In the realm of Tanares, a rare and remarkable phenomenon gives rise to the soulborn, a people who defy the boundaries of species and culture. These extraordinary beings are born with the soul of a soulborn, reincarnated into the bodies of newborns from various species. Their distinct appearance, marked by gray skin and white, curly hair, sets them apart from their biological kin. These physical alterations stem from the power of their unique souls, a trait not inherited by their offspring, as any child of a soulborn will be born as a normal member of their parents' biological species.
	The genesis of the soulborn traces back to the kemets, a sect of winter elves obsessed with regaining their lost immortality. Their unrelenting pursuit of ancient Kepesh artifacts and rituals led them to a mysterious artifact connected to Ba-Ka, the enigmatic spirit god. In a desperate attempt to seize the artifact, the kemets unleashed a calamitous magical event. The cataclysm annihilated their physical forms but imbued their souls with an unprecedented quality, giving birth to the first soulborn.
	As these newly-formed soulborn reincarnated into different species across Tanares, their souls carried the memories and accomplishments of their past lives. As they mature in their current forms, they regain access to their ancient memories, deepening their connection to their former selves and drawing upon the wisdom of ages.
	Soulborn children display an extraordinary precocity, mastering the art of walking and speaking far earlier than their contemporaries. Though initially obscured, their memories of past lives slowly crystallize as they mature, melding seamlessly with their soul's recollections. This amalgamation of old and new identities fosters a profound comprehension of myriad cultures, enabling them to savor each experience in its entirety.
	These memories initially manifest in dreams, gradually coalescing within the soulborn's consciousness as they re gain fragments of their past over time. Occasionally, intense emotional situations or the presence of certain objects may provoke the retrieval of these lost memory shards. But otherwise, it is a slow and continuous process.
	Throughout countless lives, the soulborn have woven themselves into the tapestry of Tanares' diverse cultures and species. Born into different places, species, and cultures, they develop a unique and multifaceted worldview, learning the values, religions, and languages of many diverse societies. Their unparalleled understanding of diversity makes them invaluable as diplomats, emissaries, and trade representatives. With their accumulated knowledge and resources, they founded influential businesses, guilds, and institutions, and amassed vast lands, starting or elevating many noble houses that still exist to this day.
	Known for their refined and often aristocratic demeanor, they use the most exquisite, elegant, and noble garments, but different than most nobles, they have no prejudice against people of different social statuses as they have experienced life in both the highest and lowest castes.
	Driven by the desire to recover relics from their past lives and forge a better future for their present one and those to come, soulborn adventurers set out on grand journeys. Their intimate familiarity with diverse cultures enables them to form strong alliances with a wide range of allies, often serving as the unifying force in many adventuring parties.

      <name>Soulborn History</name>
      <text>The soulborn's saga is a tale of ambition, transformation, and an unyielding quest for purpose. Rising from the ashes of the Fallen Age after the collapse of the Malrokian Kingdom, the soulborn emerged from a cataclysmic magical event on the enigmatic continent of Darkall. Their origins lie with the kemets, winter elves who pursued a prophecy with fervent zeal.
	In the shadows of the first Malrokian Curse, the kemets waged war against the Kepesh people on the Darkall continent. Fearing another devastating Curse event, the kemets advanced with calculated patience. Amidst the conflict, a faction of kemets, obsessed with reclaiming the elven lost immortality, uncovered an ancient pyramid housing a sacred artifact of the Kepesh spirit god, Ba-Ka.
	The kemet's assault on the site was ill-timed, and chaos ensued as they disrupted a Kepesh ritual at the worst pos sible moment. The unleashed magical forces incinerated all present; Ba-Ka granted his followers' souls passage to his ethereal domain, but not to the kemets. The forsaken kemet souls were imbued with the magic of the artifact's shards, bestowing upon them the unique and unexpected ability to reincarnate, thus giving birth to the soulborn. Although the ritual took place in Darkall, soulborns began to be born anywhere in the world.
	The newly-formed soulborn reincarnated into various species across Tanares, creating a unique comprehension of the world that grew more complex and deep with each incarnation. With the knowledge, prestige, and wealth they amassed, they established influential institutions, including the Bank of Hajal, Tanares' most powerful financial establishment.
	Being born as sons and daughters of other species caused a great initial uproar in Tanares' different societies. Each one reacted in unique ways. The humans of the Capital saw them as souls touched by corruption, not able to become angels in the Tamera and Bauron hosts. For civilizations further away from the Evolutionist Church dogmas they were considered blessed children. The dwarves saw them as blessed at first, but later, after discovering their past, many shunned them as not true dwarves. The taii'maku saw them as a positive force to further the wisdom of their society, treating them normally as one of their own. Thus far, there are no known instances of a soulborn being born among the elven species. Many speculate that this may be due to a curse from Ba-Ka. Besides that, they adapted to their new existences well, and kept searching for a new meaning for their lives.
	During the Kemet Invasion, the soulborns sent all the financial aid they could muster to help combat the invaders, having long since severed their ties to the kemet identity. The first construction of Wharfugee was done with soulborn resources, the city that would be called Heroes Rise after the war. While few of the soulborn joined the battle physically, many were behind the scenes aiding the heroes' efforts. One of the few who joined the fray was Azmodhar, a soulborn historian and scholar who helped the heroes uncover secrets about the kemets' past and their plans.
	After the invasion, with the world fragmented in a cold war, most soulborns chose to maintain neutrality. However, individual soulborns can be found aligned with all different sides of the current conflicts, each pursuing their person al agendas. Motivations range from the pursuit of wealth and power to the protection of their families, businesses, or personal values. Unbeknownst to many, a great number of soulborns continue to support the descendants of their previous lives, making them, as a whole, strongly opposed to war or an escalation of conflict.
	Soulborns, as a collective, are currently focusing their efforts on preventing conflict among Tanares' divided factions. Their neutrality allows them to flourish in the midst of chaos. Although not as fervently dedicated to opposing the Ungods as other species, the soulborn remain mindful of the threat they pose. This is due, in part, to the fact that their own souls cannot be transformed into penumbral creatures upon death.
	Instead, soulborns prioritize the accumulation of wealth and power, as well as securing societal acceptance. Nevertheless, they are more than willing to finance initiatives and operations against the Ungods, fortifying defenses to stave off these sinister beings. By doing so, they indirectly contribute to the greater struggle against the dark forces that plague the land.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Unique Souls Persecuted 
by the Ungods</name>
      <text>Unlike other souls that ascend to celestial heights or descend as penumbral creatures, the soulborn are trapped in an eternal cycle of rebirth. This strange peculiarity both shapes their destinies and fuels debates over whether their fate is a curse or divine providence.
	The reformed Celestianist Church, having cast aside the twisted belief that soulborn were inherently corrupted, now regards them as potential allies against the Ungods. The soul born's inability to be transformed into penumbral abominations is seen as their greatest blessing.
	As their souls continuously reincarnate, the soulborn gain unique perspectives on faith, either unwaveringly devoted to a single religion or exploring myriad of beliefs, ultimately becoming invaluable scholarly assets. Regrettably, their sin gular existence makes them prime targets for the insidious Ungods, who covet immortal cultists capable of infiltrating societies and spreading corruption.
	Soulborn sometimes are abducted and forced into conversion, yet their loyalty falters in subsequent lives. Instead, the Ungods prefer to manipulate the desires and needs of the soulborn, luring them into willful servitude with promises of prosperity in future incarnations.
	This treacherous possibility is known only to scholars and the powerful, but still it breeds distrust toward the soulborn. Unblemished soulborn strive to prove their loyalty by fighting the Cult of Shadow Wing, but their efforts are often in vain, as corrupted soulborn masquerade under the same guise. Nevertheless, they persist, for failure would render them undeniably suspect.
	Aware of the soulborn's immense influence and global connections, the Ungods seek to corrupt or undermine them, knowing that doing so would weaken mortal resistance. Determined to defy this fate, the soulborn use their wealth for the betterment of society, becoming indispensable pillars of commerce, finance, and diplomacy, to prove their worth to their community. But by doing so they place themselves in positions of great importance in the backstages of society. Their disappearance would spell catastrophe, aligning perfectly with the Ungods' nefarious desires.
	Ultimately, the soulborn are more often victims of the Ungods' unyielding persecution than active opponents. Beset by the Ungods, public distrust, and prejudice, they nevertheless persevere, emerging as influential puppeteers in Tanares. Their penchant for operating in the shadows is born of their precarious existence, masterfully managing resources from the background with unparalleled efficacy.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Family and Business</name>
      <text>Soulborns traverse multiple lives, amassing an array of experiences that span diverse cultures and species. This unique heritage renders them exceptional ambassadors and representatives for commerce, their connections and insights facilitating the establishment of guilds, shops, and enterprises. Their preference for long-term investments reflects their foresight, ensuring returns in future lives.
	Soulborns form unique family dynamics due to their eternal nature. Their children, born from the species of their current biological parents, lack the immortality of their soulborn parent. Consequently, soulborns cherish their offspring, aware of their vulnerability and single lifespan. These eternal beings are fiercely devoted to their families, willing to take immense risks to protect and give a good life to them, conscious that their loved ones have just one life to live.
	As soulborns accumulate new relationships and wealth across lives, they display varying attitudes toward their assets. Good-aligned soulborns prioritize family security, leaving substantial inheritance for their loved ones and relying on their ability to rebuild wealth in future lives. Some egoistic or evil-aligned soulborns may hoard their resources, ensuring opulence in their next incarnation while leaving their families with lesser parts of their wealth after their deaths.
	Soulborns often maintain a low profile, interacting with high-ranking individuals and attending high-class festivities discreetly. They take pleasure in the finest food, drink, and accommodations, having developed refined tastes across their many lives. However, they remain adaptable, as many have experienced hardships in past lives.
	Soulborns might favor descendants from previous lives, finding joy in observing their grandchildren or grand-grand children. However, their primary focus generally remains on their current family. Descendants from prior lives sometimes seek out their soulborn ancestors to uncover family history or plead for wealth, but the later pursuits can be met with resistance, as soulborns often find this disrespectful.
	As patrons of adventuring companies and mercenary groups, soulborns wield considerable influence in Tanares' political conflicts. Adventurers may become entangled in a web of intrigue, navigating the interests of their soulborn benefactors alongside their own goals. As adventurers them selves, they are less afraid of death, as they know they will be reborn, yet they are not inconsequential. They also form cohesive bonds with various allies, their unique perspective binding diverse groups together on their quests for ancient objects of their past and a better future for their next lives.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Ancient Relics of Past Lives</name>
      <text>Compelled to preserve and reconnect with their former lives, soulborns often invest in museums, antiquaries, and expeditions to uncover relics that serve as both invaluable anchors and conduits of wisdom between their existences.
	Though not always art connoisseurs, soulborns are driven to assemble collections that honor their past lives, with a particular fondness for portraits of themselves and their families. In each incarnation, they commission the most skilled artists to craft these cherished heirlooms, ensuring their legacy endures through the ages.
	The soulborns' affinity for relics transcends mere personal interest; they often become esteemed scholars, historians, and curators of prestigious museums. By financing archaeological expeditions and engaging adventurers or mercenaries to delve into perilous ruins, they unearth long-lost treasures and cultural artifacts from the very epochs they once inhabited.
	Embracing their role as custodians of history, many soulborns join the ranks of the Relic Hunters Guild, banding together in their quest to reclaim the remnants of the past. As they traverse ancient landscapes, they relish the opportunity to witness the echoes of their past firsthand, even venturing into danger to see again the scenarios they saw in their previous lives, often using the support of hired guards or esteemed companions.
	Soulborns stand as eternal witnesses to the ever-shifting world of Tanares, weaving together the threads of time as they preserve and honor the vestiges of their many lives.</text>

      <text>Standing tall and robust, the taii'maku are pacifist intellectuals who favor logic over emotions. They excel in math and engineering, creating remarkable inventions.

"Cough... cough... excuse me. I'll put my pipe aside. Well, as I was saying, think of the world as a big structure full of intertwined gears, activated by the correct operation of levers. Therefore, if a part is defective, or if the synchronization is out of rhythm, the entire structure can be affected, generating a chain collapse. In this way, we must be quick and precise to detect which parts need maintenance or replacement, so that the movement is adequately preserved. I hope you don't mind the extra detail, I tend to get carried away with my explanations."
- U'Tibam, the most brilliant mind of Tanar

The taii'maku, a majestic and enigmatic species, exude an aura of reverence and admiration that leaves a lasting impression upon those who cross their path. Towering figures with sinewy builds and earth-toned complexions, their most captivating feature lies within their fascinating, luminous white eyes, which seem to radiate boundless intelligence and curiosity. A signature trait of the taii'maku is their near-absence of emotion, cultivated through meditation and adherence to a philosophy steeped in logic, enabling them to maintain a serene, respectful, and stoic demeanor, even in the most dire of circumstances.
	Possessing a keen, logic-driven intellect, the taii'maku prioritize rationality in their daily lives, exhibiting remarkable prowess in engineering and mathematics. They frequently categorize decisions as either "logical" or "illogical" when evaluating situations and determining their course of action. Even their spellcasters perceive magic as sophisticated formulas and complex equations, employing this knowledge to forge exceptional mechanical golems and constructs. The taii'maku's legendary mobile cities, known as Illus, are powered by the arcane energies harnessed from bauronite ores, epitomizing their unparalleled mastery in harmonizing magic and technology to birth utopian wonders.
	As a nomadic society, the taii'maku are in perpetual motion, ceaselessly seeking new resources and knowledge, while refining theories in mathematics, physics, magic, and the fabric of the cosmos. They hold libraries and educational institutions in the highest esteem, embodying their devotion to the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge.
	This mindset, however, can render the taii'maku ill equipped to comprehend or participate in humor. Some may take jests literally or fail to recognize them as such, while others may attempt humor without the inherent flair for it, resulting in contrived or ill-timed jokes that provoke laughter at their own expense, rather than shared mirth.
	Their polite and pacifist way make them easy to coexist with other species, but their lack of emotions and rational minds may inadvertently offend or alarm others. Elves and dwarves, particularly those who have lived longer, tend to share a more detached perspective on life, resonating with the taii'maku, while halflings, humans, and gloomfolk may perceive the taii'maku as arrogant or even immoral when they present unemotional and logical courses of action.
	The taii'maku approach the world through a practical and unvarnished lens, perceiving everything, including society itself, as a machine where each component must function harmoniously. They often endeavor to "fix" individuals through education, much like mending machines, structures, or other malfunctioning systems. While their precision and efficiency are indeed commendable, their stoic demeanor, emotional detachment, and impassive expressions can occasionally lead to miscommunication with other species.

      <name>Taii'maku History</name>
      <text>Born during the Godly Age, the brilliant taii'maku species emerged from the wills of Tamera and Bauron as a species created to bring progress and harmony, so they could extend this benevolence to all living beings.
	As a nomadic people, the taii'maku cleverly avoided conflict by employing their extraordinary engineering prowess and bauronite extraction methods to construct the Illus, their magnificent mobile cities. This enabled them to relocate continuously, evading disputes with neighboring species.
	When the Ungods first attacked, the taii'maku focused on protecting their people and providing refuge to others. They employed sophisticated magical constructs to fend off the relentless onslaught. However, the Ungods released the kikokus, sinister insectoid creatures capable of corrupting and controlling the taii'maku's constructs. Although the taii'maku eventually repelled the kikokus, the victory came at the cost of thousands of their lives.
	In the wake of this conflict, the taii'maku formed an alliance with humans, establishing the Malrokian Kingdom under King Malrok's vision of peaceful unity. They innovated the concept of nonviolent dispute resolution through athletic competition in specially designed arenas. Regrettably, this noble idea was later corrupted by the Tanarean Empire.
	The Cult of Shadow Wing infiltrated the Malrokian nobility, forcing the taii'maku to confront the tainted aristocracy. The nobles' greed and refusal to heed taii'maku advice culminated in the Malrokian Curse—a disaster that nearly destroyed the world. Disillusioned, the taii'maku withdrew to their Illus, seeking solace in knowledge and solitude.
	During the Imperial Age, Emperor Baleroth attempted to gain access to the taii'maku's magical and engineering expertise but was met with resistance. This covert persecution only exacerbated their isolationist tendencies and mistrust of other species.
	The Kemet Invasion marked a turning point. The Illus endured relentless assaults, and Tanares heroes and taii'maku champions provided crucial support. This siege exposed the dangers of isolation, prompting taii'maku heroes to persuade their people to reconnect and exchange knowledge with other species. Gradually, the Illus reintegrated into a broader network of commerce and intellectual collaboration.
	Today, the taii'maku navigate the intricate politics of the realms, striving to protect their secrets and uphold their values. Some Illus remain independent, while others form alliances or openly support factions. Many have joined the Allied Forces, exploring new strategies to fight the Ungods.
	Although they yearn for cooperative endeavors, the taii'maku encounter challenges from unpredictable behavior and conflicting agendas among various factions. Their councils maintain vigilance against espionage and deceit, working to safeguard taii'maku secrets. Despite these hurdles, they persist in strengthening their repositories of knowledge.
	In recent times, the taii'maku have assisted in developing infrastructure across numerous human cities, particularly within the Republic and the Tanarean Empire. Their excep tional construction and engineering expertise have vastly improved the quality of life in these regions. They have al so established a nuanced relationship with the Magocracy of Mage Tower, engaging in lively debates and exchanging wisdom with their mages. However, the taii'maku remain wary, expressing concerns about the ethical implications of certain experiments conducted by the Magocracy.</text>

      <name>Contributing to a Better World</name>
      <text>The taii'maku stand in Tanares as architects of progress, tirelessly striving to forge a harmonious existence for all inhabitants. Their commitment to innovation and progress has given rise to astonishing constructs that seamlessly perform tasks, ensuring transportation, security, and unwavering support in their quest for an idyllic society.
	Masters of their craft, the taii'maku have achieved seemingly impossible feats: quenching the parched desert with life-giving water, taming the fury of unyielding floods, and constructing sophisticated sanitation systems. Their ingenious roadways bridge the gaps between cities and kingdoms, fostering unity and cooperation in the face of adversity.
	Taii'maku cities serve as radiant beacons of their grand vision, with constructs assuming the mantle of manual labor, allowing the citizens to immerse themselves in contemplation, research, and personal growth. Massive mechanical wagons and swift-flying vessels transport people with ease, while constructs dutifully cater to every conceivable task.
	In their pursuit of a brighter future, the taii'maku remain ever vigilant against the persistent menace of the kikoku. With unwavering resolve, they thwart these sinister creatures' attempts to reproduce and breach their resplendent cities.
	The taii'maku wield wisdom and reason as formidable weapons, serving as advisors and guides in a world beset by strife and corruption. Their most gifted strategists and thinkers labor tirelessly to craft intricate plans and tactics to counter the insidious influence of the Ungods, extending aid and warnings to other realms, even when their words fall on deaf ears.
	Through their steadfast dedication to logic and unyielding resistance to the vices and temptations of the Ungods, the taii'maku emerge as a formidable adversary in the battle against malevolent forces. Their very existence presents a challenge that the Ungods are all too eager to eliminate, yet the taii'maku remain undeterred, resolute in their mission to unite and uplift the denizens of Tanares.</text>

      <name>Taii'maku Society</name>
      <text>In the heart of the taii'maku civilization, a steadfast dedication to logic, rationality, and the pursuit of knowledge beats like a resonant drum. Eschewing traditional faith in deities, they perceive gods as highly evolved entities, masters of profound wisdom and comprehension of reality. Within their ranks, clerics and paladins exist, but they view them selves as emissaries of superior wisdom rather than servants of a divine being.
	The essence of taii'maku culture lies in order and balance, reflected by their harmonious, symmetrical, and geometric city architecture. Crafted with meticulous accuracy, their urban landscapes optimize mystical energy efficiency and resource management. Their cuisine, mirroring their methodical nature, emphasizes objectivity and efficiency over taste and presentation, crafting meals that deliver optimal health and nutrient intake.
	In their relationships, the taii'maku exhibit an extraordinary form of empathy. Devoid of emotional experience, it stems from understanding the logical and practical needs of others. Their ethical framework originates from a deep thought experiment in which they shed all knowledge of
	identity, status, and personal circumstances to impartially inhabit the lives of every individual. This process allows them to grasp the needs and perspectives of all beings, forging an ethical rule that is equitable and just for all. Such an approach is vital for the taii'maku to create a society that caters to everyone's needs without succumbing to oppression or tyranny.
	In pursuit of this ideal, they strive for a harmonious societal balance, ensuring the well-being of all without sacrificing the few. Every voice is heard and respected, fostering unity and shared understanding.
	Marriage in taii'maku society is deemed a logical obligation and lifelong commitment. Couples are selected based on intellectual compatibility and the potential to counter balance each other's weaknesses, resulting in partners with vastly different skill sets. When raising children, taii'maku parents display a profound sense of responsibility, attentive ness, and devotion, particularly in education and imparting wisdom. However, their parenting approach lacks the emotional warmth observed in other species.
	Society is structured around a knowledge-based hierarchy, with an individual's status determined by their contributions to collective wisdom. Their economy revolves around trading knowledge and bauronite ore, prioritizing the exchange of information, discoveries, ideas, and components for crafts and research over traditional gold coins. This system nurtures a culture of perpetual learning and innovation.
	Taii'maku governance is anchored in public councils led by the eldest members, inviting anyone with a contribution to engage in discussions. Decisions are made through vot ing, emphasizing logic over personal biases and frequently resulting in unanimous or near-unanimous outcomes, as they discuss until every individual is satisfied.
	The deep Taii'maku language, comprised of intricate symbols and exact mathematical forms, enables efficient and meticulous idea exchanges, unparalleled in Tanares. In leisure, they partake in intellectual debates, exchanging logical arguments to persuade their audience, or team sports that demand exceptional coordination and tactics.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Math, Engineering, and Constructs</name>
      <text>Within the great halls of the taii'maku civilization, an un paralleled mastery of mathematics, engineering, and magic reverberates through every aspect of their intricate culture. This extraordinary fusion breathes life into a myriad of con structs, each pulsating with the volatile yet potent mystical energies of bauronite.
	Highly advanced constructs serve as the lifeblood of taii'maku society, ceaselessly fulfilling a diverse array of roles. From performing menial tasks and physical labor to acting as speedy vehicles, these constructs enable the taii'maku to dedicate their time to intellectual pursuits. Sentinel constructs vigilantly patrol the cities, responding to taii'maku commands and maintaining unwavering security. Transportation constructs range from horse-sized golems and massive mechanical wagons to soaring aerial machines and even city-sized, mobile Illus. The zenith of taii'maku engineering culminates in the impressive Giant Defenders, colossal constructs that rival the tallest giants and safeguard the Illus from ever-present threats.
	Yet, all taii'maku constructs necessitate fastidious maintenance to stave off corruption from their bauronite cores, which, if left unchecked, could render them uncontrollable and perilous.
	The taii'maku's resolute devotion to order, balance, and precision, coupled with their reverence for knowledge, forms the bedrock of their unique capabilities. They alone possess the aptitude to craft such remarkable constructs. Their culture fosters an environment that encourages ceaseless learning and innovation, transforming these constructs into more than just feats of engineering; they stand as emblematic representations of the taii'maku's relentless pursuit of progress.
	U'Tibam, the most eminent taii'maku mind of his era, epitomizes their exceptional intellect. His groundbreaking contributions to mathematics and the creation of the mightiest giant construct ever forged, a pivotal weapon against the Kemet Invasion, further highlight the taii'maku's ingenuity.
	The Illus frequently find themselves in need of specific resources to further their research or repair their constructs, often enlisting the aid of intrepid adventurers to procure the rare materials they require. Taii'Maku cities also tirelessly search for spies and purloined information or artifacts, offering bountiful rewards for their safe recovery. Prioritizing security above all else, the taii'maku remain perpetually vigilant for signs of infiltration, as the secrets of their constructs' creation and operation must be fiercely safeguarded.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Mathematical Approach to Magic</name>
      <text>In the arcane domain, the taii'maku stand as a testament to their revolutionary theories that intricately weave the tapestry of magic with the threads of mathematics. This matchless approach births the crafting of impeccably precise magic circles and potent enchanted artifacts, transcending the symbolic renderings typically employed by their wizardly counterparts.
	The taii'maku spellcasters envision the cosmos as bound by a set of logical principles that can be deciphered through mathematical expressions, deeming magic as an extension of the physical realm. This unique perspective enables them to interlace mathematics within their incantations, and as such, taii'maku wizards etch their spells as algebraic formulas in their grimoires, deeming conventional symbols to be cumbersome and inefficient.
	As bold adventurers embark on perilous journeys into the depths of time-forgotten ruins, they may chance upon ancient tomes inscribed by legendary taii'maku archmages or unearth enigmatic arcane mechanisms, both teeming with labyrinthine equations that call for the keen intellect of the most erudite taii'maku minds to decipher. As they navigate through the forsaken remnants of bygone Illus, they may unveil cryptic geometric patterns that cloak concealed chambers. Nestled within these shrouded sanctuaries, one may find elaborate taii'maku-crafted magic circles, poised to unleash formidable and mysterious forces.
	The taii'maku's unwavering belief in a world that is inherently logical and mathematically harmonious drives their relentless pursuit of transcending the limitations of the arcane. Through their groundbreaking amalgamation of mathematics and mysticism, they forge breathtaking spells, enchanted relics, and wondrous contraptions imbued with unparalleled potency. It is their fervent aspiration to harness these mystical creations to reshape the world for the better.</text>

      <name>Taii'maku Names</name>
      <text>Taii'makian words usually consist of short syllables with hard consonants that are pronounced with one's jaws closed, creating a distinct sound that other species hardly ever re produce correctly.

      <text>Standing tall and robust, the taii'maku are pacifist intellectuals who favor logic over emotions. They excel in math and engineering, creating remarkable inventions.

"Cough... cough... excuse me. I'll put my pipe aside. Well, as I was saying, think of the world as a big structure full of intertwined gears, activated by the correct operation of levers. Therefore, if a part is defective, or if the synchronization is out of rhythm, the entire structure can be affected, generating a chain collapse. In this way, we must be quick and precise to detect which parts need maintenance or replacement, so that the movement is adequately preserved. I hope you don't mind the extra detail, I tend to get carried away with my explanations."
- U'Tibam, the most brilliant mind of Tanar

The taii'maku, a majestic and enigmatic species, exude an aura of reverence and admiration that leaves a lasting impression upon those who cross their path. Towering figures with sinewy builds and earth-toned complexions, their most captivating feature lies within their fascinating, luminous white eyes, which seem to radiate boundless intelligence and curiosity. A signature trait of the taii'maku is their near-absence of emotion, cultivated through meditation and adherence to a philosophy steeped in logic, enabling them to maintain a serene, respectful, and stoic demeanor, even in the most dire of circumstances.
	Possessing a keen, logic-driven intellect, the taii'maku prioritize rationality in their daily lives, exhibiting remarkable prowess in engineering and mathematics. They frequently categorize decisions as either "logical" or "illogical" when evaluating situations and determining their course of action. Even their spellcasters perceive magic as sophisticated formulas and complex equations, employing this knowledge to forge exceptional mechanical golems and constructs. The taii'maku's legendary mobile cities, known as Illus, are powered by the arcane energies harnessed from bauronite ores, epitomizing their unparalleled mastery in harmonizing magic and technology to birth utopian wonders.
	As a nomadic society, the taii'maku are in perpetual motion, ceaselessly seeking new resources and knowledge, while refining theories in mathematics, physics, magic, and the fabric of the cosmos. They hold libraries and educational institutions in the highest esteem, embodying their devotion to the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge.
	This mindset, however, can render the taii'maku ill equipped to comprehend or participate in humor. Some may take jests literally or fail to recognize them as such, while others may attempt humor without the inherent flair for it, resulting in contrived or ill-timed jokes that provoke laughter at their own expense, rather than shared mirth.
	Their polite and pacifist way make them easy to coexist with other species, but their lack of emotions and rational minds may inadvertently offend or alarm others. Elves and dwarves, particularly those who have lived longer, tend to share a more detached perspective on life, resonating with the taii'maku, while halflings, humans, and gloomfolk may perceive the taii'maku as arrogant or even immoral when they present unemotional and logical courses of action.
	The taii'maku approach the world through a practical and unvarnished lens, perceiving everything, including society itself, as a machine where each component must function harmoniously. They often endeavor to "fix" individuals through education, much like mending machines, structures, or other malfunctioning systems. While their precision and efficiency are indeed commendable, their stoic demeanor, emotional detachment, and impassive expressions can occasionally lead to miscommunication with other species.

      <name>Taii'maku History</name>
      <text>Born during the Godly Age, the brilliant taii'maku species emerged from the wills of Tamera and Bauron as a species created to bring progress and harmony, so they could extend this benevolence to all living beings.
	As a nomadic people, the taii'maku cleverly avoided conflict by employing their extraordinary engineering prowess and bauronite extraction methods to construct the Illus, their magnificent mobile cities. This enabled them to relocate continuously, evading disputes with neighboring species.
	When the Ungods first attacked, the taii'maku focused on protecting their people and providing refuge to others. They employed sophisticated magical constructs to fend off the relentless onslaught. However, the Ungods released the kikokus, sinister insectoid creatures capable of corrupting and controlling the taii'maku's constructs. Although the taii'maku eventually repelled the kikokus, the victory came at the cost of thousands of their lives.
	In the wake of this conflict, the taii'maku formed an alliance with humans, establishing the Malrokian Kingdom under King Malrok's vision of peaceful unity. They innovated the concept of nonviolent dispute resolution through athletic competition in specially designed arenas. Regrettably, this noble idea was later corrupted by the Tanarean Empire.
	The Cult of Shadow Wing infiltrated the Malrokian nobility, forcing the taii'maku to confront the tainted aristocracy. The nobles' greed and refusal to heed taii'maku advice culminated in the Malrokian Curse—a disaster that nearly destroyed the world. Disillusioned, the taii'maku withdrew to their Illus, seeking solace in knowledge and solitude.
	During the Imperial Age, Emperor Baleroth attempted to gain access to the taii'maku's magical and engineering expertise but was met with resistance. This covert persecution only exacerbated their isolationist tendencies and mistrust of other species.
	The Kemet Invasion marked a turning point. The Illus endured relentless assaults, and Tanares heroes and taii'maku champions provided crucial support. This siege exposed the dangers of isolation, prompting taii'maku heroes to persuade their people to reconnect and exchange knowledge with other species. Gradually, the Illus reintegrated into a broader network of commerce and intellectual collaboration.
	Today, the taii'maku navigate the intricate politics of the realms, striving to protect their secrets and uphold their values. Some Illus remain independent, while others form alliances or openly support factions. Many have joined the Allied Forces, exploring new strategies to fight the Ungods.
	Although they yearn for cooperative endeavors, the taii'maku encounter challenges from unpredictable behavior and conflicting agendas among various factions. Their councils maintain vigilance against espionage and deceit, working to safeguard taii'maku secrets. Despite these hurdles, they persist in strengthening their repositories of knowledge.
	In recent times, the taii'maku have assisted in developing infrastructure across numerous human cities, particularly within the Republic and the Tanarean Empire. Their excep tional construction and engineering expertise have vastly improved the quality of life in these regions. They have al so established a nuanced relationship with the Magocracy of Mage Tower, engaging in lively debates and exchanging wisdom with their mages. However, the taii'maku remain wary, expressing concerns about the ethical implications of certain experiments conducted by the Magocracy.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Contributing to a Better World</name>
      <text>The taii'maku stand in Tanares as architects of progress, tirelessly striving to forge a harmonious existence for all inhabitants. Their commitment to innovation and progress has given rise to astonishing constructs that seamlessly perform tasks, ensuring transportation, security, and unwavering support in their quest for an idyllic society.
	Masters of their craft, the taii'maku have achieved seemingly impossible feats: quenching the parched desert with life-giving water, taming the fury of unyielding floods, and constructing sophisticated sanitation systems. Their ingenious roadways bridge the gaps between cities and kingdoms, fostering unity and cooperation in the face of adversity.
	Taii'maku cities serve as radiant beacons of their grand vision, with constructs assuming the mantle of manual labor, allowing the citizens to immerse themselves in contemplation, research, and personal growth. Massive mechanical wagons and swift-flying vessels transport people with ease, while constructs dutifully cater to every conceivable task.
	In their pursuit of a brighter future, the taii'maku remain ever vigilant against the persistent menace of the kikoku. With unwavering resolve, they thwart these sinister creatures' attempts to reproduce and breach their resplendent cities.
	The taii'maku wield wisdom and reason as formidable weapons, serving as advisors and guides in a world beset by strife and corruption. Their most gifted strategists and thinkers labor tirelessly to craft intricate plans and tactics to counter the insidious influence of the Ungods, extending aid and warnings to other realms, even when their words fall on deaf ears.
	Through their steadfast dedication to logic and unyielding resistance to the vices and temptations of the Ungods, the taii'maku emerge as a formidable adversary in the battle against malevolent forces. Their very existence presents a challenge that the Ungods are all too eager to eliminate, yet the taii'maku remain undeterred, resolute in their mission to unite and uplift the denizens of Tanares.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Taii'maku Society</name>
      <text>In the heart of the taii'maku civilization, a steadfast dedication to logic, rationality, and the pursuit of knowledge beats like a resonant drum. Eschewing traditional faith in deities, they perceive gods as highly evolved entities, masters of profound wisdom and comprehension of reality. Within their ranks, clerics and paladins exist, but they view them selves as emissaries of superior wisdom rather than servants of a divine being.
	The essence of taii'maku culture lies in order and balance, reflected by their harmonious, symmetrical, and geometric city architecture. Crafted with meticulous accuracy, their urban landscapes optimize mystical energy efficiency and resource management. Their cuisine, mirroring their methodical nature, emphasizes objectivity and efficiency over taste and presentation, crafting meals that deliver optimal health and nutrient intake.
	In their relationships, the taii'maku exhibit an extraordinary form of empathy. Devoid of emotional experience, it stems from understanding the logical and practical needs of others. Their ethical framework originates from a deep thought experiment in which they shed all knowledge of
	identity, status, and personal circumstances to impartially inhabit the lives of every individual. This process allows them to grasp the needs and perspectives of all beings, forging an ethical rule that is equitable and just for all. Such an approach is vital for the taii'maku to create a society that caters to everyone's needs without succumbing to oppression or tyranny.
	In pursuit of this ideal, they strive for a harmonious societal balance, ensuring the well-being of all without sacrificing the few. Every voice is heard and respected, fostering unity and shared understanding.
	Marriage in taii'maku society is deemed a logical obligation and lifelong commitment. Couples are selected based on intellectual compatibility and the potential to counter balance each other's weaknesses, resulting in partners with vastly different skill sets. When raising children, taii'maku parents display a profound sense of responsibility, attentive ness, and devotion, particularly in education and imparting wisdom. However, their parenting approach lacks the emotional warmth observed in other species.
	Society is structured around a knowledge-based hierarchy, with an individual's status determined by their contributions to collective wisdom. Their economy revolves around trading knowledge and bauronite ore, prioritizing the exchange of information, discoveries, ideas, and components for crafts and research over traditional gold coins. This system nurtures a culture of perpetual learning and innovation.
	Taii'maku governance is anchored in public councils led by the eldest members, inviting anyone with a contribution to engage in discussions. Decisions are made through vot ing, emphasizing logic over personal biases and frequently resulting in unanimous or near-unanimous outcomes, as they discuss until every individual is satisfied.
	The deep Taii'maku language, comprised of intricate symbols and exact mathematical forms, enables efficient and meticulous idea exchanges, unparalleled in Tanares. In leisure, they partake in intellectual debates, exchanging logical arguments to persuade their audience, or team sports that demand exceptional coordination and tactics.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Math, Engineering, and Constructs</name>
      <text>Within the great halls of the taii'maku civilization, an un paralleled mastery of mathematics, engineering, and magic reverberates through every aspect of their intricate culture. This extraordinary fusion breathes life into a myriad of con structs, each pulsating with the volatile yet potent mystical energies of bauronite.
	Highly advanced constructs serve as the lifeblood of taii'maku society, ceaselessly fulfilling a diverse array of roles. From performing menial tasks and physical labor to acting as speedy vehicles, these constructs enable the taii'maku to dedicate their time to intellectual pursuits. Sentinel constructs vigilantly patrol the cities, responding to taii'maku commands and maintaining unwavering security. Transportation constructs range from horse-sized golems and massive mechanical wagons to soaring aerial machines and even city-sized, mobile Illus. The zenith of taii'maku engineering culminates in the impressive Giant Defenders, colossal constructs that rival the tallest giants and safeguard the Illus from ever-present threats.
	Yet, all taii'maku constructs necessitate fastidious maintenance to stave off corruption from their bauronite cores, which, if left unchecked, could render them uncontrollable and perilous.
	The taii'maku's resolute devotion to order, balance, and precision, coupled with their reverence for knowledge, forms the bedrock of their unique capabilities. They alone possess the aptitude to craft such remarkable constructs. Their culture fosters an environment that encourages ceaseless learning and innovation, transforming these constructs into more than just feats of engineering; they stand as emblematic representations of the taii'maku's relentless pursuit of progress.
	U'Tibam, the most eminent taii'maku mind of his era, epitomizes their exceptional intellect. His groundbreaking contributions to mathematics and the creation of the mightiest giant construct ever forged, a pivotal weapon against the Kemet Invasion, further highlight the taii'maku's ingenuity.
	The Illus frequently find themselves in need of specific resources to further their research or repair their constructs, often enlisting the aid of intrepid adventurers to procure the rare materials they require. Taii'Maku cities also tirelessly search for spies and purloined information or artifacts, offering bountiful rewards for their safe recovery. Prioritizing security above all else, the taii'maku remain perpetually vigilant for signs of infiltration, as the secrets of their constructs' creation and operation must be fiercely safeguarded.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Mathematical Approach to Magic</name>
      <text>In the arcane domain, the taii'maku stand as a testament to their revolutionary theories that intricately weave the tapestry of magic with the threads of mathematics. This matchless approach births the crafting of impeccably precise magic circles and potent enchanted artifacts, transcending the symbolic renderings typically employed by their wizardly counterparts.
	The taii'maku spellcasters envision the cosmos as bound by a set of logical principles that can be deciphered through mathematical expressions, deeming magic as an extension of the physical realm. This unique perspective enables them to interlace mathematics within their incantations, and as such, taii'maku wizards etch their spells as algebraic formulas in their grimoires, deeming conventional symbols to be cumbersome and inefficient.
	As bold adventurers embark on perilous journeys into the depths of time-forgotten ruins, they may chance upon ancient tomes inscribed by legendary taii'maku archmages or unearth enigmatic arcane mechanisms, both teeming with labyrinthine equations that call for the keen intellect of the most erudite taii'maku minds to decipher. As they navigate through the forsaken remnants of bygone Illus, they may unveil cryptic geometric patterns that cloak concealed chambers. Nestled within these shrouded sanctuaries, one may find elaborate taii'maku-crafted magic circles, poised to unleash formidable and mysterious forces.
	The taii'maku's unwavering belief in a world that is inherently logical and mathematically harmonious drives their relentless pursuit of transcending the limitations of the arcane. Through their groundbreaking amalgamation of mathematics and mysticism, they forge breathtaking spells, enchanted relics, and wondrous contraptions imbued with unparalleled potency. It is their fervent aspiration to harness these mystical creations to reshape the world for the better.</text>

Ever a joy to children, geppettin resemble living playthings made of wood, cloth, or porcelain. Though easily mistaken for puppets, geppettin aren't manipulated by a just-out-of-sight puppeteer; they are animated, sentient, and independent.

Bisque geppettin are a form of porcelain doll, crafted with exacting specification and luxurious clothing materials. Though they are designed to look as realistic as possible, they are certainly the most terrifying of geppettin due to their lifeless visage. Though their faces are often very fragile, their construction is generally much hardier than their brethren's.

—Carlo Collodi, Le Avventure di Pinocchio

Ever a joy to children, geppettin resemble living playthings made of wood, cloth, or porcelain. Though easily mistaken for puppets, geppettin aren't manipulated by a just-out-of-sight puppeteer; they are animated, sentient, and independent.

Marionette geppettin are made mostly out of wood, with painted faces and carved clothing. Due to their construction, their jointed limbs are quite flexible, and they are known to be fantastic dancers. The very largest marionettes, called mannequins, stand as tall as a human and bear completely blank, expressionless faces.

      <text>"It was an ancient thing of moss-covered wood which creaked like a greatoak as it breathed, but I'll never forget its eyes: those glowing points were a thing of the fey, a thing of the deep woods forgotten to man."
—Faizon the Blue, encountering a mandrake

Laymen believe that mandrakes are wailing babies grown from the roots of a plant. However, such mandrakes are those which are harvested too early; literally children still in infancy. If allowed to grow for a year and a day before being harvested, mandrakes can mature into great and powerful tree people.

      <name>Flesh from Wood</name>
      <text>With a skin of thick bark and leaves growing at their extremities, you could be forgiven for believing that mandrakes are simply bizarre plants, treants, or animated trees. This might even be partially true: it seems that while mandrakes originated from some plant ancestor, they have become something midway between animal and plant through strange magic or stranger evolution.
	Mandrake anatomies are filled with paradoxes. They bleed a ruby ichor, reminiscent of both blood and sap. Their hearts, which look like a knot of roots, pump this around their body, enriching it with oxygen borne by leaves and special pores on their extremities. By preference, mandrakes can bask in the sunlight or consume living things for nourishment, and can even absorb nutrients through their feet, though they rarely subsist by sunlight and water alone.</text>

      <name>Forest Envoys</name>
      <text>Alchemists and arcanists alike scratch their heads at mandrakes, but druids know them as the green emissaries who stand between the realms of animals and plants, making peace for all parties. To druidic tradition, mandrakes are unique, ancient constructions of Mother Nature herself, intended to act as delegates for her will. Mandrakes are credited by old druids for aligning elves with the forests and dwarves with the mountains; only with the rising tide of humanoids and their preponderance of gods did most creatures forget about Mother Nature and her half-plant ambassadors.
	Today, mandrakes are rare, and make their homes in the forests near where villages and cities meet the true wilds. Humans tell tales of mandrakes savaging those who enter their domain, but druids and those who respect the old traditions of the forest know that such ire is seldom undeserved.</text>

It happens that few mousefolk aspire to heroism, but a certain moral compass often compels mousefolk to a higher cause.
	As a rule, mousefolk are good to their neighbors and rarely pick fights; after all, most people can be reasoned with. Those who can't be reasoned with, however, should rightly fear mousefolk striking at their knees. Mousefolk don't suffer bullies lightly.
	Despite their valorous legacies, no histories are written about the mousefolk culture itself. This i s because the mousefolk language, Rodentia, has no written form, and mousefolk preserve thier history in stories and songs passed from elders to children throughout the generations.</text>

      <text>The Ethereal Plane is rightly believed to be the domain of restless, transient souls. However, the Border Ethereal, which lies closer to the Material Plane, has its fair share of adopted inhabitants, such as the blink dog and phase spider. Spirithosts are the only humanoids to have adpoted this plane, and might be considered its only true descendents.
	Though their bodies resemble that of ghostsslightly translucent and glowing with a pale, white light-spirithosts are not undead. Far from it: they are born, grow old, die, and can even raise children. Yet the stigma of undeath lingers over them. Many a well-meaning but ignorant cleric or paladin has tried to turn or banish a spirithost to no avail. To avoid such conflict, spirithosts often avoid large, unfamiliar towns, or disguise their ethereality from others.
	Spirithosts do not experience time in the same way as most mortal creatures. As a result, even though they mature in their teens, their lives can stretch on for hundreds of years.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Spirithost Names</name>

Male Names: Astras, Boreas, Cin'nilas, Cusnon, Fesim, Mesaron, Senvas, Servalas, Sesirops, Yalsin

Female Names: Amias, Belias, Heathimis, Lethreas, Nix'silia, Priscilla, Sayu, Shavaras, Sunda, Wishnas</text>

      <text>Humans are known for being ambitious, diverse, and extremely short-lived, but also have the dubious honor of having an abundance of near-human offshoots, for it seems humans can breed with just about anything. Near-humans are still basically humans, bearing subtly different traits from a wide variety of sources, and are individually rare but make up a surprisingly large portion of any human population.
	Near-humans come in all shapes and sizes and from all walks of life. They are the barest expression of human diversity: human offshoots from all corners of the world.

One of your parents was a human and the other was a dwarf. Such a pairing is unlikely to have produced offspring, but you have defied the odds to join the ranks of the sturdy and resilient muls.

      <text>Humans are known for being ambitious, diverse, and extremely short-lived, but also have the dubious honor of having an abundance of near-human offshoots, for it seems humans can breed with just about anything. Near-humans are still basically humans, bearing subtly different traits from a wide variety of sources, and are individually rare but make up a surprisingly large portion of any human population.
	Near-humans come in all shapes and sizes and from all walks of life. They are the barest expression of human diversity: human offshoots from all corners of the world.

Your large nose, strong jaw, and wide head do much to reveal your distantly bovine nature, but the prominent bull-horns atop your head reveal to all that you are half-minotaur. Taurans tower over most people and can solve mazes with ease, but typically possess only a shadow of their minotaur parent's might.

Carefree and constantly possessed of wanderlust, the extraordinarily pale windswept embody their connection to Elemental Air. Windswept humans are never likely to sleep in the same bed for two nights in a row; they are always moving, always exploring, and always following the wind. You are lighter than a normal human, capable of floating gently on the breeze, and have faint inborn power over the winds.

      <text>Hastily the frazzled human scrambled down the alleyway. He was the king of the back pathways, and none would dare challenge him. None, except the thing that now trailed behind him. A creature of nightmares. A Fallen. A monstrosity with a body of flames. He cuts left, then right. But still he hears the footsteps behind him. And in no time, the monster's light covers his whole body. This was the end. He knew it.

The vampire delighted himself, draining the blood from the foolish adventurer that thought that she alone could end his empire. As he did, the blood's taste felt foul, even for an undead. The corpse of the fallen warrior started to convulse with shadows darkening her skin, covering her completely. The vampire jumped a few steps back, trembling in fear knowing what was happening. The Tiefling got up and simply stared at the monster that had killed her, creating a sword out of the shadows from her new body.

The Fallen, a people who were brought back to life by non-traditional means. They weren't resurrected by a powerful spell caster, divine intervention or by a necromancy ritual, but by their own raw emotions. Anger. Failure. Fulfillment. Pride and Revenge; All feelings which can alter the course of someone's life are enough to bring back another, and even more powerful than before.

The representation of resurrection by anger. Being revived by the most negative emotion brings the most negative effects over the Fallen's body. Being nothing but bones, necromancy thrives within them. They are often mistaken for simple mindless skeletons, even by other reanimated undead.

      <text>A Fallen's memory persists when reanimated, the transformation and awakening from their previous race into their current state took barely an instant from their point of view. And for that reason, their emotions are as strong as ever.

The following table provides suggestions for how your character awakened and became a Fallen.

Fallen's Awakening:
1d6 | Objective
1 | You were backstabbed by a most trusted friend, all because of money and glory. At your dying breath you swore to bring down everything they had built.
2 | Your daughter was taken away by a Hag, and you didn't stand a chance against it. Even in this new form, you must save her before it is too late.
3 | You made a promise or an oath and don't have any intention of breaking it, even after death.
4 | You were once a powerful king from a long forgotten past. At your deathbed you had promised to make your kingdom prosper, but it's long since been reduced to ashes.
5 | You discovered a dark secret, but were killed because of it. You must stop it before something bad happens.
6 | You died on a battlefield and broke your promise to return home. However, in this new form would they still love you?</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Uncertain Future</name>
      <text>After a Fallen completes its quest, the sensation of emptiness emerges inside their mind and soul. The ones who were able to fulfill their quest may sometimes abandon their position as warriors and become hermits, isolating themselves from all the world around them, waiting for its end.

However, those who's hearts still want to fight for something continue their position as warriors until outmatched by a stronger opponent, finally being able to rest once and for all.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Fallen Names</name>
      <text>Fallen usually either keep the name they had in life, either to show they're back from the grave or to be remembered. But some of them choose different names that exude power or intimidate others, always resembling their subspecies.

Examples of such names are:
Haunt, Lilith, Reaper, Revan, Shadow, Wraith.</text>

      <text>A Fallen's age is indefinite. So long as their body persists, it can maintain a life force.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Most Fallen are chaotic in nature, finding it difficult to control their emotions. However, they are usually good or evil, rarely neutral.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Size</name>
      <text>Fallen almost always inhabits the body of a humanoid creature, making their size roughly the same size as the body their soul inhabits. Choose a race and use their same size category.</text>

      <name>Perennial Nature</name>
      <text>You walk within the thin line of the living and the dead. This is represented by the following:

	• You are an Undead, but can be targeted by healing magic or any other effect that would affect a Humanoid.

	• You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.

	• You add your Proficiency Bonus to death saving throws.

	• You don't need to eat, drink or breathe.

	• When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state rather than sleeping. In this state you appear inert but it doesn't render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.</text>

      <text>A Fallen's memory persists when reanimated, the transformation and awakening from their previous race into their current state took barely an instant from their point of view. And for that reason, their emotions are as strong as ever.

The following table provides suggestions for how your character awakened and became a Fallen.

Fallen's Awakening:
1d6 | Objective
1 | You were backstabbed by a most trusted friend, all because of money and glory. At your dying breath you swore to bring down everything they had built.
2 | Your daughter was taken away by a Hag, and you didn't stand a chance against it. Even in this new form, you must save her before it is too late.
3 | You made a promise or an oath and don't have any intention of breaking it, even after death.
4 | You were once a powerful king from a long forgotten past. At your deathbed you had promised to make your kingdom prosper, but it's long since been reduced to ashes.
5 | You discovered a dark secret, but were killed because of it. You must stop it before something bad happens.
6 | You died on a battlefield and broke your promise to return home. However, in this new form would they still love you?</text>

      <text>After a Fallen completes its quest, the sensation of emptiness emerges inside their mind and soul. The ones who were able to fulfill their quest may sometimes abandon their position as warriors and become hermits, isolating themselves from all the world around them, waiting for its end.

However, those who's hearts still want to fight for something continue their position as warriors until outmatched by a stronger opponent, finally being able to rest once and for all.</text>

      <name>Fallen Names</name>
      <text>Fallen usually either keep the name they had in life, either to show they're back from the grave or to be remembered. But some of them choose different names that exude power or intimidate others, always resembling their subspecies.

Examples of such names are:
Haunt, Lilith, Reaper, Revan, Shadow, Wraith.</text>

      <name>Perennial Nature</name>
      <text>You walk within the thin line of the living and the dead. This is represented by the following:

	• You are an Undead, but can be targeted by healing magic or any other effect that would affect a Humanoid.

	• You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.

	• You add your Proficiency Bonus to death saving throws.

	• You don't need to eat, drink or breathe.

	• When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state rather than sleeping. In this state you appear inert but it doesn't render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.</text>

      <text>You have resistance to fire damage and immunity to Extreme Cold.
	Moreover, the flames from your body harms neither you nor your equipment and emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. You can use your bonus action to expand or reduce its radios of bright and dim light by up to 10 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet or a minimum of 10 feet each.
	At 5th level, if any of this area of light overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.</text>

      <text>Hastily the frazzled human scrambled down the alleyway. He was the king of the back pathways, and none would dare challenge him. None, except the thing that now trailed behind him. A creature of nightmares. A Fallen. A monstrosity with a body of flames. He cuts left, then right. But still he hears the footsteps behind him. And in no time, the monster's light covers his whole body. This was the end. He knew it.

The vampire delighted himself, draining the blood from the foolish adventurer that thought that she alone could end his empire. As he did, the blood's taste felt foul, even for an undead. The corpse of the fallen warrior started to convulse with shadows darkening her skin, covering her completely. The vampire jumped a few steps back, trembling in fear knowing what was happening. The Tiefling got up and simply stared at the monster that had killed her, creating a sword out of the shadows from her new body.

The Fallen, a people who were brought back to life by non-traditional means. They weren't resurrected by a powerful spell caster, divine intervention or by a necromancy ritual, but by their own raw emotions. Anger. Failure. Fulfillment. Pride and Revenge; All feelings which can alter the course of someone's life are enough to bring back another, and even more powerful than before.

The representation of resurrection by failure. The ones who died failing their duty, failing to protect their home. Their bodies are covered in shadows, with glimpses of neon lights that shine through their eye sockets and chest, utilizing these magical shadows for their own advantage.

	For a year and a day he taught me the ways of the wood, slowly nurturing my druidic potential. Sometimes I still see those ancient green eyes in my dreams. Though I have grown old, I know that the gardener is still out there in the forest of my people, quietly singing to himself as he tends to the trees.

      <text>Deep in the forests of the world dwell a forgotten people, the Entlings. They are the ancient caretakers of the forest who awoke at the dawn of the world. To many, they are creatures of myth and folktale, reclusive tree-like people with skin like bark and hair that resembles tree-tops and verdant gardens. Though these gardeners are few in number, they are very much real, though they prefer to be forgotten.

They carefully maintain the natural order of the ecosystems they dwell in, culling creatures that grow to numerous, nurturing those on the brink of extinction, and all the relationships in between.
	Though rarely roused to action, Entlings who strike out into the world often do so to protect the forests under their protection. Though slow to anger, their fury knows no bounds when evil or blight threatens the groves that they have raised from seedlings. Entlings who leave the forest usually find it difficult to fit in amongst civilized settlements, and usually struggle to understand the norms and customs of normal folk.

      <text>From atop the great walls of Hammerdeep I watched as the young half-dwarf disappeared into the swamp. Based on talent along, he should have been chosen as apprentice to the master smith of the great walled city. Sadly, due to his human mother, the young smith had been passed over for a less skilled, but full-blooded dwarf.
	I always admired how he refused to stoop to the menial work delegated to half-dwarves, and I was determined to help him earn the right to use the clan name of his father. I knew the task would be dangerous, especially to a dwarf with so little experience as a warrior, but if the he could succeed in slaying the young dragon that had taken up residence in the swamp, the elders would have no choice but to accept him.

	Often, when a clan has risky or nefarious business to take care of, they will task a half-dwarf with taking care of things. That way, should things go poorly, dishonor is not brought upon a full-blooded member of the clan.

	The warrior's skin was a pale blue and his eyes flickered with a strange maroon light. As he took survey of himself, he seemed stronger, almost as if some strange new power was flowing through his veins.
-Lord Tormund Shadowfall
Paladin of the Sacred Fire

      <text>While most spend their lives searching for purpose, Magen come with that purpose woven into their very being. Created by powerful mages to fulfill a specific duty, Magen physically resemble adult humanoids, but pale bluish skin and maroon eyes set them apart. Their innate magic allows them to live without the food, air, and water required by mortals, but their innate magic makes them susceptible to anti-magic effects.</text>

      <name>Loyal Servants</name>
      <text>While the typical Magen is fiercely loyal to their creator, even to death, those that become adventurers are those that have thrown off the yoke of servitude. When you create a Magen, consider why they struck out into the world. Are they seeking a purpose greater than the duty they were created for?</text>

      <text>Every fairy I've ever met has been irritating beyond belief, and I cannot fathom why the Prince of Winter hasn't expelled the little buggers from his court completely. Sure, their small stature and tiny wings allow them to access places that I certainly couldn't, and their skill with illusion magic does come in handy more often than I'd like to admit. Actually, now that I think about it, they do seem to have their uses. Maybe I need to give these tricksters another chance.

      <name>Fleeting Fancies</name>
      <text>Fairies may be the most spontaneous creatures in existence, constantly moving from one interest to the next as something new or exciting catches their attention. They are curious to a fault, and love to experience new things whenever they have the chance. When a fairy puts their mind to something, they put everything they have into their pursuits. Though it may not last, the determination of a fairy knows no bounds.</text>

    <trait category="description">

      <text>All Fairies begin their lives in the service of one of the Courts of the Feywild, and the Archfey they serve is the closest thing many of them will have to a parent. The longer a fairy spends in the presence of an Archfey, the more they start to resemble them. Those who have spent lifetimes in the service of a Fey Court often come to resemble miniature versions of Archfey, in appearance and manner. While in the Feywild, Fairies stop maturing, both physically and emotionally, when they reach adulthood, allowing them a strange perpetual immortality.

The fairies who reject a life of unchanging servitude most often do so to become adventurers on the material plane, where they can age and develop normally. Fairy adventurers often pursue their knack for illusion magic as bards, wizards, or sorcerers, though some strike pacts and become warlocks.</text>

In most worlds, humans are the most numerous of the mortal races, and their grit and adaptability allow them to succeed in all but the most hostile environments. Humans can be found in almost any city, town, or hamlet. They live in large social groups, and most humans dwell in permanent settlements.
	Astute humans are those, that have spent their lives honing their mental abilities. They tend to become highly specialized experts in certain subjects, ignoring all other areas of study for the sake of mastery. Some become sages, learning all they can from tomes and scrolls. Others sit at the feet of the wise, seeking to emulate the elders of their clan or temple. And still others master the persuasive arts, honing their social skills.

Humans can be found in almost any city, town, or hamlet. They live in large social groups, and most humans dwell in permanent settlements.

Some humans never settle down, and instead spend their lives learning to do a bit of everything. These wanderers are known as Generalists. They become restless if they stay in one place for too long, so they spend their lives experiencing as many things as they possibly can. Generalists usually find their way in the world as wandering entertainers, sell swords, or hired hands. Their desire to experience foreign lands and new cultures often leads them to pursue a life of adventure.

      <text>Palefang stepped forward into the circle that was already forming around him. He had left the village two moons ago as a hatchling, determined to return and prove his strength. He now sought to challenge the aging chieftain for his position as leader of the clan. The rival lizardfolk he had slain earlier that day had strengthened his reputation enough that the chieftain did not think it disgraceful to accept his challenge. If he won, Palefang would wrest control of the clan, and the other hatchlings would be forced to respect him. As the circle of lizardfolk closed around him and the chieftain, Palefang drew his bone dagger. The chieftain let out a guttural hiss and dropped his cloak from his shoulders, revealing a scaled body covered in scars. The noise of the tribe grew louder and louder in his ears, and for the first time in a long time, Palefang knew fear.

Above all else, Desert Dwelling lizardfolk are cowards. After hundreds of years of being hunted by desert predators these frilled reptilians are few in number, living in tribes less than ten members strong. They always settle in locations with many escape routes should they be attacked while resting.

Their need to prove themselves in battle makes them dangerous neighbors, and they are constantly involved in tribal warfare. Their culture of war has prevented them from advancing past their primitive ways.

Unlike most humanoids, they do not form familial bonds, instead bonding with their tribe. Any lizardfolk would risk their life to protect the hatchlings of their tribe.

Grassland Dwelling lizardfolk are brutish tribes of raiders and marauders. They live together in large hordes, and move through their territory as nomadic tribes. Despite a warlike lifestyle, their biggest threat comes from within their ranks. Their leaders are constantly challenged for control, and many of their strongest are slain during internal power struggles.

By far the most common, Swamp Dweller lizardfolk live in and around great bodies of water. These semi-aquatic folk form small tribes that come together during the full moon to take care of tribal affairs. Unlike most lizardfolk, only resort to violence when it is necessary for their survival.

      <text>Changelings are a humanoid race of shapechangers who conceal their true identities behind false faces. Their gifts of mimicry allow them to appear as members of any humanoid culture, playing the part of a dwarf one day and a dragonborn the next. Although changelings can adopt any guise, most rely on a few established personas, each with a developed history and a network of friends and acquaintances.

      <text>Savage and terrifying, trolls stalk nearly every world in the D&amp;D multiverse. While there are many variations, even within a single world, trolls are usually monstrous creatures that prey upon helpless travelers and serve as adversaries to be slain by adventures.

However, sometimes the occasional troll breaks away from the tendencies of its kin and strikes out to make its own fate, often becoming a wandering adventurer. In some settings, trolls overall are less monstrous and prone to evil, resulting in many who regularly interact with other races and take up a life of adventuring.

Other trolls have more modest regeneration abilities, which can wane if overtaxed. Nearly all troll regeneration can be halted by fire and acid, and trolls are naturally wary of such elements.

The regenerative abilities of trolls are thought to be responsible for their ability to rapidly mutate and adapt to new environments.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>In the world of Krynn, the setting of the Dragonlance saga, minotaurs live in an honor‐
based society where strength determines power in both the gladiatorial arenas and in daily life. At home on both land and sea, the minotaurs of Krynn are ferocious sea raiders who rank as the ablest and most dangerous sailors in the world.

Source:	Unearthed Arcana: Waterborne Adventures p. 1</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Arrogant Conquerors</name>
      <text>Minotaurs embrace the notion that the weak should perish and that the strong must rule and that they themselves are the strongest and most powerful race on Krynn. They believe their destiny is to rule the world, and that their dominion will be one of conquest and military might. To that end, all minotaurs are trained in weapons, armor, and tactics from a young age.
	The minotaurs' arrogance stems from a combination of strength, cunning, and intellect three virtues they hold dear, and which they deem the foundation of their greatness. They believe that this combination of traits is what sets them apart from their rivals.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Trial by Combat</name>
      <text>Minotaur society is built on the principle that might makes right, and that considerations of justice are unnecessary. The minotaurs are led by an emperor served by a council of eight minotaurs called the Supreme Circle. All posts within the government, including the emperor's, are won by the strongest and cleverest minotaurs, as proved by combat in the Circus.
	The Circus is the only means by which a minotaur can rise in society. It is a grand, annual display of single combat in which minotaurs battle each other for supremacy. Minotaur youths must prove themselves in the Circus to earn their passage to adulthood.
	Participation in the Circus is yet another reason why minotaurs look down on other folk. To the minotaurs, death and glory in battle are a natural process. Combat is the key to ensuring that the strong survive, and that the weak are set aside before they can undermine their superiors'
grand schemes of conquest.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Honor above All</name>
      <text>For all their cruelty, minotaurs are bound by a powerful sense of honor. Each victory brings greater honor to both individual minotaurs and their families. Defeat invokes a stain that only death can fully wash away.
	Honor demands that minotaurs keep their word once it is offered, and each minotaur remains faithful to friends and clan above all else. Minotaurs rarely befriend folk of other races, as they all too often encounter them only in battle. If a minotaur does strike up a friendship, it is typically with other creatures that display the minotaurs' virtues and love of battle. To such friends, a minotaur becomes an ally whose support will never waver.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Sea Reavers</name>
      <text>In the world of Krynn, the minotaurs rule a chain of islands dominated by the isles of Mithas and Kothas. Bound by the sea on all sides, the minotaurs focused their tenacity, strength, and cunning to become some of the most skilled and ferocious mariners in the world. They range across the water in their ships, raiding and pillaging as they wish. Minotaurs sometimes engage in trade, but they much prefer to take what they want by force. After all, as the strongest of all folk, they deserve the treasures and goods that lesser creatures have gathered.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Minotaur Bonds</name>
      <text>When creating a minotaur character rooted in Krynn (or in any campaign that draws on the backstory presented here), you can use the following table of bonds to help flesh out your character. Use this table in addition to or in place of your background's bond or a bond of your creation.

Minotaur Bonds:
d6 | Bond
1 | My opponent in the Circus for my trial of adulthood was chosen years ago. Though we sparred only once, I fell deeply in love. Rather than fight my beloved to the death, I fled from home and have been branded a coward.
2 | I'm the last of my clan. If I die without achieving great deeds, the hero who is my clan's patron will be forgotten.
3 | I was part of a raiding party that was defeated and enslaved. I've escaped and sworn revenge.
4 | I never shared my people's love of violence. I'm part of a conspiracy to topple the emperor's violent regime.
5 | I claim that I am an exile from my people, but in truth I have been sent to serve as a spy. I'm expected to leave secret messages telling my folk of villages and towns that are ripe targets for conquest.
6 | I'm the last survivor of a ship wrecked in a storm. Occasionally, the spirits of my shipmates appear in my dreams and ask me to complete tasks they left unfinished in life.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Minotaur Names</name>
      <text>Minotaur clan names originate with a great hero whose descendants take on that name as their own, doing their best to live up to the ideals of their ancestor. On Krynn, clan names are always preceded by the prefix "es‐" for minotaurs from lands controlled by the island of Mithas, or "de‐" for minotaurs from areas under the sway of Kothas.

Male Names: Beliminorgath, Cinmac, Dastrun, Edder, Galdar, Ganthirogani, Hecariverani, Kyris, Tosher, Zurgas

      <text>The Revenant subrace can be applied to any race that has a subrace, and replaces that race's existing subrace options. Alternatively, you can apply this new subrace to a race without subrace options using the modification options provided below.
	Your DM might also allow you to take this subrace for a slain character. In that case, your character rises from the dead with its original subrace replaced (or with the necessary modifications made to its base traits), filled with a determination to seek vengeance or complete its mission.</text>

      <name>Racial Adjustments</name>
      <text>For races that don't have subrace options, taking on the Revenant subrace means making changes to your character's base traits, as follows. (This playtest article provides options only for human and dragonborn characters. Any other races which do not have subrace options should not be used with these Revenant subrace rules.)

Human Revenant. If you want to play a human revenant, modify the human's Ability Score Increase trait to the following: Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1. If you use the variant human traits, remove the Skills trait and the Feat trait.

Dragonborn Revenant. If you want to play a dragonborn revenant, modify the dragonborn's Ability Score Increase trait to the following: Your Strength score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 1. Additionally, your Draconic Ancestry trait uses necrotic damage as its damage type, replacing the damage type that applies to your breath weapon and your damage resistance.</text>

	• If you are below half your hit point maximum at the start of your turn, you regain 1 hit point.

	• If you die, you return to life 24 hours after death. If your body is destroyed, you reform within 1 mile of the place of your death at a spot determined by the DM. If your equipment was also destroyed, you do not regain it.

	• You know the distance and direction between you and any creature involved in your goal, such as a person you seek vengeance against or someone you pledged to defend. This awareness fails if the creature is on another plane of existence.

When your goal is complete, you finally find rest. You die and cannot be restored to life.</text>

      <text>Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs | these common threads unite all dwarves.

Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a Revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

      <text>Your DM assigns a goal to you—typically, one related to your character's death. The goal must be a specific task you can complete, such as slaying an enemy or liberating an area and its people. Until you fulfill that goal, you gain the following benefits:

As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.
	Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh or grow crystals from their scalps.

Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a Revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

As an earth genasi, you are descended from the cruel and greedy dao, though you aren't necessarily evil. You have inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power. You tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action.
	Elemental earth manifests differently from one individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates. Earth genasi can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals. The most arresting have fissures in their flesh, from which faint light shines.

Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a Revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it.
	Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal- black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices might sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.

Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a Revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths—all of these things call to your heart. You wander freely and take pride in your independence, though others might consider you selfish.
	Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi's hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater.

Others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.

Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a Revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children's children will always be held accountable.

The tieflings connected to Nessus command the power of fire and darkness, guided by a keener than normal intellect, as befits those linked to Asmodeus himself.

The githyanki plunder countless worlds from the decks of their astral vessels and the backs of red dragons. Feathers, beads, gems, and precious metals decorate their armor and weapons | the legendary silver swords with which they cut through their foes.

Winter is the season of dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers. It is a time of sadness and regret, entered when eladrin are overcome with sorrow.

Spring is the season of cheerfulness and unfettered celebration, marked by merriment as winter's sorrow passes. Eladrin enter this state when overcome with joy.

Summer is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy. Eladrin enter this state when overcome with fury.

You may create personality traits and flaws for each of your seasons, reflecting an eladrin's tempestuous personality. You can roll on the following tables or read them for inspiration. To add some chaos to your character, you may roll on these tables each time you change seasons.

The Avariel are a race of winged elves. They are also known as the "winged folk" and the "al karak elam." These rare creatures were more common when the worlds of the multiverse were young, but frequent conflicts with dragons much reduced the winged elves' number. Still, a few colonies persist here and there in the Material Plane and on the Plane of Air.

Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.

The grugach of the world of Greyhawk shun contact with other folk, preferring the solace of the deepest forests and the companionship of wild animals. Even other elves draw their suspicion.
	The grugach tend toward chaos and neutrality. They feel no special duty to anyone beyond their own folk and the forest that is their home. Troubles beyond their borders are best kept there. At the same time, they harbor little ambition beyond a peaceful coexistence with nature.
	If anyone is fool enough to disturb a grugach realm, these elves take to arms and fight in earnest. Grugach master the basic weapons needed to hunt and forage in the wood. Every copse of trees becomes a sniper's nest, and each forest meadow is an ambush point. The grugach set pits filled with stakes, snares that leave an intruder helpless to grugach arrows, and other snares designed to kill rather than capture. The grugach fight to the death to preserve their realms.

The sea elves fell in love with the wild beauty of the ocean in the earliest days of the multiverse. While other elves traveled from realm to realm, the sea elves navigated the deepest currents and explored the waters across a hundred worlds. Today, they form small, hidden communities in the ocean shallows and the Plane of Water.

      <text>"Long ago there was a woman named Jes, and she had one hundred children. Her rivals conspired against her and swore to kill her children. Jes begged the Sovereigns for help, but their only answer was the wind and rain. In the depths of her despair, a lonely traveler took her hand. "I will protect your children if they follow my path. Let them wander the world. They may be shunned and feared, but they will never be destroyed." Jes agreed, and the traveler gave her his cloak. When she draped it over her children their old faces melted away, and they could be whoever they wanted to be. And so it remains. Though the Children are shunned by all, the gift of the Traveler protects them still."
— Chance, changeling priest

A changeling can shift its face and form with a thought. Many changelings use this gift as a form of artistic and emotional expression, but it is an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and others who wish to deceive. This leads many people to treat known changelings with fear and suspicion.

      <name>Hidden People</name>
      <text>Hidden People Changelings are spread across Khorvaire. Wherever humans can be found, there are changelings; the question is whether their presence is known.
	Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are born and raised in stable communities, where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Still others are part of the nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some of these clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander, following the unpredictable path of the Traveler.
	In creating a changeling adventurer, consider the character's relationships with the people around them. Does the character conceal their true changeling nature, or do they embrace it? Do they have connections to a changeling community or clan, or are they alone and in search of companions?</text>

      <text>In their natural form, changelings are slender and pale with colorless eyes and silver-white hair. A changeling can alter its physical appearance with a thought. While this can be used to deceive others, it is a natural form of expression for the changeling. A changeling shifts shapes the way others might change clothes. A casual shape—one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history—is called a mask. A changeling mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then never used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth. They build an identity over time, crafting a persona, with history and beliefs. This focused identity helps a changeling pinpoint a particular skill or emotion. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat. Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; there might be three healers in a community, but whoever is on duty will adopt the persona of Tek, the kindly old medic. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by previous users of the persona.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Changeling Names</name>
      <text>A changeling might use a different name for each mask and persona, adopting new names as easily as they develop new faces. The true name of a changeling tends to be monosyllabic; however, there are often accents to a changeling's name that are expressed through shapeshifting, something single-skins will likely miss. For instance, two changelings might have the name Jin, but one is Jin-with-vivid-blue-eyes and one is Jin-with-golden-cheeks.
	Changelings have a fluid relationship with gender, seeing it as one characteristic to change among many others.

      <text>"I am kalashtar, born of two worlds. Over a thousand years ago, my ancestor bound her bloodline to the spirit Kashtai, and I am a child of that union. Kashtai moves within me. Her memories come to me in dreams, and at times her voice whispers in the silence of my mind. As long as at least one of my sisters is alive, Kashtai will survive—and as long as she lives, she will fight ilLashtavar."
—Lakashtai, servant of the light

The kalashtar are a compound race created from the union of humanity with renegade spirits from the plane of dreams—spirits called the quori. Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. But there is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, and they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.

    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Bound to Spirits</name>
      <text>Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, shared by other members of their bloodline. Physically, kalashtar appear human, but the spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features. Their movements and body language are different from those of humans; most beings find it graceful, but to some it feels unnerving. The eyes of a kalashtar often glow when it is focused on a task or feeling strong emotions.
	The kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. A kalashtar might experience the relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants the kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors, while others are more contemplative or kind; a kalashtar player and DM can work together to determine the nature of the linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some—for instance, an orphan kalashtar raised among outsiders—might know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts.
	The bond to the spirit can cause some kalashtar to display unusual quirks of behavior. A kalashtar player can roll or select a trait from the following table.

Kalashtar Quirks:
d10 | Quirk
1 | You try to understand the motives and feelings of your enemies.
2 | You prefer using telepathy over speaking aloud.
3 | You feel a strong drive to protect the innocent.
4 | You apply dream logic to mundane situations.
5 | You discuss things out loud with your quori spirit.
6 | You suppress your emotions and rely on logic.
7 | You are strongly influenced by the emotions of those around you.
8 | You prefer to find nonviolent solutions to problems whenever possible.
9 | You are driven by a warrior spirit and will fight for any noble cause.
10 | You are obsessed with Dreaming Dark conspiracies.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Hunted by Nightmares</name>
      <text>The virtuous spirits tied to the kalashtar fled from the dream realm of Dal Quor to escape the evil spirits that dominate the realm. The rebel quori believe that through meditation and devotion, they can eventually change the fundamental nature of Dal Quor, shifting the balance from darkness to light. Thus, most kalashtar communities focus on acts of devotion to the faith known as the Path of Light. But the dark powers of Dal Quor have their own plans on Eberron. Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters are manipulating the people of Khorvaire and eliminating kalashtar whenever possible.
	Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by living in close-knit communities, focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. But some among the kalashtar feel obliged to seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or simply to protect the innocent however they can. There are some kalashtar who have grown up isolated from their kind, who know nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans may use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can often cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Kalashtar Names</name>
      <text>A kalashtar name is formed by the blend of a personal prefix tied to the name of the quori spirit within the kalashtar. Each spirit has a gender identity, but this may or may not match the gender identity of the kalashtar host. Thus, a female kalashtar might have what others would consider a masculine name, because she's tied to a spirit with a masculine identity. Kalashtar orphans are unlikely to know the names of their spirits and instead take names from the cultures they're raised in.

Male Quori Names: Hareth, Khad, Kosh, Melk, Tash, Ulad, Vash

Female Quori Names: Ashana, Ashtai, Ishara, Nari, Tana, Tari, Vakri

Kalashtar Names: Coratash, Dalavash, Dolishara, Halakosh, Khoratari, Koratana, Lanhareth, Molavakri, Nevitash, Sorashana, Torashtai, Valakhad, Vishara</text>

The warforged were built to fight in the Last War. The first warforged were mindless automatons, but House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced fully sentient soldiers, blending organic and inorganic materials. Warforged may be made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond the war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killing machine, or a visionary in search of purpose and meaning.

As an envoy, you were designed with a certain specialized function in mind. You might be an assassin, a healer, or an entertainer, to name a few possibilities. Envoys are the rarest of the warforged subraces, and yours could be a unique design.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Living Steel and Stone</name>
      <text>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. All warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. A sigil is engraved into the center of the forehead; this is unique to each warforged. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed. A juggernaut warrior is a massive brute sheathed in heavy steel plates, while a skirmisher can be crafted from wood and light mithral to grant it lithe and elegant movement.
	While they are formed from stone and steel, warforged are humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids. A warforged can focus its mind on its body as it rests, adjusting its shape and form to assume one of a few defensive postures. A warforged who expects heavy combat might focus on durability, while during a time of peace they might be content to adopt a lighter, less aggressive form.</text>

Warforged envoys, however, were designed to perform other functions. As an envoy, you have a skill, a tool proficiency, and a tool that's part of your body. When you make an envoy character, consider the following questions: What is your purpose? How does your skill and your tool reflect that purpose? What form does your integrated tool take? If you have embedded thieves' tools, for instance, are your fingers actually lockpicks, or can you produce keys from various parts of your body? The following characters are examples of Warforged with integrated tools.

Lute is a bard with the entertainer background; his namesake instrument folds out of his left arm.

Compass Rose is a wizard with the outlander background. A keen explorer, she uses her built-in cartographer's tools to record the paths she travels.

Masque is an infiltrator. A rogue with the charlatan background and an integrated disguise Kit, she was built to blend in and assassinate. Cannith built six Warforged of her design, and Masque has vowed to hunt down and destroy the other five.

In developing your integrated tool, remember that you must have your hands free to use it. Masque, the infiltrator mentioned above, doesn't shapeshift like a changeling; she has to manually adjust her appearance.</text>

The warforged were built to fight in the Last War. The first warforged were mindless automatons, but House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced fully sentient soldiers, blending organic and inorganic materials. Warforged may be made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond the war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killing machine, or a visionary in search of purpose and meaning.

You were built to scout the edges of battle and outmaneuver your enemies. You are lean and designed for speed.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Living Steel and Stone</name>
      <text>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. All warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. A sigil is engraved into the center of the forehead; this is unique to each warforged. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed. A juggernaut warrior is a massive brute sheathed in heavy steel plates, while a skirmisher can be crafted from wood and light mithral to grant it lithe and elegant movement.
	While they are formed from stone and steel, warforged are humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the Medicine skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids. A warforged can focus its mind on its body as it rests, adjusting its shape and form to assume one of a few defensive postures. A warforged who expects heavy combat might focus on durability, while during a time of peace they might be content to adopt a lighter, less aggressive form.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Warforged Personality</name>
      <text>The warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Throne hold gave them freedom, but many warforged struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures that created them.
	The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose—protecting allies, completing a contract, or other pursuits—and devote themselves to this task as they once did to war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings and their freedom. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.
	The typical warforged has a muscular, sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity in emulation of the creatures around them.</text>

Warforged Quirks:
d10 | Quirk
1 | You analyze (out loud) the potential threat posed by every creature you meet.
2 | You don't understand emotions and often misread emotional cues.
3 | You are fiercely protective of anyone you consider a friend.
4 | You often say the things you are thinking aloud without realizing it.
5 | You try to apply wartime tactics and discipline to every situation.
6 | You don't know how to filter your feelings and are prone to dramatic emotional outbursts.
7 | You don't understand clothing beyond its utility and assume that what a creature wears denotes its job and status.
8 | You are obsessed with your appearance, and constantly polish and buff your armor.
9 | You are deeply concerned with following proper procedures and protocols.
10 | War is the only thing that makes sense to you, and you're always looking for a fight.</text>

      <text>Many reptiles derive their body warmth and energy from the sun, but the humanoid viashino are fueled by an inner fire of zeal. Open with their emotions, viashino can be hot-tempered, but they are also quick to their hissing laughter, and they easily form close bonds of friendship.

      <name>Scaled Skin and Tail Blades</name>
      <text>Viashino resemble humanoid lizards covered in green, scaled skin and spiky protrusions. Their heads jut forward from their slender necks and bear huge mouths full of sharp teeth. Long, whiplike tails extend from their spines, lashing behind them—faster and faster as they grow more agitated. Their tails are tipped with bony blades they can use as weapons.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Fervent and Fiery</name>
      <text>Viashino are fiercely emotional and often violent, and their wizards and sorcerers favor fire spells that reflect their inner fire. They are most common among the Gruul Clans, especially the Slizt clan. Occasionally they put their zealous fire to use in the service of higher ideals, joining the Boros Legion. Other viashino instead pursue careers in the Izzet League, where they find a special role wielding Izzet-designed flamespewing scorchbringers.
	Like fire itself, viashino are quick to leap from one situation to another, and they are frequently destructive in the process. They enjoy brawling and often cause more injury than intended, thanks to their teeth and bladed tails.
	They're also easily distracted, jumping from one idea to another in an instant. Likewise, they're easily bored, and if nothing captures their attention, they'll do something interesting.</text>

Many fairies have a special physical characteristic that sets them apart from other creatures of their kind. For your fairy, roll on the Fey Characteristic table or choose an option from it. The Feywild is a wild place, so come up with your own characteristic if none of these fit your character.

1 | You have small wings like those of an insect.

      <text>Hobgoblins trace their origins to the Feywild, where they first appeared with their goblin and bugbear kin. That history has left its mark, for though hobgoblins are found throughout the Material Plane, they continue to channel an aspect of the Feywild's rule of reciprocity, which creates a mystical bond between the giver and the receiver of a gift.
	On some worlds, such bonds lead hobgoblins to form communities with deep ties to each other. In the Forgotten Realms, vast hobgoblin legions have emerged, with ranks upon ranks of devoted soldiers noteworthy for how effective they are at fighting as a unit.
	Hobgoblins are generally taller than their goblin cousins but not quite as big as bugbears. They have curved, pointed ears and noses that turn red or blue during displays of emotion.

	Rabbitfolk are bipedal, with the characteristic long feet of the animal they resemble and fur in a variety of colors. They share the keen senses and powerful legs of leporine creatures and are full of energy, like a wound-up spring. Rabbitfolk are blessed with a little fey luck, and they often find themselves a few fortunate feet away from dangers during adventures.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Native to the world of Krynn, Kender are diminutive Humanoids that look like humans with pointed ears and diverse appearances. Kender have a supernatural curiosity that drives them on to adventures big and small. This curiosity is said to be connected to the whimsical magic of the Feywild, that some believe kender have a high affinity for. Due to their curiosity, many kender have found themselves falling through gates and portals to other planes and worlds.
	Unknown to most mortals, a magical phenomenon surrounds a kender. Spurred by their curiosity and love for trinkets, curios, and keepsakes, a kender's pouches or pockets will be magically filled with these objects. No one knows where these objects come from, not even the kender. This has led many kender to be mislabeled as thieves when they fish these items out of their pockets.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Created by forces of planar law, glitchlings are winged, human-like creatures made from a merger of magic and machine. These explorers seek to learn all they can about the multiverse and its creatures. Some glitchlings then carry what they learn back to lawful planes, like Mechanus, to inform the orderly working of the multiverse. Others become enamored with travel and the peoples they encounter, and they seek to make a life of their own among the planes.
	Glitchlings begin their existences with rudimentary personalities. As they absorb information and experiences, their personalities grow, but many retain quirks associated with their lawful origins. You can roll or choose a quirk from the Orderly Quirk table or create your own.

Orderly Quirk:
d6 | Quirk
1 | I collect things, whether a specific kind of object or things made of a particular material.
2 | We think of ourselves as being a part of the collective, lawful forces of the multiverse and don't refer to ourselves as a singular being.
3 | I seek out new experiences so I can better understand the freedom of my existence.
4 | I preface things I say with a short description, such as: "observation," "interjection," or "query."
5 | I plan elaborate responses to every contingency, ready to execute at an instant's notice.
6 | I investigate people's intentions behind their actions, trying to solve the equation that guides them.
