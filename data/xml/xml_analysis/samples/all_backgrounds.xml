    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.
	Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. The Gods of the Multiverse section contains a sample pantheon, from the Forgotten Realms setting. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion
	• Languages: Two of your choice
	• Equipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp

      <text>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.
	You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.</text>

      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example.
2 | I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.

6 | I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods.

8 | I've spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Tradition. The ancient traditions of worship and sacrifice must be preserved and upheld. (Lawful)

d6 | Bond
1 | I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago.

3 | I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents died.

    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You have always had a way with people. You know what makes them tick, you can tease out their hearts' desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children's books. It's a useful talent, and one that you're perfectly willing to use for your advantage.
	You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise to deliver. Common sense should steer people away from things that sound too good to be true, but common sense seems to be in short supply when you're around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will surely cure that unseemly rash, this ointment — nothing more than a bit of fat with a sprinkle of silver dust — can restore youth and vigor, and there's a bridge in the city that just happens to be for sale. These marvels sound implausible, but you make them sound like the real deal.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Sleight of Hand
	• Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, forgery kit
	• Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a disguise kit, tools of the con of your choice (ten stoppered bottles filled with colored liquid, a set of weighted dice, a deck of marked cards, or a signet ring of an imaginary duke), and a belt pouch containing 15 gp

      <text>Charlatans are colorful characters who conceal their true selves behind the masks they construct.

3 | Somewhere out there, I have a child who doesn't know me. I'm making the world better for him or her.

      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong.
2 | I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me.
3 | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable — or where such things could be hidden.
4 | I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.
5 | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.
6 | I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.

1 | I'm trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.
2 | My ill-gotten gains go to support my family.
3 | Something important was taken from me, and I aim to steal it back.
4 | I will become the greatest thief that ever lived.
5 | I'm guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it.
6 | Someone I loved died because of 1 mistake I made. That will never happen again.

d6 | Flaw
1 | When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it.
2 | When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.
3 | If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it.
4 | I have a "tell" that reveals when I'm lying.
5 | I turn tail and run when things look bad.
6 | An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that.</text>

      <text>As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.
	Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.
	You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.</text>

      <text>Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world — until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career. They understand the value of hard work and the importance of community, but they're vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.

1 | Community. It is the duty of all civilized people to strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilization. (Lawful)
2 | Generosity. My talents were given to me so that I could use them to benefit the world. (Good)
3 | Freedom. Everyone should be free to pursue his or her own livelihood. (Chaotic)

d6 | Bond
1 | The workshop where I learned my trade is the most important place in the world to me.

4 | I pursue wealth to secure someone's love.
5 | One day I will return to my guild and prove that I am the greatest artisan of them all.

      <name>Feature: Discovery</name>
      <text>The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.
	Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.</text>

      <text>Some hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion, whereas others chafe against it and long for company. Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it, the solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideals. A few are driven slightly mad by their years apart from society.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I've been isolated for so long that I rarely speak, preferring gestures and the occasional grunt.

3 | The leader of my community had something wise to say on every topic, and I am eager to share that wisdom.
4 | I feel tremendous empathy for all who suffer.
5 | I'm oblivious to etiquette and social expectations.
6 | I connect everything that happens to me to a grand, cosmic plan.
7 | I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, becoming oblivious to my surroundings.
8 | I am working on a grand philosophical theory and love sharing my ideas.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Greater Good. My gifts are meant to be shared with all, not used for my own benefit. (Good)
2 | Logic. Emotions must not cloud our sense of what is right and true, or our logical thinking. (Lawful)
3 | Free Thinking. Inquiry and curiosity are the pillars of progress. (Chaotic)
4 | Power. Solitude and contemplation are paths toward mystical or magical power. (Evil)
5 | Live and Let Live. Meddling in the affairs of others only causes trouble. (Neutral)
6 | Self-Knowledge. If you know yourself, there's nothing left to know. (Any)

d6 | Bond
1 | Nothing is more important than the other members of my hermitage, order, or association.
2 | I entered seclusion to hide from the ones who might still be hunting me. I must someday confront them.
3 | I'm still seeking the enlightenment I pursued in my seclusion, and it still eludes me.
4 | I entered seclusion because I loved someone I could not have.
5 | Should my discovery come to light, it could bring ruin to the world.
6 | My isolation gave me great insight into a great evil that only I can destroy.

d6 | Flaw
1 | Now that I've returned to the world, I enjoy its delights a little too much.
2 | I harbor dark, bloodthirsty thoughts that my isolation and meditation failed to quell.
3 | I am dogmatic in my thoughts and philosophy.

    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.
	Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn't stand on its own — it's connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.
	Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?
	What's your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don't embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family's good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?
	Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?
	These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.

    <trait>
      <name>Feature: Position of Privilege</name>
      <text>Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.</text>

      <name>Variant Feature: Retainers</name>
      <text>You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds — responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world.
2 | The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity.
3 | No one could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that I am a cut above the unwashed masses.
4 | I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions.
5 | I don't like to get my hands dirty, and I won't be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations.
6 | Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk. We all have the same blood.
7 | My favor, once lost, is lost forever.
8 | If you do me an injury, I will crush you, ruin your name, and salt your fields.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Respect. Respect is due to me because of my position, but all people regardless of station deserve to be treated with dignity. (Good)
2 | Responsibility. It is my duty to respect the authority of those above me, just as those below me must respect mine. (Lawful)
3 | Independence. I must prove that I can handle myself without the coddling of my family. (Chaotic)
4 | Power. If I can attain more power, no one will tell me what to do. (Evil)

      <text>Often considered rude and uncouth among civilized folk, outlanders have little respect for the niceties of life in the cities. The ties of tribe, clan, family, and the natural world of which they are a part are the most important bonds to most outlanders.

d6 | Bond
1 | My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me.
2 | An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me.
3 | I will bring terrible wrath down on the evildoers who destroyed my homeland.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants.
2 | There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.
3 | I remember every insult I've received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who's ever wronged me.
4 | I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies.
5 | Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.

You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been part of a standing national army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.
	When you choose this background, work with your DM to determine which military organization you were a part of, how far through its ranks you progressed, and what kind of experiences you had during your military career. Was it a standing army, a town guard, or a village militia? Or it might have been a noble's or merchant's private army, or a mercenary company.

      <text>You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.</text>

      <text>You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor. You had no one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate. You've survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each.
	You begin your adventuring career with enough money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days. How did you come by that money? What allowed you to break free of your desperate circumstances and embark on a better life?

      <text>Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong.
2 | I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me.
3 | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable — or where such things could be hidden.
4 | I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.
5 | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.
6 | I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.
7 | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it.
8 | I blow up at the slightest insult.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Honor. I don't steal from others in the trade. (Lawful)

      <text>You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.</text>

3 | Creativity. The world is in need of new ideas and bold action. (Chaotic)
4 | Greed. I'm only in it for the money and fame. (Evil)
5 | People. I like seeing the smiles on people's faces when I perform. That's all that matters. (Neutral)

1 | My instrument is my most treasured possession, and it reminds me of someone I love.
2 | Someone stole my precious instrument, and someday I'll get it back.

      <text>Instead of an artisans' guild, you might belong to a guild of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers. You don't craft items yourself but earn a living by buying and selling the works of others (or the raw materials artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop. In some ways, the traveling merchant's life lends itself to adventure far more than the life of an artisan.

      <text>Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade. However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.

Guild Business:

As a member of your guild, you know the skills needed to create finished items from raw materials (reflected in your proficiency with a certain kind of artisan's tools), as well as the principles of trade and good business practices. The question now is whether you abandon your trade for adventure, or take on the extra effort to weave adventuring and trade together.</text>

      <name>Feature: Guild Membership</name>
      <text>As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.
	Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.
	You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.</text>

      <text>You spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate, a ruthless cutthroat who taught you how to survive in a world of sharks and savages. You've indulged in larceny on the high seas and sent more than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to you, and you've garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Perception
	• Tool Proficiencies: Navigator's tools, vehicles (water)
	• Equipment: A belaying pin (club), 50 feet of silk rope, a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random trinket on the Trinkets table in chapter 5), a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp

      <name>Feature: Bad Reputation</name>
      <text>If your character has a sailor background, you may select this background feature instead of Ship's Passage.

No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are in a civilized settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.</text>

Instead, your service to your hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe.
	You might have been part of the City Watch of Waterdeep, the baton-wielding police force of the City of Splendors, protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy nobility alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant defenders of Silverymoon, a member of the Silverwatch or even one of the magic-wielding Spellguard.
	Perhaps you hail from Neverwinter and have served as one of its Wintershield watchmen, the newly founded branch of guards who vow to keep safe the City of Skilled Hands.
	Even if you're not city-born or city-bred, this background can describe your early years as a member of law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have their own constables and police forces, and even smaller communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready to protect their community.

For years you labored under a dwarf master of the craft, enduring long hours and dismissive, sour-tempered treatment in order to gain the fine skills you possess today.
	You are most likely a dwarf, but not necessarily — particularly in the North, the shield dwarf clans learned long ago that only proud fools who are more concerned for their egos than their craft turn away promising apprentices, even those of other races. If you aren't a dwarf, however, you have taken a solemn oath never to take on an apprentice in the craft: it is not for nondwarves to pass on the skills of Moradin's favored children. You would have no difficulty, however, finding a dwarf master who was willing to receive potential apprentices who came with your recommendation.

Now you are ready to leave your home — not to abandon it, but to quest for new lore to add to its storehouse of knowledge.
	The most well known of Faerûn's fonts of knowledge is Candlekeep. The great library is always in need of workers and attendants, some of whom rise through the ranks to assume roles of greater responsibility and prominence. You might be one of Candlekeep's own, dedicated to the curatorship of what is likely the most complete body of lore and history in all the world.
	Perhaps instead you were taken in by the scholars of the Vault of the Sages or the Map House in Silverymoon, and now you have struck out to increase your knowledge and to make yourself available to help those in other places who seek your expertise. You might be one of the few who aid Herald's Holdfast, helping to catalogue and maintain records of the information that arrives daily from across Faerûn.

      <name>Factions of the Sword Coast</name>
      <text>The lack of large, centralized governments in the North and along the Sword Coast is likely directly responsible for the proliferation of secret societies and conspiracies in those lands. If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some possibilities.

The Harpers. Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harpers' ideals.

The Order of the Gauntlet. One of the newest power groups in Faerûn, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order's ideals, and the clergy of the order's patron gods.

The Emerald Enclave. Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods of nature.

The Lords' Alliance. On one level, the agents of the Lords' Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance's ideals.

The Zhentarim. In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren't necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the Zhentarim.</text>

These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.</text>

      <text>Almost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter along the Sword Coast or in the North have one thing in common: they live out their lives without ever traveling more than a few miles from where they were born.
	You aren't one of those folk.
	You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of Faerûn for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share.
	Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land's ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you've never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you're a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Perception
	• Tool Proficiencies: Any one musical instrument or gaming set of your choice, likely something native to your homeland
	• Languages: One of your choice
	• Equipment: One set of traveler's clothes, any one musical instrument or gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland that depict where you are in Faerûn, a small piece of jewelry worth 10 gp in the style of your homeland's craftsmanship, and a pouch containing 5 gp

      <name>Why Are You Here?</name>
      <text>A far traveler might have set out on a journey for one of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary. To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the table below or choose from the options provided. The following section, discussing possible homelands, includes some suggested reasons that are appropriate for each location.

Why you are here:
d6 | Reason
1 | Emissary
2 | Exile
3 | Fugitive
4 | Pilgrim
5 | Sightseer
6 | Wanderer</text>
      <roll description="Reason">1d6</roll>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Where Are You From?</name>
      <text>The most important decision in creating a far traveler background is determining your homeland. The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this background.

Evermeet. The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerûn. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your homeland.
	Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerûn for a purpose that benefits elven culture or society.

Halruaa. Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerûn who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can work magic.
	Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerûn for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa's many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods of magic.

Kara-Tur. The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerûn, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faerûn likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn't your true ethnicity, because that's the blanket term they use for everyone who shares your origin.
	The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerûn as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission was over.

Mulhorand. From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is a lien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerûn. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts of Faerûn.
	Those who leave behind Mulhorand's sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of your home.

Sossal. Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed in white.
	Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly important.

Zakhara. As the saying goes among those in Faerûn who know of the place, "To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more." Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn't unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faerûn for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as you have.
	You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your own deities.

The Underdark. Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you were a child.
	If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren't a native, your reason for leaving "home" probably has something to do with getting away from a bad situation.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Feature: All Eyes on You</name>
      <text>Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.
	You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.</text>

      <text>Choose or randomly determine your inheritance from the possibilities in the table below. Work with your Dungeon Master to come up with details: Why is your inheritance so important, and what is its full story? You might prefer for the DM to invent these details as part of the game, allowing you to learn more about your inheritance as your character does.
	The Dungeon Master is free to use your inheritance as a story hook, sending you on quests to learn more about its history or true nature, or confronting you with foes who want to claim it for themselves or prevent you from learning what you seek. The DM also determines the properties of your inheritance and how they figure into the item's history and importance. For instance, the object might be a minor magic item, or one that begins with a modest ability and increases in potency with the passage of time. Or, the true nature of your inheritance might not be apparent at first and is revealed only when certain conditions are met.
	When you begin your adventuring career, you can decide whether to tell your companions about your inheritance right away. Rather than attracting attention to yourself, you might want to keep your inheritance a secret until you learn more about what it means to you and what it can do for you.

      <text>You belong to an order of knights who have sworn oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faerûn has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities.
	Though the term "knight" conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faerûn don't restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren't limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order's cause.
	The "Knightly Orders of Faerûn" sidebar details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe allegiance to.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for your order

      <text>You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community — whether a lone settlement or a great nation — that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share their ideals.
	This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.</text>

      <name>Knightly Orders of Faerûn</name>
      <text>Many who rightfully call themselves "knight" earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor's Eternal Order or Mystra's Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faerûn who hear the word "knight" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations.

Knights of the Unicorn. The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriarch families in Baldur's Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue's tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their weaknesses.

Knights of Myth Drannor. Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falcon hand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they've begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant and honest.

Knights of the Silver Chalice.The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe's ethos is the nobility's right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to the crown.</text>

      <name>Mercenaries of the North</name>
      <text>Countless mercenary companies operate up and down the Sword Coast and throughout the North. Most are smallscale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in the North are described below.

The Chill. he cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as the home of numerous groups of goblinoids that have banded together into one tribe called the Chill. Unlike most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North and maintains relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out as warriors. Few citystates in the North are willing to field an army alongside the Chill, but several are happy to quietly pay the Chill to battle the Uthgardt, orcs, trolls of the Evermoors, and other threats to civilization.

Silent Rain. Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like. Prospective employers must leave written word (in Elvish) near Evereska, and the Silent Rain sends a representative if interested.

The Bloodaxes. Founded in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings of Moradin Soulforger. They began hiring out as mercenaries to whoever in the North would pay them. Since then the mercenary company has broadened its membership to other races, but every member is an exile, criminal, or misfit of some sort looking for a fresh start and a new family among the bold Bloodaxes.</text>

    <proficiency />
    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Before you became an adventurer, your life was already full of conflict and excitement, because you made a living tracking down people for pay. Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren't a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You're involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What's more, you aren't alone, as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed.
	You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of thieves' guilds and street gangs. You might be a "velvet mask" bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. The community where you plied your trade might have been one of Faerûn's great metropolises, such as Waterdeep or Baldur's Gate, or a less populous location, perhaps Luskan or Yartar — any place that's large enough to have a steady supply of potential quarries.
	As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn't fit with the group's objectives — but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your companions.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from among Deception, Insight, Persuasion, and Stealth
	• Tool Proficiencies: Choose two from among one type of gaming set, one musical instrument, and thieves' tools

1 | I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong.

5 | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Though you might have only recently arrived in civilized lands, you are no stranger to the values of cooperation and group effort when striving for supremacy. You learned these principles, and much more, as a member of an Uthgardt tribe.
	Your people have always tried to hold to the old ways. Tradition and taboo have kept the Uthgardt strong while the kingdoms of others have collapsed into chaos and ruin. But for the last few generations, some bands among the tribes were tempted to settle, make peace, trade, and even to build towns. Perhaps this is why Uthgar chose to raise up the totems among the people as living embodiments of his power. Perhaps they needed a reminder of who they were and from whence they came. The Chosen of Uthgar led bands back to the old ways, and most of your people abandoned the soft ways of civilization.
	You might have grown up in one of the tribes that had decided to settle down, and now that they have abandoned that path, you find yourself adrift. Or you might come from a segment of the Uthgardt that adheres to tradition, but you seek to bring glory to your tribe by achieving great things as a formidable adventurer.
	See the "Uthgardt Lands" section of chapter 2 for details on each tribe's territory and its activities that will help you choose your affiliation.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival
	• Languages: One of your choice
	• Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument or artisan's tools

      <text>Though this section details the Uthgardt specifically, either it or the outlander background from the Player's Handbook can be used for a character whose origin lies with one of the other barbarian tribes in Faerûn.
	You might be a fair-haired barbarian of the Reghed, dwelling in the shadow of the Reghed Glacier in the far North near Icewind Dale. You might also be of the nomadic Rashemi, noted for their savage berserkers and their masked witches. Perhaps you hail from one of the wood elf tribes in the Chondalwood, or the magic-hating human tribes of the sweltering jungles of Chult.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Feature: Uthgardt Heritage</name>
      <text>You have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe's territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of the rest of the North. You are familiar enough with any wilderness area that you can find twice as much food and water as you normally would when you forage there.
	Additionally, you can call upon the hospitality of your people, and those allied with your tribe, often including members of the druid circles, tribes of nomadic elves, the Harpers, and the priesthoods devoted to the gods of the First Circle.</text>

      <text>Use the tables for the outlander background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of an Uthgardt tribe.
	Even if you have left your tribe behind (at least for now), you hold to the traditions of your people. You will never cut down a still-living tree, and you may not countenance such an act being done in your presence. The Uthgardt ancestral mounds — great hills where the totem spirits were defeated by Uthgar and where the heroes of the tribes are interred — are sacred to you.
	Your bond is undoubtedly associated with your tribe or some aspect of Uthgardt philosophy or culture (perhaps even Uthgar himself). Your ideal is a personal choice that probably hews closely to the ethos of your people and certainly doesn't contradict or compromise what being an Uthgardt stands for.

1 | I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.

4 | I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature.
5 | I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won't save you from a hungry owlbear.

5 | I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.
6 | It is my duty to provide children to sustain my tribe.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants.
2 | There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.

4 | I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies.
5 | Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.

      <text>You are a scion of one of the great noble families of Waterdeep. Human families who jealously guard their privilege and place in the City of Splendors, Waterdhavian nobles have a reputation across Faerûn for being eccentric, spoiled, venal, and, above all else, rich.
	Whether you are a shining example of the reason for this reputation or one who proves the rule by being an exception, people expect things of you when they know your surname and what it means. Your reasons for taking up adventuring likely involve your family in some way: Are you the family rebel, who prefers delving in filthy dungeons to sipping zzar at a ball? Or have you taken up sword or spell on your family's behalf, ensuring that they have someone of renown to see to their legacy?
	Work with your DM to come up with the family you are part of — there are around seventy-five lineages in Waterdeep, each with its own financial interests, specialties, and schemes. You might be part of the main line of your family, possibly in line to become its leader one day. Or you might be one of any number of cousins, with less prestige but also less responsibility.

	This advantage enables you to live a comfortable lifestyle without having to pay 2 gp a day for it, or reduces the cost of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle by that amount.

	While many of your fellow prisoners fell to the dragon's insatiable fury over the coming months, you and your fellow "survivors" were spared only for a worse fate as one of the dragon's magical experiments, leaving you and those who survived the torture scarred and disfigured.
	What reasons the dragon had for releasing you few survivors, nobody knows. You only fear that those who died under his terrible claw were the lucky ones, and you and your fellow Dragonscarred are doomed for a fate worse than death.

      <text>Prior to the coordinated attack by the Maimed Virulence and her rebel Black Fist supporters, you were once a citizen or visitor to Phlan. While the trauma of your recent ordeal has greatly altered your motivations and perception of the world, your former life still clings to you and colors your mannerisms, behaviors, and outlook on life.

      <name>Feature: Dragonscarred</name>
      <text>Over a period of several months you were subject to magical and mundane torture at the claws of Vorgansharax and his minions. These experiments have left you horribly disfigured but mark you as a survivor of the Maimed Virulence.
	This affords you a measure of fame and notoriety, for those who know of your harrowing ordeal are keen to hear the tale personally but makes it difficult to disguise your appearance and hide from prying eyes. You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your companions. Nobles, scholars, mages, and those who seek to ferret out the secrets of the Maimed Virulence would all be keen to hear your tale of survival, and learn what secrets (if any) you might possess, and/or study your affliction with great interest.
	However, you fear that your afflictions are not completely mundane and that the Maimed Virulence may as yet have some nefarious reason for allowing your escape, as your scars burn with acidic fury and seem to writhe beneath your skin at times.

      <text>The taking of Phlan by Vorgansharax is a clear memory in your mind. You were going about your everyday business when the green dragon's forces spilled out of the sewers and assailed your home. Many of Phlan's citizens, young and old alike, were captured, killed, or offered as tribute to the Maimed Virulence. You, yourself were one of those captured. But, either with the help of adventurers or through your own wits and sheer determination, you escaped.
	Rather than flee the region, you've chosen to stay and fight. Finding refuge outside the town and the deadly thicket surrounding it, you strike out against the Tears of the Virulence and their monstrous allies. You've learned to survive in dire and desperate circumstances, with supplies running low and the arrival of reinforcements uncertain. You've grown accustomed to acting under the cover of night, dealing what blows you can to avenge the friends and family you lost within the currently occupied Phlan. You will drive Vorgansharax out, or you die trying.

The tribe would seasonally travel south into the Grass Sea and the Giant's Cairn, north into the Dragonspine Mountains, and even occasionally east across the Stojanow River to the borders of the Quivering forest.
	In your migrations, your people have come to know the stone giant tribes that populate the Giant's Cairn. The dragon cultists came to the hills one day — magic-users wearing purple and riding horrid beasts, black-clad warriors wearing wicked masks, and even soldiers from the nearby town of Phlan. Then the dragon called Vorgansharax arrived and laired in the hills, causing horrid thickets to grow and animals to act unusually. The cultists began raiding nomad camps for victims to offer to the wyrm. Eventually, the dragon moved on to attack Phlan, but life was never again the same for the nomads of the Ticklebelly Hills.

      <text>You are a down-on-your-luck miner from the Earthspur Mountains who is no stranger to hardship. You have spent a great deal of time living among the dwarves, goliaths, and denizens of the Underdark that also work mines in the area. At this point, you're just as comfortable working underground as above. You know how to read a seam, dicker for supplies with the deep gnomes, party with dwarves, and find your way back to the surface afterwards. Unfortunately, you haven't struck it rich... yet. Although you've come to Mulmaster looking for work, the tall peaks and deep mines of the Earthspurs still call to you.

    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Before becoming an adventurer, you were a successful merchant operating out Hillsfar, the City of Trade. Your family operated warehouses, organized caravans, managed stores, or owned a ship and has trade contacts throughout the Moonsea region, as well as up and down the length of the Sword Coast. Perhaps they import ore, uncut gems, untreated furs, or grain into the City of Trade, or they export fine cloth, faceted gems, fine furs, or Dragon's Breath, a brandy-like liquor. Regardless, you've largely given that life up for some reason and have chosen to seek adventure instead. Nevertheless, the training you received then, and perhaps the contacts you made, serve you well as an adventurer.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Persuasion
	• Tool Proficiencies: Vehicles (land) and vehicles (water)
	• Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a letter of introduction from your family's trading house, and a purse containing 25 gp

      <name>Feature: Factor</name>
      <text>Although you've left the day-to-day life of a merchant behind, your family has assigned you the services of a loyal retainer from the business, a factor, husbanding agent, seafarer, caravan guard, or clerk. This individual is a commoner who can perform mundane tasks for you such as making purchases, delivering messages, and running errands. He or she will not fight for you and will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if frequently endangered or abused. If he or she is killed, the family assigns you another within a few days. [Note: This feature is a variant of the Noble Knight's Retainers feature.]</text>

Once per game session, when adventuring in either of those areas, you can use those contacts to get information about the local area or to pass a message to someone in those areas, even across the great distance between the two areas.

    <proficiency>Perception, Stealth</proficiency>
    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Hillsfar is the City of Trade. However, the Great Law of Trade only protects "legitimate" trade, trade that passes through the city's sole gate, which the Red Plumes monitor and tax. And the Great Law of Humanity banishes non-humans from the city altogether. The two Great Laws create great demand and great risk for smugglers, who shepherd illicit goods and non-humans into and out of the city by secret routes. The Rogues Guild tightly controls all of this activity, taking its cut from sanctioned jobs and exacting punishment for independent jobs.
	Perhaps you trafficked Dragon's Breath (a brandy-like liquor) to avoid tariffs or contraband to avoid seizure, or maybe you are a human who sympathizes with the non-humans and worked as part of the network of secret routes and safe houses that helps them pass through Hillsfar. Either way, you have contacts in the smuggling community who can help you slip into and out of the city unnoticed, for a price.

      <text>You can call on your contacts within the smuggling community to secure secret passage into or out of Hillsfar for yourself and your adventuring companions, no questions asked, and no Red Plume entanglements. Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain they will be able to help on your timetable or at all. Your Dungeon Master will determine whether you can be smuggled into or out of the city. In return for your passage, you and your companions may owe the Rouges Guild a favor and/or may have to pay bribes. [Note: This feature is a variant of the Sailor feature.]</text>

      <text>As a member of the Boros Legion, you are subject to the orders of your superior officers. You go where the angels tell you to go, and you do what they command you to do, to the best of your ability. If you enjoy some measure of independence, it's either because you have proven yourself capable of working without close supervision or because you're a rebellious sort who is willing to disobey orders now and face the consequences later.
	As a soldier on the street, you are tasked with bringing dangerous threats like the Rakdos and the Gruul in line. You might contend with Rakdos performances gone horribly out of control, Gruul raids on outlying neighborhoods, shipments of rot-infested vegetation from the Golgari undercity, and violent uprisings among the guildless. At the same time, you might have to worry about Dimir spies infiltrating your leadership, overzealous or corrupt Azorius senators abusing the law at the expense of justice, Izzet experiments leveling city blocks, and Simic creations that break out of laboratories and wreak havoc through the Tenth District.</text>

      <text>You're a spy. Secrets and misinformation are your stock in trade. You skulk in the shadows, infiltrate other guilds, and steal the most precious secrets, whether they're written in locked journals or hidden away in someone's mind. Even you might not be aware of all the reasons behind the missions you carry out. Sometimes a mission's sole purpose is to conceal the motivation behind another strike performed in a different part of the city, or simply to spread fear.
	As part of your covert work for House Dimir, you maintain a false identity as a member of another guild. You can choose your secondary guild or roll to determine it randomly. This secondary guild membership determines a portion of your starting equipment and is also where most of your contacts come from. You infiltrate your secondary guild to learn its secrets, keep tabs on its activities, or perhaps undermine it from within.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Stealth
	• Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit
	• Languages: One of your choice
	• Equipment: A Dimir insignia, three small knives, a set of dark-colored common clothes, and the starting equipment of the background described in this chapter for your secondary guild

      <name>Feature: False Identity</name>
      <text>You have more than one identity. The one you wear most of the time makes you appear to be a member of a guild other than House Dimir. You have documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona and fit into the secondary guild.
	Whenever you choose, you can drop this identity and blend into the guildless masses of the city.
	Consider why you're embedded in the secondary guild. Create a story with your DM, inspired by rolling on the following table or choosing a reason that suits you.

d8 | Reason for Infiltration
1 | My parents belong to this guild, and I let them think I'm following in their footsteps.
2 | I've been assigned to track this guild's activities.
3 | I've been assigned to get close to an individual in this guild and learn their secrets.
4 | I've been assigned to recruit a new Dimir spy from the ranks of this guild.
5 | I was a member of this guild before the Dimir recruited me.
6 | I don't like what this guild stands for and want to destroy it from within.
7 | I secretly wish I could leave the Dimir and join this guild, but there is no escaping the Dimir.

For you, the spells on the Dimir Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

Dimir Guild Spells:
Spell Level | Spells
Cantrip | encode thoughts, mage hand
1st | disguise self, sleep
2nd | detect thoughts, pass without trace
3rd | gaseous form, meld into stone, nondetection
4th | arcane eye, freedom of movement
5th | modify memory

Your magic is meant to be subtle and undetectable, but it might pull shadows or clouds of mist around you as you cast your spells. Using the encode thoughts cantrip described below, you can turn a creature's thoughts (including your own) into a thought strand that others can potentially read, share, or steal. These thought strands are treated as valuable currency among the Dimir.</text>

1 | I discovered a secret I can't let anyone else uncover—including my guild superiors.
2 | I formed a close friendship or romance with someone in the guild I'm infiltrating.
3 | The Dimir agent who recruited me was unmasked and killed. My revenge on the killers will be thorough and painful.
4 | I spend as much time as I can in the Ismeri Library because I'm certain an information hub operates behind its facade. I want its secrets!

Dimir Contacts:

1 | I know a Dimir courier who relays messages to me from someone higher up the chain of command.
2 | I get orders from a shapeshifter I recognize only through a series of code phrases we exchange.
3 | An ostentatiously wealthy vampire is my secret guild superior, summoning me to a luxurious estate by means of coded messages.
4 | I have never met my guild contact, but I receive telepathic messages, usually in my dreams.
5 | I've never met my guild contact, but I get coded messages from a pattern of street lights and graffiti.
6 | I didn't discover the identity of my guild contact until after we had begun a romantic relationship.
7 | My superior maintains an elaborate identity as a young street urchin... unless it's all a lie, and I'm being sent on ridiculous missions by a twisted child.

      <text>As a Dimir adventurer, you are a member of the guild's network of spies, thieves, assassins, and mind mages that lurks behind the facade of the public guild. On the surface, House Dimir presents the appearance of a network of couriers, investigators, media reporters, and archivists, dealing in information and spreading news. But you and your peers trade in secrets. You use secret symbols, runes, and signals to surreptitiously communicate with other Dimir agents, often in plain sight.
	Like any good spy, you have multiple identities: your true face as an agent of House Dimir; a guildless identity; and a role as a member of another guild. Within that secondary guild, you might already be on a mission for House Dimir, assigned to spy on the guild, collect information about a person, or recruit another spy from the ranks of the guild. Or that guild could be a launching point for your real mission. Perhaps, for example, you were ordered to infiltrate the Azorius in hopes of gaining access to a notorious inmate in an Azorius prison.</text>

You have spent your life in the slow churn of that ecosystem, in the dark places of the city where the messy parts of existence are on display. There is little squeamishness among the Golgari, no fear of death or taboo about the dead, just a fierce affirmation of the cycle.

      <name>How Do I Fit In?</name>
      <text>As part of the Golgari Swarm, you are a specialized instrument of the greater body. Your orders, when you have such, come from the guildmaster by way of his chancellors, who carry his messages throughout the guild. The swarm relies on you to advance the greater good by protecting some part, however small, of its teeming existence. That responsibility doesn't mean you're indispensable; your eventual death is part of your purpose and function, too, and you'll be replaced even as your body provides nutrients to further the swarm's growth.
	A classic adventuring role for a member of the Golgari involves crawling through dungeon-like environments—the sewers and ancient vaults of the undercity—in search of treasures left behind by the dead. Sometimes you might be sent to find a specific item believed lost in a dangerous part of the undercity. At other times, you could be asked to collect samples of a specific fungus, retrieve a body floating in the muck of the sewers, or bring back whatever booty you can to help fill the swarm's coffers.
	You might gain enough renown to become a member of the Ochran, assigned to a variety of tasks concerning thievery, assassination, or the protection of important figures in your guild. You might steal something because the guild needs it, or because its loss will bring harm to another guild, hastening that group's decline. You could be assigned to kill an outspoken and active enemy of the Golgari, such as an overzealous Boros captain whose raids into the undercity have approached dangerously close to the swarm's inner sanctum. Or you could serve as a bodyguard to one of Guildmaster Jarad's high chancellors, escorting this figure through the undercity while being ready to intervene at a moment's notice if things go wrong.
	The shamans of the Golgari use their magic to accelerate the cycle of decay and regrowth. You might be sent to spread spores throughout an area that the Golgari want to claim as their territory or to convince the inhabitants of such a territory to abandon it. You might also contend with the ever-present threat of hostile monsters encroaching into Golgari-controlled regions.</text>

	You have a basic knowledge of the structure of buildings, including the stuff behind the walls. You can also find blueprints of a specific building in order to learn the details of its construction. Such blueprints might provide knowledge of entry points, structural weaknesses, or secret spaces. Your access to such information isn't unlimited. If obtaining or using the information gets you in trouble with the law, the guild can't shield you from the repercussions.</text>

      <name>Izzet Guild Spells</name>
      <text>Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

For you, the spells on the Izzet Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

Izzet Guild Spells:
Spell Level | Spells
Cantrip | produce flame, shocking grasp
1st | chaos bolt, create or destroy water, unseen servant
2nd | heat metal, rope trick
3rd | call lightning, elemental weapon, glyph of warding
4th | conjure minor elementals, divination, Otiluke's resilient sphere
5th | animate objects, conjure elemental

Your spells tend to be loud, flashy, or explosive, even when the effect is unremarkable. For example, when you open the portal of a rope trick spell, the portal might be outlined by harmless, showy sparkles.
	If you use an arcane focus, it probably takes the form of an intricate device that could include metal gauntlets, glass canisters, copper tubing, and leather straps attaching it to your body. The mizzium apparatus described in chapter 5 is a magical version of this gear.
	The chaos bolt spell is a favorite of Izzet spellcasters because of its unpredictable nature.</text>

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I have a hard time staying focused on... oh, and my brain tends to jump from one... did I mention focus?
2 | I get really excited about my ideas and I can't wait to talk about them and start putting them into practice and tinkering with them and I want to tell you about how exciting it all is!
3 | It's not magic—or anything, really—if you do it only halfway. Whatever I do, I give it all I've got.
4 | I do what my gut tells me.
5 | Life's an experiment, and I can't wait to see what happens.
6 | I pepper my speech with the incomprehensible jargon of my trade, like mizzium droplets inserted into a weird-field suspension.
7 | Great ideas are fine, but great results are what counts.
8 | If you can guess what I'm about to do, that means I've run out of imagination.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)
2 | Creativity. Half the world's troubles come from stodgy thinking, stuck in the past. We need innovative solutions. (Chaotic)

4 | I tend to ignore sleep for days when I'm conducting research, often at the expense of my own health and safety.
5 | I'm convinced there's not a soul in Ravnica, except maybe the great Niv-Mizzet, who can match my boundless intellect.
6 | I'm incapable of admitting a flaw in my logic.</text>

      <text>The prospect of immense wealth is the promise of membership in the Orzhov Syndicate. All of the guild's endeavors channel wealth from Ravnican society into the ranks of the Orzhov—and concentrates the spoils at the top of the hierarchy. As a functionary in that system, your best hope is to claim as much as possible of the money that passes through your hands on its way up, so that you can work your way into a more prominent position.
	Regardless of your past and the wealth of your family, your initial status with the guild is near the bottom, until you have proven your value.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Religion

      <text>The Selesnya Conclave is all about connections, so its members cultivate contacts throughout the guild. The guild also engages in energetic recruitment to draw converts from other guilds, and often these new guild members maintain friendships with former guild mates.
	Roll twice on the Selesnya Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Selesnya Contacts table.

Selesnya Contacts:
d8 | Contact
1 | A wise centaur trainer believed in me even though I was a terrible student.
2 | A good friend has risen to become a Ledev guardian.
3 | I left my former guild and joined the Selesnya along with a close friend.
4 | The dryad at the head of my enclave has taken an interest in my activities.
5 | A sibling is an instructor at the guild's training grounds.
6 | One of my parents is a votary, tasked with protecting the temple gardens at the Vitu-Ghazi guildhall.
7 | I had a romance with a well-known Selesnya healer.
8 | Trostani, the head of the guild and the voice of Mat'Selesnya, once welcomed me into her presence.

Non-Selesnya Contacts:

2 | A good friend, eager for action, left the Selesnya and joined the Boros.
3 | I had a relationship with a guild mate who turned out to be a Dimir agent.
4 | I know a disgruntled Golgari assassin who is ripe for recruitment.
5 | I'm friendly with a Gruul centaur who almost joined us a few years back.
6 | I once had a heated public argument with an Izzet chemister, and neither of us is allowed back into that restaurant.
7 | I paid off my debt to the Orzhov Syndicate, but my good friend was not so lucky and remains indebted to that guild.
8 | At a time of terrible grief in my life, a Rakdos performer made a mockery of my pain, leaving me with mixed feelings of sadness and humor.

      <name>How Do I Fit In?</name>
      <text>Although the guild teaches the importance of subjugating the individual will to the good of the conclave, it also celebrates the diversity of individuals, in the same sense that a field that produces different crops is healthier than one that yields a single crop. That principle applies to your skills as an adventurer. As long as your efforts are directed toward advancing the goals of the guild rather than your private agenda, you're allowed to put your talents to work in your unique way.
	That said, you must never lose sight of the fact that you are part of a larger community. That includes the whole guild, of course, but your ties to community start with your vernadi (enclave) and its voda (dryad leader). The dryads want to know what you're doing and what purpose it serves, and they act to curtail your actions—or even expel you from the guild—if they determine that you aren't serving Selesnya's best interests.</text>

That's the world you have been trying to grow in the laboratories of the Simic Combine. Nature is all about adaptation, evolution, and balance—but for it to keep up with the pace of advancing civilization, nature needs some help from biomancers and terraformers. If, along the way, you happen to create super-soldiers and mutant monsters that can bolster the combine's defenses against the schemes and ambitions of the other guilds, so much the better.

      <name>Feature: Researcher</name>
      <text>When you attempt to learn or recall a magical or scientific fact, if you don't know that information, you know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a Simic laboratory, or sometimes from an Izzet facility, a library, a university, or an independent scholar or other learned person or creature. Knowing where the information can be found doesn't automatically enable you to learn it; you might need to offer bribes, favors, or other incentives to induce people to reveal their secrets.
	Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an inaccessible place, or that it simply can't be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.</text>

For you, the spells on the Simic Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

Simic Guild Spells:
Spell Level | Spells
Cantrip | acid splash, druidcraft
1st | detect poison and disease, expeditious retreat, jump
2nd | alter self, enhance ability, enlarge/reduce
3rd | gaseous form, water breathing, wind wall

7 | I borrowed a lot of money from an Orzhov syndic to help finance my research.

      <name>How Do I Fit In?</name>
      <text>As a Simic adventurer, your mission likely aligns with the Adaptationist philosophy; the disagreements and tensions among the guilds will soon erupt into open conflict, and your guild needs your help to ensure that the Simic survive. That help might come in the form of defending against Golgari incursions into Simic zonots or shielding Simic research from Azorius intrusion. It could also involve more subtle, diplomatic work to maintain balance among the guilds, or subterfuge aimed at undermining another guild's grab for power.
	Self-improvement is also an important part of your mission. Anything you can do to make yourself more capable—whether learning a new spell or adopting a new hybridizing mutation—gives the Simic a stronger weapon in its arsenal. The combine must change to survive, and that means individual members of the guild must grow and adapt as well.</text>

      <text>You are acquainted with a network of smugglers who are willing to help you out of tight situations. While in a particular town, city, or other similarly sized community (DM's discretion), you and your companions can stay for free in safe houses. Safe houses provide a poor lifestyle.

Claim to Fame:
d6 | Accomplishment
1 | Spirit of the Whale. You smuggled stolen dwarven spirits in the body of a dead whale being pulled behind a fishing boat. When you delivered the goods, the corpse suddenly exploded, sending whale meat and whiskey bottles for half a mile.
2 | Cart and Sword. You drove a cart filled with stolen art through the middle of a battlefield while singing sea shanties to confuse the combatants.
3 | The Recruit. You enlisted in another nation's navy for the purpose of smuggling stolen jewels to a distant port. You attained a minor rank before disappearing from the navy and making your way here.
4 | River of Shadows. Your riverboat accidentally slipped through the veil into the Shadowfell for several hours. While you were there, you sold some stolen dragonborn artifacts before returning to this plane and paddling home.
5 | Gold-Hearted. You agreed to transport a family escaping a war. The baby began to cry at a checkpoint, and you gave the guards all your gold to let you pass. The family never found out about this gesture.
6 | Playing Both Sides. You once smuggled crates of crossbow bolts and bundles of arrows, each destined for an opposing side in a regional war, at the same time. The buyers arrived within moments of each other but did not discover your trickery.</text>

      <text>Your family name strikes fear and admiration in the hearts of the common folk—but that's got nothing to do with you. Songs and stories celebrating the adventuring exploits of your famous parent are widely known. Kids across the land grew up wishing they were you. But being the child of a famous adventurer wasn't all hugs and kisses.
	You seldom saw your celebrity-adventurer parent, and when they were around, it was all about them and tales of slaying this demon or vanquishing that dragon. All too often, you'd be woken out of a sound sleep by someone standing outside your home screaming about the latest threat to the town, the region, or the world.
	In the end, all you have to show for your lineage is your name. Most of the family's money went for consumables, from potions of healing and spell scrolls to copious amounts of dwarven ale. And everyone expects you to swing a sword or sling spells like your famous forebear, making it doubly hard for you to prove yourself.

The art of business is the art of finding the best path to profit, and that path might be different with each transaction. It takes a strong mind and a stronger stomach to succeed. So why did you fail?

4 | If I take care of my possessions, they'll take care of me. People come and go, but a weapon or a wand is something you can always rely on.
5 | Although my business failed, the people of my community were kind to me. I'll do everything in my power to protect them.
6 | I owe a dangerous person a lot of money. As long as they're happy, they let my debt rest unpaid.

8 | It's only a matter of time before I'll be upper management. I just have to kiss up to my superiors and kick down those beneath me.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Advancement. Money and power can be gained more easily within an organization. I plan to gain as much as possible. (Evil)
2 | Structure. Life goes much more smoothly when you follow the rules and work within a system. (Lawful)
3 | Uncertainty. The more chaos that swirls around me, the more opportunities I can find to profit. (Chaotic)
4 | Justice. I can't stand people being treated unjustly. I do whatever it takes to stop injustice and those who flout the law. (Lawful)
5 | Pleasure. What's the use of working hard and making money if you can't enjoy the finer things in life? (Any)
6 | Power. Money is fine, but real power means never having to say you're sorry. (Evil)

d6 | Bond
1 | I have a family member in need. I consider them in everything I do.
2 | My peers keep me grounded.
3 | My past mistakes cost someone else dearly. I have to rectify that.
4 | A childhood mentor put me on my current path. If I succeed, I want to repay that mentor in some way.
5 | I value an oath of loyalty I took to a group of friends over everything else in my life.
6 | Although I don't get along well with people, my pet means the world to me.

      <text>It's said that every faith in the world has a believer in Baldur's Gate. Not only are most established faiths tolerated — even if some of them, including most of the openly evil faiths, are relegated to the Outer City's Twin Songs neighborhood — but new ones arrive constantly, carried by travelers and proselytizers from far-flung lands. A character with this background might aspire to greater things, not for themselves, but for their faith.

      <text>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.
	You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.</text>

	You're tightly connected with the religious community of Baldur's Gate. You know if a deity has a following in the city and any places that faith openly congregates and the neighborhoods those faithful typically inhabit. While this isn't remarkable for most of the city's larger faiths, keeping track of the hundreds of religions newcomers bring with them is no mean feat.</text>

      <text>Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

	You're well-versed in the mannerisms and idiosyncrasies of Baldurian patriars and other nobles, imitating them smoothly enough to convince even the snootiest family heads of your authenticity. You're skilled at posing as the long-lost heir to some imaginary or extinguished patriar lineage.
	Because of your skill in passing yourself off as a patriar, you have a Watch token that allows you alone into the Upper City of Baldur's Gate. You might be able to bluff others through with you, or even convince members of the Watch that you're a patriar. However, any true test of your authenticity is likely to reveal your deception.</text>

      <text>No career criminal in Baldur's Gate operates without being aware of the Guild.

A few former Guild members have been cast out of the organization due to incompetence or after offending a more powerful member, and now shuffle for scraps to survive.

	In Baldur's Gate, crime is just another business. As a result, you can arrange a meeting with a low-ranking operative of nearly any business, patriar family, crew, government institution, or—certainly—the Guild. This operative will hear you out and, at their discretion, take your information or request up their chain of command. These meetings almost always occur in shady venues.</text>

      <name>Criminal Origins</name>
      <text>Criminals are pervasive in Baldur's Gate. If you wish, you may roll on the Criminal Origins table for an event that began your life of crime.

Criminal Origins:
d8 | Origin
1 | You crippled a Guild kingpin's cousin without realizing the connection. You got the Guild to back off demands for your death by offering to make amends by working for the criminals, but even so the kingpin still plots a personal revenge.
2 | The Guild took over your family business, ran it into the ground, and burned the building for insurance money. You were driven into crime yourself, but you'll never work for the Guild. You take special joy in hitting its targets first, tipping off its con victims and otherwise frustrating its schemes.
3 | It's always been about money. You're not paid what you're worth, working for someone who has more than they deserve. But the Guild offered you a way to fix that. You keep doing what you've always done—guard work, dock labor, business accounting—but what you learn you pass on to the Guild.
4 | The inequality of Baldur's Gate has driven you to take matters into your own hands. You steal from patriars and rich Lower City residents, funneling the money through charitable fronts to help the needy.
5 | You got into crime as a bored patriar looking for excitement. Your family has no idea of your activities, and neither does the Guild. If either of them ever finds out, your life as you know it will be over.
6 | A close friend or relative joined the Guild and vanished mysteriously. You've worked your way into the lower ranks hoping to find out what happened to them.
7 | You've always wanted to be a member of the Guild. As a child, you looked up to the Guild members' swagger, their flashy dress, and their competence, which all marked them as different from the other adults you knew. As soon as you could, you joined the organization.
8 | To you, this is just a way to earn a living. You go to work, do what needs to be done, and get paid. Anyone who pursues crime for thrill-seeking, to strike back at unjust authorities, or anything else are amateurs, and they're liable to get you arrested or killed with their idiocy.</text>

      <text>Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong.
2 | I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me.
3 | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things could be hidden.
4 | I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.
5 | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.
6 | I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.
7 | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it.
8 | I blow up at the slightest insult.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Honor. I don't steal from others in the trade. (Lawful)
2 | Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic)
3 | Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good)
4 | Greed. I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy. (Evil)
5 | People. I'm loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral)
6 | Redemption. There's a spark of good in everyone. (Good)

d6 | Bond
1 | I'm trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.
2 | My ill-gotten gains go to support my family.
3 | Something important was taken from me, and I aim to steal it back.
4 | I will become the greatest thief that ever lived.
5 | I'm guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it.
6 | Someone I loved died because of a mistake I made. That will never happen again.

d6 | Flaw
1 | When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it.
2 | When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.
3 | If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it.
4 | I have a "tell" that reveals when I'm lying.
5 | I turn tail and run when things look bad.
6 | An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that.</text>

      <text>Folk heroes might rise from a variety of circumstances, or their origins might be a secret as they do their work anonymously. If you wish, you may roll on the Folk Hero Origins table for an event that started you down your heroic path.

Folk Hero Origins:
d6 | Origin
1 | You helped get healing for a sick child. Now the sick come to you, knowing you'll help them find a way to salvation.
2 | You helped break a Guild protection racket afflicting a community of immigrants in the Outer City. Now, you can't travel through that part of the city without your dozen adopted grandparents inviting you in for a meal.
3 | Seeing a lost patriar after dark in the Outer City, you guided the wayward noble through back streets to safety. The patriar repaid your help by paying for improved roofs and lamps in your neighborhood, causing the entire community to celebrate your deed.
4 | Fueled by alcohol, you faced down a carrion crawler that slunk out of the sewer, knocking it out with a single punch. Since then, however, the ale you once credited with your heroism has drowned it, and even your most patient admirers are losing hope. You're hoping for one last chance to win back the goodwill you've drunk away.
5 | You once defeated a raging bugbear with a hand mirror, a mounted deer's head, and two kicks to the groin. Later, you and the bugbear became friends.
6 | Last winter, you dove into the frigid river to haul out a foundering fishing boat with your bare hands, saving all aboard. Now, everyone on the docks knows your name.</text>

      <name>Feature: Guild Membership</name>
      <text>As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.
	Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.
	You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.</text>

      <text>The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.
	You're familiar with the city's crews, their territories, and inter-crew politics. Choose one of the three districts of Baldur's Gate: the Upper City, the Lower City, or the Outer City. This is the district where you conduct most of your business. Whenever you need information about something in one of that district's neighborhoods, you can seek out crew members in that area and learn the local gossip. You can also gain unimpeded entry to nearly any bank, guild hall, place of business, workhouse, or crew meeting place in your district.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Guild Business</name>
      <text>Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade. However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.

Guild Business:
d20 | Guild Business
1 | Alchemists and apothecaries
2 | Armorers, locksmiths, and finesmiths
3 | Brewers, distillers, and vintners
4 | Calligraphers, scribes, and scriveners
5 | Carpenters, roofers, and plasterers
6 | Cartographers, surveyors, and chart-makers
7 | Cobblers and shoemakers
8 | Cooks and bakers
9 | Glassblowers and glaziers
10 | Jewelers and gemcutters
11 | Leatherworkers, skinners, and tanners
12 | Masons and stonecutters
13 | Painters, limners, and sign-makers

16 | Smiths and metal-forgers
17 | Tinkers, pewterers, and casters
18 | Wagon-makers and wheelwrights
19 | Weavers and dyers
20 | Woodcarvers, coopers, and bowyers

As a member of your guild, you know the skills needed to create finished items from raw materials (reflected in your proficiency with a certain kind of artisan's tools), as well as the principles of trade and good business practices. The question now is whether you abandon your trade for adventure, or take on the extra effort to weave adventuring and trade together.</text>

      <name>Feature: Discovery</name>
      <text>The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.

	You know the Baldur's Gate most Baldurians ignore, the dog-eat-dog world of the homeless and unfortunate. You know where to go in the Lower City and Outer City for anonymity. In these slums and alley camps, you can get a damp bed and a bad meal, but also a degree of privacy and no questions asked. Living here isn't comfortable, but it's unlikely anyone will find you—and you can stay as long as you want.</text>

Hermit Origins:
d6 | Origin
1 | You led an ill-fated expedition into the Riverveins. Your friends were swept away by flooding, and you've never been able to shake the guilt of causing their deaths over a frivolous lark. You've maintained a solitary vigil outside the cavern entrance ever since.
2 | You crossed the Guild in a bad way. Fortunately, its members think you're dead. Less fortunately, maintaining that deception might require you to stay in hiding until you actually are.
3 | You study the puzzles of mortal natures. You've seen followers of evil deities perform miracles for the helpless at Twin Songs, and you've seen patriars who worship good deities turn their backs on the poor daily. Bearing witness to such things, and meditating on their contradictions, fills your hours.
4 | You tend to some part of the city's forgotten history: the unmarked graves in Cliffside Cemetery, the crumbling remains of dead patriar families' manors, or a collection of religious texts stuffed into an attic and forgotten when a believer's patron deity died. In this solitary work, you've learned secrets no one else knows.
5 | You killed a patriar's scion in an illegal duel. The family swore revenge, and you fled to the slums rather than risk bringing their wrath down on your kin.
6 | You aren't originally from Baldur's Gate. You came here seeking something else, only to learn that the quest that drove you had become impossible to fulfill—its object was destroyed or its purpose was negated by some superseding event. Suddenly directionless and unable to return to your homeland, you have lingered, adrift, in this wretched city.</text>

Life of Seclusion:

4 | I retreated from society after a life-altering event.
5 | I needed a quiet place to work on my art, literature, music, or manifesto.

1 | I've been isolated for so long that I rarely speak, preferring gestures and the occasional grunt.
2 | I am utterly serene, even in the face of disaster.
3 | The leader of my community had something wise to say on every topic, and I am eager to share that wisdom.
4 | I feel tremendous empathy for all who suffer.
5 | I'm oblivious to etiquette and social expectations.
6 | I connect everything that happens to me to a grand, cosmic plan.
7 | I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, becoming oblivious to my surroundings.
8 | I am working on a grand philosophical theory and love sharing my ideas.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Greater Good. My gifts are meant to be shared with all, not used for my own benefit. (Good)
2 | Logic. Emotions must not cloud our sense of what is right and true, or our logical thinking. (Lawful)
3 | Free Thinking. Inquiry and curiosity are the pillars of progress. (Chaotic)
4 | Power. Solitude and contemplation are paths toward mystical or magical power. (Evil)
5 | Live and Let Live. Meddling in the affairs of others only causes trouble. (Neutral)
6 | Self-Knowledge. If you know yourself, there's nothing left to know. (Any)

d6 | Bond
1 | Nothing is more important than the other members of my hermitage, order, or association.
2 | I entered seclusion to hide from the ones who might still be hunting me. I must someday confront them.
3 | I'm still seeking the enlightenment I pursued in my seclusion, and it still eludes me.
4 | I entered seclusion because I loved someone I could not have.
5 | Should my discovery come to light, it could bring ruin to the world.
6 | My isolation gave me great insight into a great evil that only I can destroy.

d6 | Flaw
1 | Now that I've returned to the world, I enjoy its delights a little too much.
2 | I harbor dark, bloodthirsty thoughts that my isolation and meditation failed to quell.
3 | I am dogmatic in my thoughts and philosophy.
4 | I let my need to win arguments overshadow friendships and harmony.
5 | I'd risk too much to uncover a lost bit of knowledge.

    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The patriars of Baldur's Gate live in the Upper City. where they host grand galas and flaunt cosmopolitan fashions, but are walled off from the poverty and squalor of the less fortunate districts and their neighborhoods. Although they might visit prosperous Bloomridge to try a fashionable restaurant or boutique, or watch a spectacle at the Oasis Theater, the patriars have little reason to venture into the dirtier, more dangerous parts of the city. If they do, it is generally as thrill-seeking tourists or enclosed by a retinue of armed guards, not as friends or neighbors. As a result, many patriars are at once acutely attuned to the nuances of royal courts half a continent away and shockingly ignorant of what life is like for the poor outside their own doorsteps.
	This combination of worldly savvy and local blindness characterizes almost all the nobility of Baldur's Gate. As a result, for those who wish to play patriars, the Patriar feature below replaces the Position and Privilege feature of the noble background. Those who wish to use the background's standard feature might have gained their standing in Baldur's Gate from business rather than inheritance.

You are welcome in the Upper City and may stay there after dark without being harassed or evicted. Your word is accepted over others' without question, and any corruption among guards or government officials tends to work in your favor, not against you—at least until you make some effort to expose it.</text>

      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

Outlander Origins:
d6 | Origin
1 | Someone stole something precious from your people. You tracked the thief to the city gates, but finding clues in an urban environment is very different from tracking someone across the wilderness. You don't know where to go from here, but your people need you to succeed.
2 | You've always been fascinated by the glitter and glamor of city life, so different from the slow pace of life in your homeland. Now you're here, ready to make your mark in the world, but unsure how to begin.
3 | War, plague, famine, or a marauding monster ravaged your home, forcing you to flee for your life. You don't even know how many of your people survived or where to find them. Alone or accompanied by a handful of equally bereft survivors, you must navigate a new life that you never asked for.
4 | You were captured by kidnappers and taken far from your home. The Knights of the Unicorn freed you and brought you here, but now you're on your own.
5 | You were exiled for breaking a trivial-seeming taboo. For this seemingly minor transgression, you lost your friends, family, and homeland in one fell swoop, and were given little choice but to strike out on your own.
6 | A peddler once brought something astonishing to your homeland—a Gondan clockwork, shimmering cloth of gold, a trained speaking bird, or some other small wonder—and told you that it came from Baldur's Gate. You've come to see the source of such wonders, and perhaps learn to create them.</text>

      <text>Often considered rude and uncouth among civilized folk, outlanders have little respect for the niceties of life in the cities. The ties of tribe, clan, family, and the natural world of which they are a part are the most important bonds to most outlanders.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.
2 | I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups.
3 | I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn to my clan of an approaching orc horde. I'd do it again if I had to.
4 | I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature.
5 | I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won't save you from a hungry owlbear.
6 | I'm always picking things up, absently fiddling with them, and sometimes accidentally breaking them.
7 | I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.
8 | I was, in fact, raised by wolves.

d6 | Bond
1 | My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me.
2 | An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me.
3 | I will bring terrible wrath down on the evildoers who destroyed my homeland.
4 | I am the last of my tribe, and it is up to me to ensure their names enter legend.
5 | I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.
6 | It is my duty to provide children to sustain my tribe.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants.
2 | There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.
3 | I remember every insult I've received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who's ever wronged me.
4 | I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies.
5 | Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.
6 | Don't expect me to save those who can't save themselves. It is nature's way that the strong thrive and the weak perish.</text>

The city is also rife with opportunities for arcane study, although its masters are dispersed across individual wizards' abodes and lack concentrated communities.

      <text>Baldur's Gate was founded by sailors, and its harbor is still the city's beating heart. Several patriars are descended from captains of yore, the commerce of the Lower City is built on the port, and even the Outer City's rhythms are dominated by the ebb and flow of river trade. Because sailors are as fundamental and ubiquitous to Baldur's Gate as the cobbles on its streets, characters with this background are common.

      <text>Most of your fellow adventurers and the world know you as your persona.

Upon donning a disguise and behaving as your persona, you are unidentifiable as your true self. By removing your disguise and revealing your true face, you are no longer identifiable as your persona. This allows you to change appearances between your two personalities as often as you wish, using one to hide the other or serve as convenient camouflage.

      <text>A faceless character usually plays their persona—the hero or extraordinary person they are every day. That's all a facade, though, or a part of them expressed to an extreme. To define a persona, feel free to choose characteristics from other backgrounds, particularly folk hero, hermit, or noble. For the person behind the persona, the one who truly strives to be faceless, consider a distinct set of faceless characteristics. As a result, those with this background have two sets of characteristics, one for their persona, and one for their faceless selves.

2 | You're told you went missing for weeks. When you were found, you had no memory of being gone. Now you search to discover what happened to you.
3 | You helped a spirit find peace by finding its missing corpse. Ever since, other spectral clients have sought you out to help them find rest.
4 | You revealed that the monsters terrorizing your home were illusions created by a cruel mage. The magic-user escaped, but you've continued to uncover magical hoaxes.
5 | You were wrongfully accused and convicted of a crime. You managed to escape and seek to help others avoid the experience you suffered, even while still being pursued by the law.
6 | You survived the destructive use of a magic device that wiped out your home. Members of a secret organization found you. You now work with them, tracking down dangerous supernatural phenomena and preventing them from doing harm.
7 | You found evidence of a conspiracy underpinning society. You tried to expose this mysterious cabal, but no one believed you. You're still trying to prove what you know is true.
8 | You got a job with an agency that investigates crimes that local law enforcement can't solve. You often wonder which you value more, the truth or your pay.</text>

Through a combination of fast-talking, determination, and official-looking documentation, you can gain access to a place or an individual related to a crime you're investigating. Those who aren't involved in your investigation avoid impeding you or pass along your requests. Additionally, local law enforcement has firm opinions about you, viewing you as either a nuisance or one of their own.</text>

      <name>Horror Trinkets</name>
      <text>Sinister deeds and festering evils take many forms, sometimes as stories and sometimes as physical scars. All manner of talismans, mementos, criminal evidence, mysterious devices, cursed relics, and physical impossibilities might embody just such scars - summaries of terrors in material form.
	Before you finish making a character, roll once on the Horror Trinkets table for a unique object your character has with them at the start of their adventuring career. These trinkets hint toward various horrific tales and might lead to dreadful revelations or be nothing more than grim keepsakes. At the DM's discretion any of these trinkets might also be a Mist talisman (detailed in chapter 3), a focal item that can lead the bearer through the Mists to a particular Domain of Dread.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You grew up in the Feywild after disappearing from your home plane as a child. Perhaps you were spirited away by kindly Fey who thought you were destined for great things. Perhaps you stumbled through a fey crossing by chance during a twilight stroll in the woods. Perhaps you were kidnapped by evil Fey but escaped from their clutches. Whatever the manner of your disappearance, you gradually fell under the Feywild's spell and learned a little about the nature of the mercurial tricksters that dwell there.
	When you finally returned to your home plane, you did not come back unchanged. You are haunted by the fact that the Feywild—a mirror world hidden behind a mere twist of perception—is only a hair's breadth away. Although your memories of the Feywild grow fainter with each passing day, your heart swells with a mixture of fear and joy at the prospect of one day venturing back to the Plane of Faerie—your home away from home.

As a hand, you work hard and party hard. The carnival has borne you to many fantastic worlds, circling back around to your home world once every eight years, but you know almost nothing about these worlds because you spend all your time in the carnival. You know the other hands well, but the carnival's owners—Mister Witch and Mister Light—remain mysterious to you even after all these years.
	Maybe you joined the carnival to escape a dismal life at home, or maybe you were enchanted by the idea of visiting new places or the dream of becoming one of the carnival's star attractions. Now that you're older, carnival life has lost some of its appeal. The daily routine has grown tedious, the cyclical nature of the carnival's journey monotonous. The carnival no longer fills your heart with a sense of wonder. Perhaps greater adventures await you beyond the carnival's gates.

d6 | Personality Trait
1 | I thrive on esoteric lore. The more obscure the historical references I can include in everyday conversation, the better.
2 | By searching for these lost artifacts, I hope to find who I really am along the way.
3 | I can barely go a minute without talking about my research. I have so much knowledge in my head, and it needs to be let out somewhere!
4 | The spirits of the dead are so much more interesting to talk with than living classmates.
5 | I can speak eloquently about the historical ramifications of an ancient war. But ask me to add two-digit numbers together, and I'm a mess.
6 | In the end, it's all just entropy. Everything falls apart someday.</text>

3rd | Haste, Water Walk
4th | Freedom of Movement, Wall of Fire
5th | Cone of Cold, Conjure Elemental

Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. You might wield your Prismari spells with dynamic, gestural movement—as much dance as somatic component. Even a blast of fire in your hands is a sculpted work of art; elemental forces make grand designs as you hurl spells. These forces might linger on your body or in your clothes as decorative elements after your spells are dissipated, as sparks dance in your hair and your touch leaves tracings of frost on whatever you touch.</text>

Clerics aren't very common in this school, but some with the Tempest domain end up here.
	Beyond the ranks of traditional spellcasters, Prismari students also include monks who follow the Way of the Four Elements. Some acrobatic rogues and fighters (including those who emulate the archetype of the Eldritch Knight) also delight in the athleticism of Prismari performance.</text>

      <text>Though you aren't a Giant, you grew up among giants. Maybe you were an orphan taken in by a sympathetic family of stone giants who raised you as one of their own. Or perhaps you lived in a lost prehistoric pocket of the world, surrounded by giants and fearsome behemoths or hulking dinosaurs.
	Something about your environment — perhaps the food or water that sustained you, elemental magic inherent in the site of your home, or some verdant blessing of growth placed on you — caused you to grow to a remarkable size for your kind. With the aid of this magic, you have learned how to embody the might of giants. You are used to moving through a world much bigger than you, and that is reflected in your skills, attitude, and perspective on life.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Survival
	• Languages: Giant and one other language of your choice
	• Equipment: A backpack, a set of traveler's clothes, a small stone or sprig that reminds you of home, and a pouch containing 10 gp

Foundling Origin:
d6 | Origin
1 | You were found as a baby by a family of nomadic giants who raised you as one of their own.
2 | A family of stone giants rescued you when you fell into a mountain chasm, and you have lived with them underground ever since.
3 | You were lost or abandoned as a child in a jungle that teemed with ravenous dinosaurs. There, you found an equally lost frost giant; together, you survived.
4 | Your farm was crushed and your family killed in a battle between warring groups of giants. Racked with guilt over the destruction, a sympathetic giant soldier promised to care for you.
5 | After you had a series of strange dreams as a child, your superstitious parents sent you to study with a powerful but aloof storm giant oracle.
6 | While playing hide-and-seek with your friends, you stumbled into the castle of a cloud giant, who immediately adopted you.</text>

4 | I embrace my shorter stature. It helps me stay unnoticed—and underestimated.
5 | Every avalanche begins as a single pebble.

3 | The old, traditional markings of runecraft look so boring. Why not give my runes some flair?
4 | In my studies of runes, I strive to understand how great civilizations of the past fell, so I can prevent it from happening to societies of the present.
5 | Life may be a whirlwind of chaos, but whenever I create my runes, I feel at peace.

	The primary factions of Sigil adhere to the following philosophies:

	• Athar: Deities are frauds and merely channel the might of a true, higher power.

	• Bleak Cabal: There is no greater truth to the multiverse. Each being must discover their own meaning.

	• Doomguard: Nothing lasts forever. The purpose of everything is to crumble and decay.

	• Fated: Everyone makes their own fate and is entitled to whatever they can take and hold.

	• Fraternity of Order: All of existence is governed by laws, and power comes from understanding and exploiting them.

	• Hands of Havoc: Those who try to impose a single order on the multiverse are doomed to fail.

	• Harmonium: The multiverse will be perfect only when everything is acting in harmony, whether it wants to or not.

	• Heralds of Dust: Everyone is already dead; the entirety of the multiverse is an afterlife. Undeath holds the key to the next stage of existence.

	• Mercykillers: Cold, relentless justice is absolute, and no one is above it.

	• Mind's Eye: The multiverse exists to be explored. It shapes us, and we shape it in turn.

	• Society of Sensation: Sensation is the proof of existence. By experiencing everything, we can understand the multiverse in all its complexity.

	• Transcendent Order: Thought clouds action. To fall in step with the multiverse, one must act on instinct alone.</text>

      <text>Rewarded characters have varied histories, but they have one thing in common: they were down on their luck before their lives abruptly turned around. They might have given up all hope of a happier life, only to suddenly get a second chance. A rewarded character has often spent many years struggling to escape painful circumstances. Now, extricated from the (sometimes literal) prison that was their former life, they throw their cares to the wind and become adventurers.
	If your character's life was changed by a Deck of Many Things, consider which card was responsible. Perhaps the Fates card undid a tragic mistake your character made in their youth. The Gem card could have wiped out debts incurred over a lifetime. Maybe the Sage card provided the advice needed to escape a hopeless situation, the Star card increased an ability score to its current value, or a Wish spell cast after drawing the Moon card transformed your character from a peddler to a fledgling sorcerer infused with magic and new knowledge and skills. If you're making a character at higher than 1st level, magic items they have could have been granted by the Key or Sun card.</text>

Rogue | A devout individual whom you looked up to revealed themself to be false, a disciple of a power opposed to your beliefs.
Ruin | You were once a favored adherent of a religious order, but you've been cast out in disgrace.
Sage | An otherworldly being whispers advice to you in dreams or visitations, taking on different guises and speaking through others.
Skull | You were returned to life through resurrection magic, divine intervention, or a mysterious circumstance you don't yet understand.
Star | When you adopted your current beliefs, your life changed dramatically for the better.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Little is known about the Augen Trust, even within the court of the Dwendalian Empire. Only one person knows all the members of this elite network of imperial spies: its leader, Oliver Schreiber, a noble gnome with the ear of King Dwendal.
	If you were favored with membership in the Augen Trust, your entire life was laid bare before the secret spymaster at one point, and you were found to be a loyal servant of the empire with a particular set of skills. Betraying the Trust is high treason against the crown, and defectors are hunted down and quickly slain.
	Most defectors from the Augen Trust flee to the Biting North, beyond the reach of the empire. The Clovis Concord would extradite traitors in a heartbeat to maintain diplomatic relations with the empire, and fleeing to Xhorhas is tantamount to suicide in the present political climate.
	If you are a member of the Trust going on adventures, you are either a traitor who has somehow managed to keep your true identity secret from the greatest spies in the empire - or you are still on active duty. In the latter case, you can work with your DM to figure out why you are traveling with outside adventurers.

	As a rank-and-file pupil of the Cobalt Soul, you adventure to help expand your mind. Alternatively (and with the DM's permission), you might also take on a more specific role within the organization. Expositors are secret agents who gather information in the field, while archivists are the curators who ensure the well-being of the Cobalt Soul's many Archives. Monks of the Cobalt Soul are enlightened scholars who lead expeditions into ancient and forgotten places, hoping to reclaim their lost knowledge and history.

      <text>The Golden Grin began in the far-off land of Tal'Dorei, trading secret messages through a network of bards and minstrels to undermine an iron-fisted king's authoritarian rule. Today, Tal'Dorei is a relatively peaceful republic, and some Grinners have grown restless while waiting for tyranny to raise its ugly head again. A contingent of such Grinners traveled to the Menagerie Coast and set up a network of secret bases in the cities of the Clovis Concord, from which they are presently working their way into the highest echelons of the Dwendalian Empire.
	You are a Grinner. Your goals are to spread freedom and inspire hope—or, in time, revolution—in the hearts of the oppressed.

Code-Songs:

1 | Zan's Comin' Back. This hopeful Tal'Dorei folk song declares the inevitable return of a just ruler. Use it to seek out potential allies.
2 | Blow Fire Down the Coast. A rowdy fighting song from the Clovis Concord, this ditty talks of blasting up pirate ships. Use it to encourage battle.
3 | Hush! Onward Come the Dragons. This Tal'Dorei folk song recounts the terror in the days after the invasion of the red dragon called the Cinder King. Use it to encourage caution in speech and deed.
4 | Let the Sword Grow Rust. An antiwar anthem from Marquet, this song has uncertain origins. Use it to help quell violent encounters.
5 | Drink Deep, Li'l Hummingbird. A drinking rondo from the Menagerie Coast, this song tells the tale of a young person who drinks so heavily that they awaken to find they've stowed away on a ship. Use it to encourage alertness in social situations.
6 | Dirge for the Emerald Fire. This elven song supposedly has thousands of obscure verses. Use the first two verses to spread news of death or defeat.</text>

      <name>Feature: Ballad of the Grinning Fool</name>
      <text>Like every Grinner, you know how to find a hideout. In any city of 10,000 people or more on the Menagerie Coast or in the lands of the Dwendalian Empire, you can play the "Ballad of the Grinning Fool" in a major tavern or inn. A member of the Golden Grin will find you and give shelter to you and any companions you vouch for. This shelter might be discontinued if it becomes too dangerous to hide you, at the DM's discretion.
	This feature must be used with caution, for not all who know the ballad are your friends. Some are traitors, counterspies, or agents of tyranny.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Grinners are trained in the art of secrecy and innuendo, and are skilled at hiding in plain sight by being the loudest and brightest person in the room. Their skills in subterfuge and combat lend themselves well to an adventuring lifestyle, and traveling with mercenaries and treasure hunters creates a convenient excuse to journey through lands bent under tyranny.

8 | I'm lucky like you wouldn't believe.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Revolution. Tyrants must fall, no matter the cost. (Chaotic)
2 | Compassion. The only way to make a better world is to perform small kindnesses. (Good)
3 | Justice. A nation built upon just foundations will uphold freedom for all. (Law)
4 | Expression. Music, joy, and laughter are the keys to freedom. (Good)
5 | Self-Determination. People should be free to do as they please. (Chaotic)
6 | Vigilance. A free people must be carefully taught, lest they be misled. (Neutral)

d6 | Bond
1 | I lost someone important to an agent of the Dwendalian Empire. That regime will fall.
2 | The first people to be hurt by this war will be the common folk. I need to protect them.
3 | Music helped me through a dark time in my life. Now, I'll use music to change the world.
4 | I will be known as the greatest spy who ever lived.
5 | All life is precious to me. I know I can change the world without taking a humanoid life.
6 | The elite in their ivory towers don't understand how we suffer. I intend to show them.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I've never lied once in my life. What? No, I'm not crossing my fingers!
2 | I do everything big! Subtlety? I don't know the meaning of subtlety! Oh, that's a problem?
3 | Being a spy in wartime is painful. I've seen so much suffering, I think I'm losing my mind.
4 | I can't focus on my mission. I just want to carouse and sing and play!
5 | Yeah, that's my name. Yeah, I'm a Grinner spy. Who cares about staying undercover?
6 | I can't afford to trust anyone. Not. Anyone.</text>

You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.
	You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home.

    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities.

Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example.

5 | I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation.
6 | I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods.
7 | I've enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple's elite. Rough living grates on me.
8 | I've spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world.

d6 | Bond
1 | I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago.

4 | Everything I do is for the common people.
5 | I will do anything to protect the temple where I served.
6 | I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies consider heretical and seek to destroy.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely.
2 | I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy.
3 | My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god.
4 | I am inflexible in my thinking.
5 | I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.

You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.</text>

      <name>Variant Feature: Bad Reputation</name>
      <text>If your character has a sailor background, you may select this background feature instead of Ship's Passage.
	No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are in a civilized settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.</text>

      <text>Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.

      <text>The Volstrucker are a clandestine organization of arcane assassins and enforcers in the service of the Cerberus Assembly. Their operatives bear no official title, but are referred to in hushed tones as "scourgers" by residents of large Dwendalian cities such as Zadash and Rexxentrum.
	You are a Volstrucker agent. Your duty is to silence dissidents who would undermine the will of King Dwendal — and more importantly, the will of the Assembly.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Stealth

      <name>Tragedy</name>
      <text>Happy people aren't selected to join the Volstrucker. The Cerberus Assembly preys upon talented individuals who have been broken by tragedy — in some cases, tragedy that the Volstrucker has arranged for. A slightly broken mind is more easily reshaped and reeducated. Choose the tragedy that set you on this path, or roll on the Tragedies table.

Tragedies:
d6 | Tragedy
1 | Familicide. Through deceit or manipulation, the Volstrucker convinced you to slaughter your own family.
2 | Amnesia. You were forced to study magic so potent that it strained your mind beyond mortal limits, stealing away the memories of your past.
3 | Capture. You were captured and tortured by agents of the Kryn Dynasty, and barely escaped.
4 | Starvation. A terrible blight afflicted your rural village, and many of your friends and family members starved to death. You survived, but only barely.
5 | Disfigurement. One of your arcane experiments went wrong and scarred or dismembered you so gravely that others now shun you. Only the Volstrucker showed you kindness after that day.
6 | Vicissitude. You were once the scion of a wealthy family who lost their entire fortune in the blink of an eye.</text>

If you write a letter in a special arcane ink, address it to a member of the Volstrucker, and cast it into a fire, the letter will burn to cinders and materialize whole again on the person of the agent you addressed it to.
	The ink used to send a letter across the shadow network is the same as that used by a wizard to scribe spells in a spellbook. Writing a letter in this ink costs 10 gp per page.</text>

Officially, no one ever leaves the order — but those desperate enough do whatever it takes to gain some measure of freedom.

    <proficiency>Nature</proficiency>
    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Isolated from the political struggles of urban Tal'Dorei, you are a member of the Ashari people—a society bound to an ancient covenant protecting the Material Plane from the chaos of the primordial elements. You've been raised to revere and protect the natural world, and to shepherd the tumultuous elemental forces that give it life. When the elements threaten to overwhelm the delicate balance of nature, it is the role of the Ashari to restore harmony.
	You grew up in a tight-knit society, bound to a leader who successfully returned from the traditional journey to the Elemental Planes known as an Aramante. By contrast, you might well have never traveled more than a few days from your home, and thus have closer bonds with your family and neighbors than many people of Tal'Dorei.
	In your early life, you likely took up one of the many roles that make up your society, whether homemaker, hunter, explorer, or protector. If you have the ability to use elemental magic, you might have had one of the most important duties of all: protecting and soothing the elemental rift at the heart of your home. And even as an adventurer now traveling far beyond that home, your loyalties still lie with the continued safety of your order. Whatever else you do as you learn about the new world around you, you're conscious of the need to gather allies to your cause.
	Each Ashari is tethered to one of the four elemental orders and their settlements. You must select Pyrah (fire), Vesrah (water), Terrah (earth), or Zephrah (wind). The rifts of earth and air are both in Tal'Dorei. If you live or lived among your people, then you are familiar with the remarkable sights of Air Ashari on skysails above the Summit Peaks, or Earth Ashari erupting from the solid stone of the Cliffkeep Mountains on their earthboards (see page 198 for these magic items' game statistics).

	• Skill Proficiencies: Nature, plus your choice of Arcana or Survival
	• Tool Proficiencies: Herbalism kit
	• Languages: Primordial (Aquan, Auran, Ignan, or Terran, depending on the elemental affinity of your tribe)
	• Equipment: A set of traveler's clothes, a staff carved with symbols of your tribe, an herbalism kit, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp

      <text>Growing up surrounded by wild elemental magics has attuned your senses to those chaotic forces, enabling you to subtly bend them to your will. As an action, you channel minor magic involving the element of your chosen Ashari order, giving you one of the following abilities:

Pyrah. You instantaneously create and control a burst of flame small enough to light a candle, a torch, or a small campfire. Alternatively, you snuff out a flame of the same size.

Terrah. You instantaneously create a small rock no larger than a gold coin. The rock appears in your hand, then turns to dust after 1 minute.

Vesrah. You instantaneously create enough hot or cold water to fill a small drinking vessel.

Zephrah. You create an instantaneous puff of wind strong enough to blow papers off a desk or mess up someone's hair.</text>

      <text>The Ashari hold themselves removed from the rest of Tal'Dorei by their own choice. This makes many Ashari naive to the ways of the world beyond their homes—but it can also make them determined, steadfast, and tightly focused on their goals. Ever since Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest and leader of the Zephrah, became a world-renowned hero, the Air Ashari at least have become more familiar to Tal'Dorei's other peoples. They are known to welcome outsiders to their mountaintop enclave, and to take on quests that force them to leave their isolated home.
	To learn more about your character's Ashari order, see "The Ashari" on page 48.

1 | I like to keep my hands busy, no matter where I am.

3 | I meditate at dawn each day—and I can't stand it when my routine is interrupted.
4 | I like noticing patterns in the world around me, whether or not they mean anything.
5 | I don't let anything—or anyone—stand in the way of my mission.
6 | I'm a plain talker, even with people who outrank me.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Whether you grew up in the mean streets of Kymal bamboozling foolish gamblers, or spent your youth pilfering loose coin from the pockets of Emon's many tourists, your lifestyle of deceiving-to-survive eventually drew the attention of the Clasp: a storied crime syndicate that has hideouts in every city in Tal'Dorei. In exchange for protection, a modicum of kinship, and a number of useful resources to further develop your craft as a criminal, you agreed to receive the brand of the Clasp and join their ranks.
	You might have spent time working the guild's most menial assignments, wandering the alleys as a simple cutpurse and filling your pockets with silver while you waited to climb the professional ladder. Or you might be a clever actor and liar, whose skill at blending in with all facets of society has made you an indispensable spy. Perhaps your swift technique with a blade led you to become a feared assassin for the Spireling leader of a local Clasp sect. Regardless, though the threat of the law is ever looming, the advantages to having a connection to such a powerful cartel greatly outweighs your paranoia. Most of the time.
	Since the Clasp is an organization, its members can rise in rank by proving their worth, by making the right friends in high places, or even through blackmail and bribery. You and the Game Master can decide together how your actions affect your rank in the Clasp, and what benefits that rank grants you.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Deception, plus your choice of Sleight of Hand or Stealth
	• Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, forgery kit, or thieves' tools (one of your choice)
	• Languages: Thieves' Cant

    <trait>
      <name>Feature: A Favor in Turn</name>
      <text>You have gained enough clout in the Clasp that you can call in a favor from your contacts whenever you're close enough to a center of syndicate activity. A request for a favor can be no longer than 20 words, and is passed up the chain to an undisclosed Spireling for approval. This favor can take on any form subject to the approval of the GM, who decides how it is fulfilled. If muscle is requested, an NPC member of the Clasp (using statistics found in chapter 6) can temporarily aid your party. If money is needed, a small loan can be provided. If you've been imprisoned, Clasp operatives can look into breaking you out or paying off the jailer.
	At some point, the favor will be called in for repayment, often without warning. Refusing the call will result in your termination—literally. You might be called on to commit a specific burglary, or to pressure an Emonian dignitary to reveal a secret at an upcoming ball. The Clasp might even demand that you assassinate a specific person, with no questions asked or answered. It's the GM's prerogative to ensure that the syndicate's request is proportionate to the favor they bestowed—or that they compensate you in other ways for a service that goes beyond the scope of repaying the initial favor.</text>

      <name>Variant Feature: Myriad Operative</name>
      <text>Your skill set might be similar to that of many members of the Clasp, but you work for a criminal organization that is far more sophisticated—and even less scrupulous. As a Myriad operative in Tal'Dorei, you might have been given a specific task that furthers that syndicate's hunger to expand beyond Wildemount, or which gives them an edge in their rivalry with the Clasp. Moreover, you understand the wisdom of keeping your activities secret from fellow criminals as well as law enforcement, since the agents of the Clasp will show you no mercy if your true identity is ever revealed.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>The Clasp enjoys a strange status in Tal'Dorei. The syndicate is a feared group of thieves and killers, whose name is often invoked only in whispers. But at the same time, the organization has a reputation for guerilla heroism, in response to its members having saved countless lives when the Chroma Conclave attacked Emon. And so like every Clasp member, your own reputation often swings between these two poles.
	Your bond is likely associated with your fellow Clasp members or the individual who introduced you to the syndicate. Your ideal probably involves establishing your importance and indispensability to the Clasp.

(Or at least you pretended to. Even at the Lyceum, every class has its slackers.) Eventually, though, the call to adventure pulled you from your studies, and you now face the challenge of keeping up with your education even as the tides of destiny threaten to sweep you away.
	You might have come to the Lyceum to better research and understand the history and lore of Exandria and the lands you call home. Perhaps you sought a future here as a professor—or you might hope to do so still. You could also have been drawn by the promise of prosperity in politics, learning the inner workings of government and alliances to better position yourself as a future writer of history. Or perhaps your knack for the arcane inspired you to attend the Lyceum to refine your spellcraft, following in the footsteps of some of the finest wizards to ever practice the arts of magic.

2 | You think you're so great just because you've got muscles, and endurance, and…shut up! Read a book sometime!
3 | Huh? What? Sorry, I was thinking about a test I need to retake when I get back to school...
4 | I spent too much time studying. Now I don't have any friends.
5 | If you don't match my aesthetic, I'm not interested in you. We can work together, but we won't be friends. Got it?
6 | I'm always striving for perfection. I got top of my class, sure, but only with a 98 average. And that's. Not. Perfect.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Two pantheons have battled over the fate of Exandria since the world's founding—the Prime Deities and the Betrayer Gods. During the Calamity, the Prime Deities allied themselves with the mortal races of Exandria, their original creations, to protect their flawed world and its multifarious forms of life. The Betrayers sought to wipe the slate clean.
	At the end of that devastating war, the Prime Deities established a Divine Gate that would prevent all gods, good or evil, from directly affecting the world, but which would leave the gods' mortal followers and supernal servants to enact their will. And so the corrupting whispers of the Betrayer Gods have ensnared the minds of power-hungry mortals for centuries, promising them a sliver of the gods' great power in exchange for dedicating their souls to occult lore.
	You once belonged to such a cult of the Betrayer Gods. Perhaps this faith only briefly tempted your rebellious, youthful spirit. Perhaps the cult gave you love and family when you had none, asking only your adherence to their prophet in exchange. Or maybe you were raised from birth to pay homage to gods of selfish cruelty—until one fateful day the veil was lifted, so that nothing stood between you and the horrifying truth.
	However it happened, you were freed from the shackles of this poisonous sect. Yet you know that this group does not forgive betrayers. As long as you live, you will be hunted—and if the members of the cult think you dead, their hunt will begin again the second they learn they're wrong.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Deception and Religion
	• Languages: One of your choice
	• Equipment: Vestments and a holy symbol of your previous cult, a set of common clothes, a belt pouch containing 15 gp

      <text>You were inundated with knowledge about one of the Betrayer Gods, and know by heart everything from their basic commandments to some of their most esoteric secrets. Choose one of the Betrayer Gods described in chapter 2. You have advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks to know information about their faith, including obscure secrets unknown to most worshipers.
	Additionally, you can work with your GM to create a secret that you learned during your time in the cult. This secret might be the seed of a conspiracy, a myth of a legendary hero whose true meaning has mutated over the years, or even the location of a fabled artifact of the gods.</text>

      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>The life of every former cultist is defined to some degree by the process of fleeing the past, and of trying to make a future away from the beliefs that once claimed them. Your bond is likely associated with those who gave you the insight and strength to flee your old ways. Your ideal might involve your desire to take down and destroy those who promote the evil you escaped, and perhaps finding new faith in a forgiving god.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I need a dagger close at hand at all times. Just in case they find me.
2 | I can't believe I'm out here fighting monsters. After everything I've been through, why can't I find a normal life?
3 | I need a stiff drink before I do anything stressful these days. I know it's a problem. Just…let me have this.
4 | Murder is okay when it's for a good cause! I didn't tear my past out by the roots so I could let evil people cause more harm.
5 | My past is filled with stories like you wouldn't believe. Ones that'll really make your skin crawl. Do you want to hear…?
6 | Yeah, I'm crying. I do that. Get over yourself.
7 | I know you've told me your name twice already, but that's not good enough. How can I be sure you are who you say you are?
8 | My mind is always racing. I can't…I just need to…you have to give me a second—or else I can't…organize my thoughts.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Life. I've spent too long shackled to an evil master. No matter what happened before, I deserve my freedom now. (Chaotic)
2 | Redemption. People can change, but redemption must be something they choose for themselves. If they do, it is my duty to help them along that path. (Good)
3 | Power. When I abandoned the cult, it wasn't out of some misguided sense of righteousness. That pathetic organization was merely a shackle on my potential. (Evil)
4 | Vengeance. The cult has poisoned my life. I will see all its followers suffer. (Any)
5 | Hierarchy. The cult was vile, but its strength was in stability and organization. As long as good folk lack unity, evil will always triumph. (Lawful)
6 | Reparations. As a cultist, I harmed people whose names I'll never know. I feel obligated to repay my debt by aiding others. (Good)

d6 | Bond
1 | My cousin escaped the cult with me. I lost track of them when we fled, but I know they're alive. I can feel it.
2 | I was saved from the cult by a priest of one of the Prime Deities. If not for that sign of faith, I would surely be lost.
3 | I was told by the person who saved me that a sage once said: "Life needs things to live." I don't know what that means, but I've dedicated my existence to finding out.
4 | One of my cultist parents had a change of heart when I was a teenager, and we fled together in the dark of night. I didn't want to leave, but I understand now that their courage saved my life.
5 | I was bested by a warrior when I fumbled a cult-ordered assassination. I don't know why that person took pity on me, but they gave me purpose when I was lost.
6 | Now that I've saved myself, the only person important to me is my former cult leader—because I've sworn that they'll die by my hand.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I'm haunted by what I saw in those ritual chambers. Every time I see blood, I…oh, gods, I can't bear to even think about it.
2 | I ran from the cult long ago. But deep down, there's a part of me that still thinks they were right about certain things.
3 | I can't help but feel a rush whenever I see a life snuffed out before me. Just one more kill… just one more.
4 | Organized religion terrifies me. Betrayer Gods or Prime Deities…it doesn't matter. The sight of the faithful freezes my blood cold.
5 | Oh, I always tell the truth. Always. I've never had to keep a secret from anyone, so of course I'll be open with you.
6 | I don't trust easily. If you grew up being lied to about every little thing? The fundamental nature of the world? You wouldn't, either.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You trained with the elite forces charged with the defense and protection of the isolated city-state of Whitestone, with much of that training focused on how to care for, protect, and safeguard the firearms that are the weapons of the Whitestone Rifle Corps. You are also entrusted with a solemn duty—to never let the secrets of your liege-lord's deadly creations fall into the wrong hands.
	You might have come to Whitestone to prove yourself worthy of wielding the secretive and highly coveted firearms created there, and to seek instruction from warriors who have mastered those weapons. Or you might have grown up in Whitestone, perhaps even remembering the brutal days when Lord and Lady Briarwood ruled your homeland—a reign that began some thirty years ago and lasted for six harrowing years.
	Alternatively, you or your parents might have come to Whitestone as refugees fleeing the destruction of the Chroma Conclave's attack on Tal'Dorei. If so, your life in the city-state might have been a relatively peaceful one, dwelling among the engineers, artisans, and merchants seeking to capitalize upon Whitestone's reputation as an up-and-coming center of trade, culture, and invention.
	When you choose this background, decide whether you were a member of the Rifle Corps, the Pale Guard, or the Whitestone Hunters. The "Whitestone" section in chapter 3 has more information about the Pale Guard, as well as the armaments and militia in the city-state. See below for more information on the Whitestone Hunters.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Your choice of two of the following: Athletics, Perception, or Survival
	• Weapon Proficiencies: Firearms
	• Languages: One of your choice

      <name>Feature: Legacy of Secrecy</name>
      <text>You have been entrusted with the use and care of a weapon both powerful and terrifying. The rifle you wield might transform the face of warfare and life in Tal'Dorei. It is a weapon that haunts the mind of its creator, Percival de Rolo, manifesting as a pain that lives always behind his kind eyes.
	You were granted a musket or a pistol (as described in the fifth edition core rules) by your commander in the Whitestone Rifle Corps. This weapon is a symbol of your status, and when you display it, other folk around you—particularly adventurers, mercenaries, guards, engineers, and weapons enthusiasts—treat you differently. You might be seen as a noble defender of the people, a selfish hoarder of power, or anything in between, at the GM's discretion.</text>

      <name>Feature: Rifle Corps Relationship</name>
      <text>You are—or were—a member of an elite and trusted band of Whitestone's staunchest defenders. Work with your GM to determine your current relationship with the Rifle Corps. If your campaign starts in Whitestone, you might be an active member of that unit. Otherwise, you can use the Rifle Corps Relationships table for suggestions.

Rifle Corps Relationship:
d6 | Current Relationship
1 | I retired honorably from the Rifle Corps—and now it's time for me to pursue my own adventures.
2 | I'm on an important mission to protect Whitestone or guard one of our allies.
3 | Whitestone is in trouble, and I was sent away to seek help.
4 | I don't think firearms technology should be kept secret, so I escaped from the Rifle Corps with my weapon and am on the run.
5 | I was on a mission with my company when I got separated from them. Now I need to find my way back home.
6 | My weapon was stolen. I built a new one, but I can't return home until I've tracked down the thief and recovered the original. (Whitestone Hunter variant only)</text>
      <roll description="Current">1d6</roll>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Variant Feature: Whitestone Hunter</name>
      <text>As elite as they are, the members of the Whitestone Rifle Corps do not represent the apex of firearms skill in Whitestone. A clandestine group of elite soldiers and survivalists is drawn secretly from the Rifle Corps ranks. Called the Whitestone Hunters, these soldiers are special operatives of the de Rolo family, and loyally serve as spies, bodyguards, and even assassins when the job requires it. Though few officially know of them, rumors of the Whitestone Hunters' existence swirl constantly throughout the city-state, often in response to their activities after having been loaned out to protect Whitestone's allies.
	You are one of these Whitestone Hunters, even if just a trainee (if you're starting your campaign at low levels). You have the ear of the lord and lady of Whitestone, though you must exercise this privilege graciously lest you lose it.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Those who join the Whitestone Rifle Corps become members of an elite and trusted band known as the city-state's staunchest defenders. But this means working with your GM to determine why you're not at home protecting Whitestone. Perhaps you took on a mission to guard someone on behalf of the de Rolo family, or you might have been separated from your company while on an assignment. Either way, you find yourself embroiled now in a series of new adventures as you try to make your way back home.
	Your bond is likely associated with your comrades-in-arms or with Whitestone itself. Your ideal could be tied to justice or protection, but could also be a secretive, selfish perversion of those virtues.

d8 | Personality Trait
1 | I want to make a good impression at all times. That means keeping my clothes and gear clean and in top condition.
2 | I don't like being the center of attention. I'd rather let someone else do the talking while I watch their back.
3 | I feel safe only if I'm carrying my trusty rifle. And my dagger. And my concealed pistol. Oh, and of course my….
4 | I don't trust people with my secrets easily, so it feels like a big deal when someone else shares a secret with me.
5 | I like coming up with solutions to problems using my esoteric knowledge of natural philosophy.
6 | Everyone around me takes things so seriously. Sometimes I just want to let loose and have fun!
7 | Knowing things that other people don't know makes me feel special and important.
8 | I'm most at home in woods and mountains, where everything feels at once familiar, always growing and changing.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Responsibility. I have a duty to protect the people of Whitestone and to uphold the trust placed in me by the de Rolos. (Lawful)
2 | Militarization. Everyone should have access to the most powerful weapons available, so they can defend themselves effectively. (Evil)
3 | Cooperation. Any problem can be solved as long as people are willing to work together. (Good)
4 | Camaraderie. It's important to have people you can trust to help out in a fight—and to uncork a bottle together afterward. (Any)
5 | Context. There are no universal rights or wrongs. Every choice depends on the details of the situation. (Chaotic)
6 | Secrecy. Information is valuable, but it can also be dangerous. I'll keep my mouth shut and gather as much intel as I can. (Neutral)

d6 | Bond
1 | I never knew what to do with myself until I joined the Rifle Corps. Now I have a purpose and comrades to give me direction.
2 | One of my fellow Rifle Corps soldiers saved my life—and then I saved theirs. That kind of bond lasts forever.
3 | Whitestone is the best city in all of Tal'Dorei. Nowhere else has been blessed by the Dawnfather and has a clock that tracks the movement of the stars!
4 | My quick thinking saved a noble from assassination, and she showed me great kindness in return. I daren't say it, but I'm more loyal to her than I am to the de Rolos.
5 | My weapon is my life. I clean it, repair it, and care for it—and it serves me loyally in return.
6 | The people of Whitestone cared for my family when we had nothing. I promise to repay their compassion with my service.

d6 | Flaw
1 | Who cares about keeping this gun safe? "Don't let it fall into the wrong hands!" Ha! It's only a matter of time before someone slips up and these weapons are everywhere.
2 | I think being part of the Rifle Corps is so cool. I love telling people about my position so I can impress them.
3 | My weapon was stolen. I built a new one, but I can't return home until I've tracked down the thief and recovered the original.
4 | I'm tired of protecting spoiled people who don't know how to protect themselves.
5 | I shoot first and ask questions later.
6 | The first and only time I killed someone, it changed my life. I still dream about it, and I'll never be the carefree person I was before.</text>

      <text>Charlatans can be seen in most markets separating fools from their hard-earned coin, and there is no shortage of fools. Some choose instead to exploit the upper class, claiming that the ignorance of spoilt children is far more lucrative, if a little riskier. Ranging from the lowliest of hustlers selling miracle cure-alls to the most audacious con artists, all charlatans have a knack for fooling those unfortunate enough to cross their paths.

	• Skill Proficiency: Deception.
	• Additional Equipment: a lockbox with a secret compartment, a forged Merchant's Guild membership certificate, imitation fine clothes.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>False Identity</name>
      <text>Upon spending an hour writing and talking to the right people, and succeeding on a medium-DC Charisma (Deception) check, you can create yourself a new identity with fake identification.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Rank 1 - Peddler</name>
      <text>You are used to lying through your teeth, telling people whatever they want to hear in order to separate them from their money. It keeps you fed and one step ahead of the law, but you'll need a way to run bigger scams if you want to make real money.

Holdings:
	• A stash of counterfeit items that you sell and scam people with.
	• A secluded stoop that you use as a shelter against the elements near your place of "business"

Progression:
You are recruited by a gang of Hustlers, or create your own group, to participate in more organized and larger-scale scams.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Rank 2 - Hustler</name>
      <text>You have started to work in a group as a face man, expanding your "clientele" with more lucrative cons, such as passing off colored glass as gemstones, or bleeding wealthy marks dry with long cons.

Holdings:
	• A group of miscreants that assist your cons, with whom you split the spoils of your larceny.

Progression:
You must acquire or create plans for a large-scale con and procure the necessary elements.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Rank 3 - Con Artist</name>
      <text>You have become more daring in your approach, orchestrating swindles that require planning, resources, and teamwork in pursuit of a big payday. You may set your gang about duplicating famous paintings to be sold in foreign cities, for example, or forging property title deeds in order to sell a building you do not own.

Holdings:
	• A team of charismatic swindlers and skilled forgers who can recreate items at your request with great accuracy and detail.
	• An unmarked warehouse in a disreputable part of town, where you can store and create forged items and oversee your operations.

Progression:
Successfully executing a grand con that draws the outrage of a great noble household, religious faction, or other powerful institution. It also makes you famous among other criminals.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Rank 4 - Mastermind</name>
      <text>You have become something of a legend within the underground. Up-and-coming swindlers approach you to learn at your feet. Whether you pass on your skills or fleece your new flock is up to you.

Holdings:
	• Many detailed plans of cons you have devised or procured.
	• A network of talented individuals who work at your behest, aiding you in orchestrating your ploys.</text>

      <name>Cutthroat</name>
      <text>Some crooks lie to get what they want. Some steal it when its owner isn't looking. Then there are those who walk up to a target and explain the deal: give me what I want or bad things will happen to you. Call it "protection" or call it extortion, it is perhaps the most straightforward form of crime, favored by the violent and the ruthless.
	Most Cutthroats start out working in a pre-established gang, collecting fees and extracting payments on behalf of a boss. A small gang might be responsible for shaking down a handful of businesses, while the most powerful of crime lords may influence prominent cities or regions.

	• Skill Proficiency: Intimidation.

Some will even go out of their way to source rare and valuable items that you require, if they believe doing so will earn your favor.

Holdings:
	• A group of thugs that you command, overseeing their various ploys.
	• Knowledge of back alleys and slipways that allow you and your group to escape unpursued by local law enforcement.
	• A rundown establishment that you and your fellow henchmen operate out of.

Your group of thugs has progressed in size to exert control over an entire village or district within a city. A sizable collection of shop owners that you can regularly exploit for "protection".</text>

      <name>Rank 3 - Gang Boss</name>

Holdings:
	• Multiple warehouses and business fronts to launder and store your spoils until a suitable buyer can be located.

      <name>Burglar</name>
      <text>Burglars break into and steal from houses, storefronts, and warehouses, primarily operating out of major cities and ports. While thieving is a risky pursuit, the hardest part can be finding a buyer for rare and valuable items. The more unique the good, the more likely its original owner will want it returned, cutting your profit margin considerably.
	Goods and valuables generally need to be sold through a fence: someone who will purchase your stolen goods, sell them to unknowing customers, and take a cut of your profits.

      <name>Rank 1 - Snatcher</name>
      <text>Breaking into homes in the lower end of town is generally your trade. Authorities only worry about civilians with the power to cause a stir; everyone else is on their own. Locks in this end of town are easy to pick, if there is a lock at all. For the same reason, though, there is less to steal.

Holdings:
	• A safehouse in the poor district, used to store stolen goods and serving as emergency lodgings.

You rob a well-to-do store in a reputable district, gaining notoriety and a big payday.</text>

      <text>Working in a team, while risky, allows for heists that would be beyond the reach of any one burglar, no matter how skilled. Increasingly, when someone has an ambitious crime planned and needs to assemble a team of "the best," they reach out to you.

Holdings:
	• A team of specialist thieves who operate under your instruction to execute more ambitious heists.
	• A contact working inside an establishment which you plan on robbing, who provides you information on the routine of the occupants, the location of valuable items, and escape routes.

Progression:
Membership in an established Thieves' Guild in a major city or town.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Rank 3 - Heist Master</name>
      <text>Your skill as both a burglar and a leader has grown considerably over time. Whether by virtue of your own confidence or a message from the divine, you believe that you are capable of executing a major heist, with the right preparation and henchmen of course. Will it be a priceless painting you have been tasked with acquiring for a prospective buyer? A slovenly prince whose private affairs you seek to meddle in, having acquired his signet ring?

Holdings:
	• You hold a senior position in the Thieves' Guild, instructing junior members in lockpicking, housebreaking, and evading law enforcers.
	• You uncover evidence of an attempted assassination on the life of a noble whose estate you robbed.

Progression:
You orchestrate a large-scale heist to rob the estate of a local noble.</text>

After all, knowledge is power, and you've risen to a level where power is mandatory.

    <trait>
      <name>Specialty</name>
      <text>The Bandit Coalition is a rather loose organization of rogues and brigands, but there is still a degree of specialization within the ranks. This ensures that everyone knows what their job is and lessens confusion in the heat of a robbery. You can select your bandit specialty from the Bandit Specialty table, or roll randomly.

Bandit Specialty:
d6 | Specialty
1 | Lookout
2 | Lifter
3 | Thug
4 | Runner
5 | Hustler
6 | Captain

Lookouts typically watch the roads for any signs of Perch Guard patrols, signalling the team to bail if a heist looks too risky. They also keep an eye out for potential marks.

Lifters are the specialist thieves of an operation. They are usually as adept at pick-pocketing as they are at sneaking up behind a cart to liberate its valuables.

Thugs are the muscle of a bandit group, and use their size and strength to intimidate merchants into giving up without a fight. They also keep other bandits in line, at the captain's discretion.

Runners are the messengers and scouts of the Coalition, serving to smuggle pilfered goods to fences. Additionally, they pass information throughout the different camps of the organization. Their job often finds them working alone which makes them particularly vulnerable.

Hustlers are inveterate con-artists. Through careful planning and execution, their diversions can keep cart drivers occupied just long enough for the lifters to do their work, or create a seamless opening for an ambush.

Captains are the glue that holds each bandit team together, providing leadership, and stamping out dissention where necessary, often with force. They are figures that inspire with their skill and bravado.</text>

      <text>Despite the inherent vertical aspects of birdfolk culture, you have always felt safer and more at peace with your feet firmly planted on the soil. You are practical and level-headed, but due to your different perspective on the world, other birdfolk see you as quirky or unsettling. Your unique insight allows you to connect with the humblefolk who live under the forest canopy in ways perch-dwelling birdfolk cannot.

      <name>An Odd Bird</name>
      <text>Among birdfolk you are somewhere between an oddity and an outcast. Some consider your aversion to heights a rejection of birdfolk culture, leading many to find you off-putting.
	Choose how your community regards you or roll on the table below to determine how you fit in.

Community:
d6 | Community Place
1 | I am considered weak or unskilled and many treat me like a fledgling.
2 | I am looked upon as a traitor to my people.
3 | My family wants me to return to the perch, but I just can't.
4 | I am not welcome back in my home perch.
5 | I am viewed as an oddity, someone for others to laugh at and tease.

      <name>Feature: Find Another Path</name>
      <text>Since you have lived your life close to the ground, you are familiar with the undergrowth in the same way other birdfolk are familiar with the canopy. You can always recall the general layout of the terrain around you while traveling along the forest floor. If your path is ever blocked by an obstacle that requires you to climb or otherwise gain height to circumvent it, you can always find a way around, so long as such a path exists. Additionally, you are adept at finding shelter in the Wood while traveling, and can usually locate a suitable safe shelter (a cave, a tree hollow, or bramble thicket) somewhere on the forest floor for you and up to five other creatures.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>Birdfolk who are grounded often find ways to cope with their aversion to canopy life. Some have completely forsaken their old lives in favor of new ones in undergrowth communities, while others keep ties with family and friends in the perches where they were born.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>There are legends within the Wood, of birdfolk blessed by the wind who are destined to soar over any and all obstacles. When a chick is born with special markings or unique feather patterns, or when they survive a dramatic childhood event, some folks brand them "Wind-Touched". Though a few dismiss the notion of the Wind-Touched as superstition, others heap reverence upon those believed chosen. According to legend, one who is touched by the wind will never feel at ease anywhere but high in the forest canopy, with the wind in their feathers.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Acrobatics, Performance
	• Tool Proficiencies: One type of wind Musical Instrument
	• Languages: You can speak as well as understand Auran

      <name>Title and Blessing</name>
      <text>For some birdfolk, the moniker of Wind-Touched is merely a title, a symbol of their devotion to the wind and the natural world. Others have been told since birth that they were blessed by the wind, much in the way the Amaranthine Reya was in the old tales.

5 | I am destined to rule, as my ancestors before me have.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I boast about my own triumphs, and belittle the accomplishments of others.
2 | Bound by honor, I can never back down from a challenge, nor can I let those who undervalue my name go unchallenged.

4 | I like to flaunt my wealth, and I spare no expense.

1 | I always have an exit strategy in mind if things go poorly.
2 | You can't survive in this grim city without a good sense of humor, but I have a taste for gallows humor.
3 | I try to work in the thin grey area between the squabbling factions, squeezing under their radar when possible. The less I am seen, the better.
4 | If you spot danger, it is best to avoid it, that's how you survive.
5 | Drakkenheim is a dangerous place. But I can navigate it with my eyes closed. No one else I've ever met is as good as I am.
6 | In order to survive the monsters of Drakkenheim, one must be a monster of Drakkenheim.
7 | Take everything you can from the dead, take it from the living if you can. If you are to survive, you must take any opportunity to scavenge.
8 | I will never give up until I reclaim what I lost in these ruins.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Self-Reliance. I won't risk my life for others. Everyone must fend for themselves - better you than me. (Evil)

3 | I am convinced my family is alive in the city somewhere. I hear their voices call to me at night.
4 | I don't trust anyone easily. I'll sleep with one eye open even around my companions, for Drakkenheim makes monsters of us all.
5 | The years spent here have turned me to a vice, I very much rely on that vice to get me through my days.
6 | I hear voices constantly. Sometimes I get distracted with conversations with people who are not there.</text>

      <text>On the fringes of the civilized world, parents warn their children not to wander away from their homes, especially at night. The many creatures that haunt the forests, from the faerie-folk to the minions of the Great Beast, spell doom for the innocent who stray too far into the darkness.
	You failed to heed your parents' warnings, and you were taken. In fact, those who know of your experience use that word to describe you: Taken. You do not remember what happened to you while you were away, but through some mysterious and possibly fortunate circumstances, you wandered back into town after months or years of going missing. Maybe the fairies whisked you off to some magical realm. Maybe evil cultists of an Arch Daemon held you prisoner, planning to sacrifice you to their dark leader when the time was right, and you found a way to escape. Maybe one of the Beast's warped and feral minions took a liking to you and kept you as a pet. Whatever your story, you can't remember your time away. But that doesn't mean you weren't changed by it.

	Then a miracle happened. A stranger came to you and offered to help. The stranger brought forth strange medicines, providing you with curative draughts and elixirs. And just as the disease reached its worst stages, the symptoms began to vanish. Before long, you were cured of the disease. The sores and scars of the disease, however, still play across your body - an unsubtle reminder of the terrible scourge you faced.
	The stranger left you after the treatments concluded, but you retained some of the knowledge that the healer used while caring for you. Those who marvel at your recovery also fear you: they harbor some suspicion that you made deals with dark powers to drive away the disease.

Your work uncovered hidden evil that likely saved the lives of countless innocents. However, on more than one occasion the zeal of yourself or others brought low individuals who were themselves innocent.
	After a crisis of conscience, you left the ranks of the inquisitors. Leaving those ranks is itself a dangerous prospect, but you could no longer abide. Maybe someone you love and care for starting showing arcane affinities that would have led to their destruction. Maybe you did. Maybe the last investigation you performed opened your eyes to new realities.
	Now you are living with a target on your back. Your former peers don't take kindly to people leaving their ranks. Those whom you persecuted have not forgotten your deeds. But life must still be lived, and there's more than one way to find and destroy the evil in the world.

	• Additional Equipment: A begging bowl or tin cup for collecting coins, a crutch, spare scraps of cloth, and a small stick of grease paint.

      <name>Friends In Low Places</name>
      <text>Upon spending an hour speaking to other beggars and making a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can manipulate the underground currents of information that flow throughout the city. This allows you to manipulate the mood of the lower classes for or against a specific individual, group, or decision. The unrest caused may manifest itself in a number of ways, at the GM's discretion.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Rank 1 - Street Beggar</name>
      <text>Driven by desperation, you are forced to the streets to earn what you need to survive. Poor decisions or bad luck drained away whatever funds you managed to scrape together, and you have no real home to return to. As an adventurer you have certain alternatives not available to most, but between forays into the wilds the fact remains that you have no steady occupation and no place to call home.

Holdings:
	• A spot in an alley that you have managed to stake out and must defend against newcomers.
	• The name of a sympathetic merchant with space in a high-traffic area of the city.

Progression:
Gain the friendship of a local business owner by performing odd jobs or doing some other service.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Rank 2 - Mendicant</name>
      <text>A common sight to locals, you have moved up to a better location in a busy street or plaza. You no longer have to fight for your place and have gained the tolerance of the guards and the friendship of other local beggars. By this time you have established a begging "pitch" designed to attract attention without inconveniencing those passing by. This could be a persona or some sort of script that you devise in order to amuse or elicit sympathy from the general populace.

Holdings:
	• A safe place to sleep near a merchant stall or building.
	• Friendship with local beggars and a few local traders, who may offer you some spare coin, food, or odd jobs from time to time.

Progression:
Split a significant windfall with other beggars, earning their loyalty.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Rank 3 - Gutter Baron</name>
      <text>You have risen to a position of prominence, such as it is, among the beggars in your city. You are able to direct the actions of a number of other paupers and split the rewards in a far more efficient manner than they could do alone, and they respect and defer to you in important decisions.

Holdings:
	• Squatter's rights in an abandoned building.
	• A handful of other beggars who defer to your authority and aid you in gathering money and information.
	• Knowledge of an illicit deal that took place in an alley in the dead of night, which implicates a minor noble.

Progression:
Perform a great service for the poor of the city either by thwarting the plans of a ranking noble or leveraging your influence to gain a powerful aristocrat patron.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Rank 4 - Beggar King</name>
      <text>You have become the undisputed master of the city's destitute population, and none of them act without your knowledge. Having control of such a wide-ranging network of informants and agents puts you at the center of the city's political power struggles. Even leaders of criminal organizations know that you are not someone to be trifled with.

Holdings:
	• A comfortable hideout hidden in the slums or sewers.
	• A network of beggars, informants, and criminals that keep you informed of all illicit activity within the city.
	• Influence with at least one major player in local crime or politics.</text>

      <name>Vagabond</name>
      <text>Those paupers who choose to leave their past behind and take to the open road are known as vagabonds. Some do so in an attempt to flee whatever painful memories caused their descent into poverty, while others hold out hope of starting a new life in another city. Most don't survive outside the protective walls of a guarded settlement, but those that do often find little welcome in the cities they visit. Vagabonds must therefore work hard to gain trust and forge what connections they may have in each place they visit, and invariably they must move on before they wear out their welcome.

	• Skill Proficiency: Insight
	• Additional Equipment: A walking stick, an old wool cloak, and an iron pot.

    <trait>
      <name>Rank 1 - Outcast</name>
      <text>For whatever reason, you can't go home again. Bereft of family, property, and support, you are now cut loose to wander and survive as best you can. You stand out more as a stranger in smaller settlements, where people shun you as if you have the plague, but even in larger cities you are viewed with suspicion by the local authorities.

Holdings:
	• A tarnished compass.
	• A posting from a town seeking able-bodied workers to deal with a recent disaster.

Survive a major storm on the road or participate meaningfully in a town's internal disputes.</text>

Holdings:
	• News from far parts of your current region that are not public knowledge.

Save the life of one of your contacts.</text>

For good or ill, you are recognized as you travel, much as a caravan leader or traveling merchant.

      <text>Unterland was the first of the provinces to host blood sport arenas, back in the days before the formation of the Bürach Empire. Since then the practice has been driven underground, but, like poison spreading silently throughout a healthy body, it has infiltrated nearly every major city.
	Ostensibly illegal, you can almost always find small groups of desperate individuals putting their lives on the line for the amusement and enrichment of others. This hidden network of arenas has recently organized into the self-proclaimed Fighter's Guild and developed a series of coded phrases and symbols to identify its members. Following the unspoken rule of Etharis, it is a place where only the strong survive.

      <name>Raider</name>
      <text>You have been trained as a warrior with the specific aim of raiding other clans or settlements. Raiding parties must be able to move quickly, strike hard, and carry off enough goods to help support the tribe. The coordination to do all this requires intense training and forges a strong sense of comradery between raiders. Part of this comradery involves a strong sense of competition, each raider vying to perform daring acts or to carry back the best loot. The aftermath of a raid often involves raucous singing, drinking, and revelry, an adrenaline high buoyed by the plentiful food and drink obtained from the raided settlement.

	• Skill Proficiency: Intimidation
	• Additional Equipment: A tankard, a sack, a whetstone, and several torches.

      <name>Rank 2 - Pillager</name>
      <text>As a full member of the raiding party, you are trained to strike hard and fast, then escape with whatever loot you can find.

Holdings:
	• A younger warrior assigned to maintain your equipment and carry your loot.
	• Your pick of the goods seized on raids, in order of seniority.

Your underlings look to you for the tactics to use during the raid, and you must reign in the more reckless raiders lest they go too far.

Holdings:
	• A fine dwelling within the village, showcasing trophies from prior raids.
	• Command over a raiding party and a voice at any war council.

      <text>Profession Dice are the in-game advantages provided to characters by their background profession. Characters can add their Profession Die to skill or ability checks according to any Talents they have selected.
	In addition, a character always adds their Profession Die when rolling for Profession Abilities.
	A character's Profession Die is determined by their rank, and shown in the table below:

Profession Die Table:

    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Historically, inquisitors were cathar detectives who investigated crimes both mundane and supernatural. They were known for traveling to remote parishes plagued by unexplained murders, and for exposing werewolves living among normal humans. During Avacyn's absence, when the archangel was trapped within the demonic prison known as the Helvault, the inquisitors led a series of brutal forays into Kessig and the Gavony Moorland. They executed suspected lycanthropes with little or no proof, and punished accused heretics in unsanctioned trials. With Avacyn's madness, this savage form of inquisition has become the norm, and inquisitors who still pry into dark mysteries have become a minority.

      <text>Even in the carefully constructed and curated city-state of Naktamun, and in the presence of the five gods, some people rebel against the doctrines of the God-Pharaoh. They don't challenge the existence of the gods, of course, for those gods are visible nearly every day in the streets of the city. Nor do they question the fact of life after death, which is plain to see in the anointed mummies that surround them, as well as the marauding mummies outside the Hekma. Rather, these dissenters simply refuse to follow the ordained course of life that leads to the glorious afterlife.
	Some dissenters are spurred by fear, not wanting to subject themselves to a violent death in the trials (or in training for the trials). Some are moved by conscience, unwilling to kill their crop-mates in the trials. For while they cannot deny that the gods exist, they can deny that the gods are just—and can fight to prove that the dictates of an unjust god need not be obeyed. Some believe that one god (probably Bontu) has corrupted the process of the trials and the path to the afterlife. Others correctly intuit that the God-Pharaoh did not actually have the people's best interests in mind when he ordered their society.

      <text>An initiate's life is focused on the trials, but it doesn't need to be all about the trials. Though some initiates are highly focused on their training, most undergo that training while also experiencing joy, sorrow, love, loss, anger, jealousy, hope, faith, delight—the whole range of mortal emotions and experience. The afterlife might be a constant presence in every initiate's mind, but it is the culmination of a life well-lived—not a replacement for it.

Some combination of your natural aptitude, your crop's needs, and your teachers' assessment while you were an acolyte led you to focus your training in one particular area of specialization—hand-to-hand combat, long-range combat, or spellcasting. But only a well-rounded initiate can be called truly worthy of the afterlife.
	If you are a hand-to-hand specialist, consider the barbarian, fighter, monk, paladin, or rogue classes. As a long-range combat specialist, you might be a fighter, a ranger, or a rogue. If you are a spellcasting specialist, you might be a bard, sorcerer, or wizard. And beyond this initial choice, you might consider multiclassing or using feats to round out your skills in all three areas.

      <name>Feature: Trials of the Five Gods</name>
      <text>Your life is oriented around your participation in the five trials that will determine your worthiness in the afterlife. While you prepare for and undergo those trials, you have constant access to training. A comfortable place to live and regular meals are provided to you by servitor mummies (the anointed) under the supervision of viziers. You can enjoy these benefits only as long as you obey the societal norms of Naktamun—training for the trials (with or without your crop), obeying the orders of the gods, and following the instructions of their viziers. If you violate these norms, you risk being treated as a dissenter. See "Trials of the Five Gods" for more information about undertaking the trials and their rewards.
	The five gods are the effective rulers of Amonkhet. They are not the creators of the plane, but they are its stewards while the people of Naktamun await the return of the God-Pharaoh. The five gods believe they were created by the God-Pharaoh, who charged them with teaching the people the ways of the God-Pharaoh, and with protecting them until he comes.
	The five gods embody the five virtues the God-Pharaoh wishes to cultivate in those who will become his Eternals in the afterlife. Each god is responsible for modeling and teaching one of those virtues to the acolytes and initiates of Naktamun, and then testing those initiates to ensure that they have mastered their teachings. Thus, they are present during the acolytes' first lessons, during the Ceremony of Measuring, during the initiates' intense training, and at each of the trials that are part of an initiate's journey.
	In the absence of the God-Pharaoh, only the gods can determine whether initiates have proven themselves worthy of the glory of the afterlife. The gods in turn prove their own worthiness by executing their duties infallibly. They make the trials as challenging as possible to ensure that only the most worthy are selected.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Almsgivers, as one would expect, come in many different flavors; yet they all find themselves dedicating their lives to philanthropic ventures or making charitable donations to the needy through their talents, money or time - wherever they are found. Some almsgivers study to eventually become healers or priests, others join or use their families wealth to fund organizations which are able to cross borders. There is also a rare sub-class of these dedicated humanitarians who take up arms against those who ashamedly take advantage of the poor. It is a natural step up from charity worker to adventurer, as the poor, the needy and the hungry are never far from sight.
	Why did you take the life of an almsgiver and charity worker? Did you come from a religious background? Were you once rich yourself? Did your compassion for all creatures offer you no alternative, but to become part of an altruist organization which could reach across the borders of neighboring communities and kingdoms? Discuss with your DM to determine the reason for your charity work, or you can roll on the table below to determine how your altruism manifested itself.

	• Tool Proficiencies: Herbalism Kit
	• Equipment: Herbalism Kit, winter blanket, a notebook full of herbal remedies and favorite prayers, cooking pots, set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 5gp.

      <text>Almsgivers are naturally empathic towards those in need. They feel the pain of others intimately, so much so that they can go to great lengths to alleviate it. They very often have a gathering of like-minded comrades or cohorts who they readily turn to for help. They are also very well respected, or even loved in certain towns, groups or factions. In their never-ending desire to unburden the suffering of others, not every almsgiver remains on the side of the law though; using their knowledge, connections and friends to help steal from the most fortunate in society, to give to the poor. However, one thing is for certain, almsgivers have a higher sense of purpose than most, with many of them finding solace in religion.

	How did you die? It probably wasn't of old age. Spells like raise dead can bring back those who die before old age takes them, but after dying of old age there is almost no magic which can bring a person back to life. Was it combat? An accident? A disease?
	How long were you dead? Spells like true resurrection allow a character to return from death after as many as 200 years. How has the world changed politically, technologically, and culturally since your death? What remains of your family, friends, and personal life?
	What was your life after death like? Did you spend time in the glory of eternal battle is Ysgard? Did you enjoy the paradise of Elysium? Were you tortured in the Nine Hells or Abyss? Do you remember nothing from that time?
	Maybe you didn't completely pass on, but lived life as an undead, such as a ghost or vampire. Why did you become such a being? What acts did you commit that you now regret? Who still thinks of you as a monster?
	Finally someone brought you back. Who was it, and why? Maybe it was to face an old enemy. Maybe it was a loved one who searched for a long time and sacrificed much to revive you. Maybe you were brought back for a secret only you knew. How did this person bring you back? Was it straightforward magic? What about a spell like reincarnate, which could bring your spirit back in the body of a different humanoid race? Or maybe it was some other magic that has a more sinister secret.

      <text>You lived a life of adventure already and retired to something quieter. You thought you were done and to that end may have given away all your old gear and spent all your treasure. Little did you know something would pull you back into your old life. If you choose this background, you have some exciting questions to answer.
	You determine what your past looked like. What adventures have you already had? How much time did you spend adventuring before retirement? Who was your most-hated enemy? Who did you adventure with? Why did you hang it up?
	Something happened that made you lose your edge and finely honed adventuring skills. Has age or luxurious retirement made you soft? Did a physical or magical accident take some abilities from you? Did a supernatural force steal your mojo?
	You have decided to walk the road of adventure once again. Why? Was it because you ran out of gold and want to earn some more the only way you know how? Did you become restless in retirement and are now seeking the thrill of battle? Are you out to prove you can still live up to your legend? Are you out for vengeance? A noble quest? To tie up one final loose end you didn't realize until now was undone? Whatever the reason, you're back on the road and ready to dive into another dungeon.

3 | Obsession. I get too fixated on small issues or details, losing sight of the bigger picture and what's truly important.
4 | Comparative. I tend to compare everyone's struggles to my own, making it hard for me to understand or empathize with others.
5 | Arrogance. I can't help but abuse the gratitude of those I help, letting it go to my head and treating others poorly as a result.
6 | Rebel. I don't respect authority and treat everyone as equals, which often gets me in trouble and makes me seem insolent.</text>

      <text>In a world wrought with instability and strife, the value of secrecy and stealth cannot be overstated. Espionage reigns supreme and those with the ability to blend in seamlessly with their surroundings are highly prized. Such individuals are often aloof, with a guarded air about them as they keep their true identities close to the vest. Every step they take, every word they utter, is calculated to maintain their disguise. The weight of their responsibility can lead to paranoia, constantly scanning their surroundings for any hint of danger.
	Yet, not all who walk in shadows are wrought with anxiety. Some have a natural magnetism, a charm that allows them to slip into a role like a second skin.

      <text>You don't belong in this world. You come from an alien realm where magic doesn't exist, technology is far more advanced, and the adventures you now face are confined only to fiction. You don't know how you were transported to this world or why you were brought here, but you are trying to make the best of a perplexing situation.
	Consider how long you have been here, and how you have managed to procure the powers associated with your class since arriving. Have you been stuck here for years, learning the art of some class as a way to survive? Did you appear not only in an unfamiliar place but also in an unfamiliar body, maybe of some inhuman race that doesn't exist in your own world, which comes with instinctual powers and talents that you're still learning to command? Also think about your previous life, what skills it would have taught you and how those now apply to your new life.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Any two skills that are not Arcana, History, or Religion
	• Tool Proficiencies: Two of your choice from the following: any artisan's tools besides alchemist's supplies, any musical instrument, any gaming set
	• Equipment: A mobile phone with 0% battery, a wallet with dozen banknotes of a currency not accepted in this world, a ring of keys, set of strange clothes, and a pouch of 10 gp

      <name>Feature: Modern Knowledge</name>
      <text>While you came into this unfamiliar world without a copper piece to your name, the advanced knowledge you brought with you has given you something of value to offer. You are well versed in a field that is farther advanced in your original world than the world you are in now. It could be medicine, mathematics, engineering, a craft, or anything else that makes sense for your character.
	In order to secure a life for yourself, you contributed this knowledge to some organization that it was relevant to. For example, you might have taught a university the secrets of calculus, or instructed a blacksmith's guild in how to make stronger steel. The organization considers themselves indebted to you for your contribution, and are willing to support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle. They consider you a member of their organization, although you may have to pay monthly dues to gain the full benefits of membership.
	The technology you introduced may cause a disruption in the world and its balance of power. Discuss with your DM what impact your knowledge has on the world now that it has been introduced, if any.</text>

      <text>Displaced characters are strangers in a strange land, stuck in a place where everything they thought was fictional is now real. They might see this as a call to action to become a protagonist like in all the stories they grew up with, or they may only care about making it out of these adventures alive. Either way, they are defined by a culture that those around them can't come close to relating to.

Years of your life were spent as a being that haunts the nightmares of many. What were you? What terrible deeds did you commit? What magic transformed you into your new form?

Learning to live as something else is a struggle, even if your mind is committed to the task. Memories, enemies, and lost friends from your old life haunt you.

Within the confines of this mysterious magical realm, those taken in such a manner usually do not survive long especially when Hags or other dark Fey creatures are involved. However, some do manage to avoid such a fate and are raised as slaves, servants, playthings, or companions, etc.
	You were more fortunate than most of your ilk surviving long enough to demonstrate a natural connection to the Feywild and reveal yourself to be Feytouched, i.e. a kindred spirit. Earning your freedom, you were then permitted to come and go from the Feywild as you please.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You were what most common folk are - a farmer. You worked on a lord's estate, their land, or you worked for a company and you produced resources from the land in return for food, shelter, clothing, protection, and other benefits. Farmers focus on raising living things and harvesting various useful goods - mostly food - from the land. Farmers make up the vast majority of the peasantry, alongside other raw resource producers, such as miners and fishermen. Farmers are a hearty, enduring folk, they work long hours under the sun often doing dirty and exhausting or even disgusting work.
	How did you become a farmer, and for how long were you one? What did you do on your farm? Were you the landlord of the farm, or were you just a farmhand? And what caused you to leave that life behind? Was your home destroyed by war? Were you cast out for some crime? Did you flee taxes you could not pay? Were you called to join the Lord's army? Was your home stolen by an unscrupulous rival? How did you learn your current profession?

	• Tool Proficiencies: Land Vehicles and Farm Implements
	• Languages: You only speak Common
	• Equipment: A farm implement (such as a pitchfork or shovel), a set of work clothes or common clothes, a wide brimmed hat, a sack containing 5 gp worth of trade goods, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp or 1d4 + 2 gp

1 | Rancher. You raised animals for slaughter most likely for food, but also for leather, furs, and other useful materials.
2 | Grazier. You harvested goods produced by animals such as milk, eggs, feathers, or wool.
3 | Stockman. You bred animals to sell for work or as pets such as guard dogs, racing horses, and griffons.
4 | Peasant. You harvested edible or useful plants such as wheat, corn crops, or apples at an orchard.
5 | Forester. You grew trees for ornament or construction such as trees grown for bow staves, boat masts, or buildings.
6 | Silk. You raised silk worms or another exotic animal, and harvested their silk.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Feature: Of The land</name>
      <text>You lack the formal education of the higher classes, but for how little you may know there is a great deal that you understand. You have a practical, working knowledge of astrology and meteorology, and can easily track the time and date as well as predict the weather within a few hours, or days if you're lucky. You understand the "secrets of life"; the needs of life (water, light, air, salt, etc.), the patterns of physical inheritance, and the connections between different plants and animals.
	At the DM's discretion, this can be represented by allowing a farmer to cast commune with nature once per long rest, except that the range is limited to environments common to you within 10 feet and you can only choose one of the first two choices.</text>

      <text>For better or for worse, you are just very normal. Among commoners and on the road, most people just don't notice you, and security checks at city gates or on the road are often brisk and half-hearted. People tend to trust that you're just another face in the crowd. However, whenever you are some place commoners should not be, or normally are not seen, you stand out like a sore thumb and draw a good deal of attention, one way or another. You are unlikely to be preceded by your reputation, if you even have one, and if you do, nobody expects you to be them.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Variant Feature: Work Until You Drop</name>
      <text>Now when most think about a Farmer, they don't exactly think of some complete badass going out to slay dragons, rescue consistently imperiled nobility, and save the day. More often than not they're simply seen as peasant; background individuals that aren't much of a threat. However, they can be a lot tougher than expected.
	As a Farmer, you aren't made to deal massive amount of damage right away. However, what you excel at is delivering constant damage and wearing an opponent out over time. You're used to playing the waiting game, and fighting creatures is no different for you. Every encounter with you is an endurance match that others don't often succeed in, as you are made to withstand quite a good deal of damage and frequently hinder your enemies.
	Whether or not you're some Joe Schmo that got roped into traveling with a band of adventurers one way or another, or a commoner who got fed up with the troubles you and your fellow peasants face and decided to solve them yourself: you are a formidable foe and constant nuisance to enemies you face, while being a humble teammate to work alongside of.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
      <text>When creating a Farmer, it is important to remember that is it not a class typically seen as the brave heroes out to save the world. You are usually the typical peasant or commoner that stays to the background while more flamboyant members of society move about the world and make an impact in it.
	As such, some important questions to ask would be: Why is your Farmer adventuring? Did they accidentally get roped into traveling with other adventurers and it's too hard to get out of it now? Did you want a life outside of working in the field all day? Or were you fed up with the everyday troubles your fellow peasants faced and decided to go out on your own to solve them?
	You can further expand on this depending on the campaign's background: Are there many troubles that you commoners face? Is the ruling body of where you live corrupt? Did you start out as a commoner? Or did you escape some other life and decide to settle down, only to somehow be pulled into drama once more?

      <text>You are someone who knows the value of a properly seasoned stew and can tell the difference between spices by sight, taste, scent, and even their texture. From the soldiers marching in the fields, to the warm haven of an inn, to the bowls of the largest keeps, to the homes of the common folk you know that food and need of food is what brings together everyone of every nation, religion, race, and creed. Food is your passion, it is your mission, it is your religion.
	You have made it your mission to taste and create only the finest and most expensive foods possible. You refuse to eat the bland slop of the masses and often insist on making your own food at inns. As a result of your passion for gourmet food you have spent a considerable amount of time in the presence of the wealthy elite, nobles, and even royalty and could easily pass muster among them. Some may even have heard of your famous dishes and will insist that you make it for them.

      <text>Nobles, politicians, criminals, the common man; hell, maybe even an orc or two. At some point in your life, you have been with all manner of society's finest and worst through your profession. Your profession, whether through freedom of choice, or a cruel twist of unfortunate events, is one that utilizes a very specific set of skills: the art of seduction. Though your circumstances may be unfortunate, you use them to your advantage. Whether it is using your body to persuade a client to change their mind on an issue, using your unique skill set to distract clients while you steal from right under their noses, or even playing the part of a cheap assassin.
	When making a character with this background ask yourself these question: What led your character to these circumstances? Was it a twisted and unfortunate fate? Or was it a vocation of choice? How much do you charge for your services? Are you self employed, or do you work under a pimp? Where do you work? Where is your place of work? These are the questions you must consider and consider wisely, for they will shape your character, in the beginning of their journey at least.

      <text>You are, or once were, a member of a cult — a religious splinter sect or a secret society of occult study. You might still be active within the cult, receiving orders from its secret masters. Or perhaps you've rejected its authority, and now the cult wants to bring you back into the fold... or silence you forever. In either case, you live at the crossroads of criminality and faith or arcane study.
	Work with your DM to determine the nature of the cult's devotion. It might be a god, celestial, demon, devil, dragon, fey, or genie. It might be a cabal dedicated to arcane study, with an archmage or lich at its head. A cult without strictly enforced rules is soon stamped out by the forces of orthodoxy, however; no matter what your cult's nature, their dictates present challenges in the daily lives of adherents.

      <text>You are familiar with wealth and status. You once carried a noble title, and your family still owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. Something in your past caused you to run from your family. Be it a banishment, voluntary exile to protect your family, or another reason, you no longer reap the rewards of your family's name. If your family still holds status and your relationship with them is still favorable, perhaps they send you gifts in hopes that you return safely. Alternatively, perhaps you were forced into exile and your family has stripped everything from you, including your name and rank.
	Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries or carried. A noble title doesn't stand on its own—it's connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you. Also work out the details of your reason for running away, and the impact that may have on your family, your house, your country, or even the world itself.
	Is your exile one that is barely spoken of and whispered only in rumors? Was your running away the talk of the town for weeks, fueling the gossip in taverns and inns? Was your banishment handled by the sovereign or by the head of your house? When you ran away, what state did you leave your house in? Is your family on the verge of collapse? Or are they even better off without you around?
	What was your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? To what lengths will you go to restore your position? How does the head of your family feel about your absence?
	Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family? If so, do you still wear them or shun your house and blame them for your predicament? How does your family feel about your use of their coat of arms, colors, or insignia? Are their punishments for using your family's name and status without the proper authority?
	These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.

5 | I found out a dark secret. Now my conscience won't let me stay. I must decide whether to protect or expose my house.
6 | My family has harsh coming-of-age expectations. I was expected to face a near-impossible task and chose to run away instead. My shame haunts me and my family.
7 | I fell in love with a member of a rival family and was ostracized for it. I hope to one day restore peace between our families with a marriage of our houses.

      <text>Scientists are people that believe discovery and invention are vital to progress, and seek knowledge about the world in which they live. You are one of these people... but you take things a bit too far. To most people, your ideas are crazy: unnecessary at best, and reprehensible at worst. Because of this, you're shunned by your community, though whether your "madness" is legitimate or just a label slapped on you by people who don't understand is up to you.
	You will want to discuss the reason(s) you left your home with your Dungeon Master. Did people harass you, or ignore you altogether? Were you run out of town for your bizarre experiments, or did you take your leave to try to find like-minded people? Are you searching for something obscure, or do you simply wish for freedom to study what and how you please?

	• Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, Animal Handling, and Medicine
	• Tool Proficiencies: Choose two from Alchemist's Supplies, Brewer's Supplies, Carpenter's Tools, Cook's Utensils, Mason's Tools, Smith's Tools, Tinker's Tools, Herbalism Kit, and Poisoner's Kit
	• Equipment: A set of common clothes, two sets of tools you are proficient with, a book on your field of study, an abacus, a piece of chalk, and a pouch containing 10 gp

      <text>Though they may have much in common, these are not the types of scholars that fill the halls of universities. They are radical free thinkers who are defined by ostracization. Greater society dismisses their ideas and goals as anything from foolish to evil, leaving them to work in their makeshift laboratories alone, for hours, days, or weeks at a time. They're obsessed. They're dedicated. Their ideas are strange — but rest assured, no two are the same.
