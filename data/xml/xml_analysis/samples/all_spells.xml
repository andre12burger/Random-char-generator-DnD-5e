    <text>Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature

You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.
	On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

You can spend 5 ki points to cast wall of fire.

Wall of Fire:
You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot think, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot think. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.
	When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
	One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

Additional Ki Points: When you cast this spell using 6 ki points, the damage increases to 6d8.

Gust of Wind:
A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell's duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.
	Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.
	The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.
	As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.

For example, if you affect a 30-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 15 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 15 feet, dig a trench up to 15 feet deep, and so on. You can't shape the ice to trap or injure a creature in the area.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

You can spend 6 ki points to cast wall of stone.

Wall of Stone:
A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least on other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.
	If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.
	The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. the wall doesn't need to be vertical or resting on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.
	If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.
	The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.
	If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

    <text>You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.

Aquatic Adaptation: You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

Change Appearance: You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.

Natural Weapons: You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.

    <text>This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast for each slot level above 1st.

Charmed:
	• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
	• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

    <text>By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as "a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard" or "a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat." You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.
	When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.

At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.

    <text>Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.
	The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target's game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.
	The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

    <text>This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature's game statistics).
	On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
	The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

    <text>Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can't animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.
	As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

Animated Object Statistics:
Size | HP | AC | Attack | Str | Dex
Tiny | 20 | 18 | +8 to hit, 1d4+4 damage | 4 | 18
Small | 25 | 16 | +6 to hit, 1d8+2 damage | 6 | 14
Medium | 40 | 13 | +5 to hit, 2d6+1 damage | 10 | 12
Large | 50 | 10 | +6 to hit, 2d10+2 damage | 14 | 10
Huge | 80 | 10 | +8 to hit, 2d12+4 damage | 18 | 6

An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.
	If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.

At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.

    <text>A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.
	Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

Targeted Effects: Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

Areas of Magic: The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.

Spells: Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

Magic Items: The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.
	A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

Magical Travel: Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.

Creatures and Objects: A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

Dispel Magic: Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.

    <text>This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.

Antipathy: The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

Sympathy: The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target.
	If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

Ending the Effect: If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.
	A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.

If the portal would open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and the casting is lost.
	The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side that functions as a portal.
	Any creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side faces in a different direction.

    <text>You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation, it doesn't need food or air and doesn't age.
	Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut-something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does-your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.
	Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
	The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.
	The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature's original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature's astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.
	If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.

    <text>By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:

	• Weal, for good results
	• Woe, for bad results
	• Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
	• Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad

The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.
	If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

    <text>After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. Your DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.
	The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.

Charmed:
	• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
	• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

    <text>You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:

	• Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.

	• While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

	• While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.

	• While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.

A remove curse spell ends this effect. At the DM's option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The DM has final say on such a curse's effect.

At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn't require concentration.

    <text>You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell's duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.
	The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (8) and a Dexterity of 10 (0). The hand doesn't fill its space.
	When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.

Clenched Fist: The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.

Forceful Hand: The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.

Grasping Hand: The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

Interposing Hand: The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand's Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand's space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.

    <text>Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
	If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.
	If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

    <text>Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.
	While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can't see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren't there can't perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.

    <text>A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate the cloud).
	When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.
	If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.

If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.
	You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.
	Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.

    <text>You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it can't be attacked or otherwise interacted with.
	When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.
	A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.

    <text>This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living, Medium creature as a safeguard against death. This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.
	At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return. The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original's equipment. The original creature's physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can't thereafter be restored to life, since the creature's soul is elsewhere.

    <text>You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.
	When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.
	The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

    <text>A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can't see).
	Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

    <text>You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.
	Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the spell ends.

Approach: The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

Drop: The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

Flee: The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

Grovel: The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

Halt: The target doesn't move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

	Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.
	If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.

In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn't function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.
	You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:

	• terrain and bodies of water
	• prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples
	• powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead
	• influence from other planes of existence
	• buildings

For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.

	The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.

On a failed save, a target is affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each affected target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn. It can take its action before it moves. After moving in this way, it can make another Wisdom saving throw to try to end the effect.
	A target isn't compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the designated direction.

    <text>This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.
	An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

Confusion Behaviour:
d10 | Behavior
1 | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn.
2-6 | The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.
7-8 | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.
9-10 | The creature can act and move normally.

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.

    <text>You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speak only in gibberish. A greater restoration spell cast on you ends this effect.
	On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The DM answers each question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.

    <text>Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target is poisoned.
	At the end of each of the poisoned target's turns, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target succeeds on three of these saves, it is no longer poisoned, and the spell ends. If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no longer poisoned, but choose one of the diseases below. The target is subjected to the chosen disease for the spell's duration.
	Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects apply to it.

Blinding Sickness: Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.

Filth Fever: A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.

Flesh Rot: The creature's flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.

Mindfire: The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the confusion spell during combat.

Seizure: The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.

Slimy Doom: The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

Stunned:
	• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.
	• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

Poisoned:
	• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on Attack rolls and Ability Checks.

    <text>Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a contingency cast with water breathing might stipulate that water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.
	The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then contingency ends.
	The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.

    <text>Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

Flood: You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.
	If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.
	The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.

Part Water: You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.

Redirect Flow: You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.

Whirlpool: This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.
	When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.
	The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

	As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
	The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghoul. When you cast this spell using an 8th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghoul or two ghast or wight. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over six ghoul, three ghast or wight, or two mummy.

    <text>You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.
	The duration depends on the object's material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.

Creation:
Material | Duration
Vegetable matter | 1 day
Stone or crystal | 12 hours
Precious metals | 1 hour
Gems | 10 minutes
Adamantine or mithral | 1 minute

Using any material created by this spell as another spell's material component causes that spell to fail.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.

    <text>One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the target is charmed in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and a madness glows in its eyes.
	The charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach.
	On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends. Also, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.

Charmed:
	• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
	• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

    <text>A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	The spell's base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.
	If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.
	The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.

When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.
	Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.

    <text>For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.
	You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.
	Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.
	You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.
	Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.

    <text>You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight downward" or "upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet."
	You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.
	If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.

    <text>You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
	The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
	To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

    <text>A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by wall of force.
	A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points.
	A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.
	This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.

    <text>Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
	You can end the spell early by using either of the following special functions.

Break Enchantment: As your action, you touch a creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.

Dismissal: As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if it isn't there already). If they aren't on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild.

The creature doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.

	The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.
	If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

    <text>You utter a divine word, imbued with the power that shaped the world at the dawn of creation. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each creature that can hear you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:

	• 50 hit points or fewer: deafened for 1 minute
	• 40 hit points or fewer: deafened and blinded for 10 minutes
	• 30 hit points or fewer: blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour
	• 20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly

Regardless of its current hit points, a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend that fails its save is forced back to its plane of origin (if it isn't there already) and can't return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a wish spell.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

Deafened:
	• A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

Stunned:
	• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.
	• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

    <text>You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.
	While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
	You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.
	Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell with a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

Charmed:
	• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
	• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

    <text>This spell shapes a creature's dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, can't be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can't take actions or move.
	If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target's dreams.
	You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target's sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.
	If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target's body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.

    <text>Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:

	• You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.

	• You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.

	• You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.

	• You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.

    <text>You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.
	The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.
	When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.
	This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.

Fissures: Fissures open throughout the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).

Structures: The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

    <text>You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.
	If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.

Enlarge: The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.

Reduce: The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).

One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for the duration. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to target another creature but can't target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of eyebite.

Asleep:
	• The target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.

Panicked:
	• The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.

Sickened:
	• The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.

Frightened:
	• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
	• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

Unconscious:
	• An unconscious creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
	• The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.
	• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
	• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

    <text>You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened for the duration.
	While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

	On a failed save, the creature's Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can't cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them.
	At the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving throw against this spell. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the spell ends.
	The spell can also be ended by greater restoration, heal, or wish.

    <text>You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable from death.
	For the spell's duration, or until you use an action to touch the target and dismiss the spell, the target appears dead to all outward inspection and to spells used to determine the target's status. The target is blinded and incapacitated, and its speed drops to 0. The target has resistance to all damage except psychic damage. If the target is diseased or poisoned when you cast the spell, or becomes diseased or poisoned while under the spell's effect, the disease and poison have no effect until the spell ends.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

Incapacitated:
	• An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.

    <text>You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.
	Additional animal form choices may be available at the DM's discretion.
	Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
	When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.
	While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deafened and blinded with regard to your own senses.
	As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.
	You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.
	Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

    <text>You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your DM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.
	Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.
	When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.
	While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with each other telepathically.
	You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.

    <text>This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn't specific (such as "a green dragon's lair"), the spell fails.
	For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.

    <text>You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
	This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.

	A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.
	If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.
	If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.

Petrified:
	• A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.
	• The creature is incapacitated (meaning it can't take actions or reactions), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
	• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	• The creature has resistance to all damage.
	• The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

    <text>You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can't teleport into the area or use portals, such as those created by the gate spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the plane shift spell.
	In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).
	When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.
	The spell's area can't overlap with the area of another forbiddance spell. If you cast forbiddance every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.

    <text>An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box as you choose.
	A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.
	A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.
	When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.
	A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
	This spell can't be dispelled by dispel magic.

	While in this form, the target's only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can't fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.
	While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can't attack or cast spells.

    <text>You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.
	The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.
	Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.
	When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn't work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature's immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.

    <text>You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.
	You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.
	You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.

Charmed:
	• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
	• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

	Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The DM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.

    <text>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
	The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.
	You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
	You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.
	When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.

Explosive Runes: When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.

Spell Glyph: You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

    <text>You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.
	When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.
	Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.

Corridors: Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.

Doors: All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the minor illusion spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.

Stairs: Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.

Other Spell Effect: You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.

	• Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.
	• Place magic mouth in two locations.
	• Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards lasts.
	• Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room. Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.

The whole warded area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.
	You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.

	Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.

    <text>You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a hallow spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.
	First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can't enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.
	Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the DM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.

Courage: Affected creatures can't be frightened while in the area.

Darkness: Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can't illuminate the area.

Daylight: Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell can't extinguish the light.

Energy Protection: Affected creatures in the area have resistance to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

Energy Vulnerability: Affected creatures in the area have vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

Everlasting Rest: Dead bodies interred in the area can't be turned into undead.

Extradimensional Interference: Affected creatures can't move or travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.

Fear: Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.

Silence: No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it.

Tongues: Affected creatures can communicate with any other creature in the area, even if they don't share a common language.

    <text>You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.
	The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

    <text>Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.
	If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

    <text>You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target.
	When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.

Burial: The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.
	The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.

Chaining: Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then.
	The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.

Hedged Prison: The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.
	The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.

Minimus Containment: The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.
	The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.

Slumber: The target falls asleep and can't be awoken.
	The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.

Ending the Spell: During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.
	A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.
	You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

    <text>A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.
	When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
	The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your turns.

    <text>A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

Invisible:
	• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.

    <text>Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn't of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.
	The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: "Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Rudnogg on the lips."

    <text>You hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).
	While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.
	After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell's effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.

The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.
	The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

    <text>Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature's location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.
	The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature.
	This spell can't locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.

    <text>You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.
	Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:

	• The creature can't willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.

	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.

	• Targets within the cylinder can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.

When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.

    <text>Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell's material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container's space. You can't move or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.
	You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a protection from evil and good or magic circle spell can't be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target's body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.
	Once you possess a creature's body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class levels, you can't use any of its class features.
	Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can't move or take actions at all.
	While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to its body. If the host body dies while you're in it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.
	If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.
	When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

    <text>You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.
	When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.
	The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

    <text>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte stench).
	As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.
	Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.

Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.
	Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
	You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn't met before the spell ends, the activity isn't performed.
	If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.

    <text>You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.
	While merged with the stone, you can't see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can't move.
	Minor physical damage to the stone doesn't harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone's complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

    <text>A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

    <text>This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

    <text>You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
	You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell.

    <text>You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.
	If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.
	If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.
	If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

    <text>You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain's general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.
	Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
	The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area disappears immediately.
	Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

    <text>Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.
	Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.
	If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
	A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
	A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

    <text>You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.
	You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.
	You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

Deafened:
	• A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

Invisible:
	• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.

    <text>You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target's memories are modified.
	While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.
	You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.
	A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.
	A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.

At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).

Charmed:
	• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
	• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

	A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.

When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.
	At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound's attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.

The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.
	Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
	You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can't exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can't leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.

    <text>You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.
	When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:

	• Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
	• The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.
	• Sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
	• Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination spells.
	• Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
	• Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.

	This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.
	Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

    <text>You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn't being carried or worn by another creature.
	When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.

False Aura: You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.

Mask: You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin's Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.

    <text>A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.
	If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.
	You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it explodes.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

    <text>A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.
	Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.
	The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.
	A disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

	A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends.

    <text>You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
	The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.
	The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.
	While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.
	An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

    <text>A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.
	For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.

    <text>You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).
	When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.
	Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.
	As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.
	After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.
	A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.

    <text>With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.
	A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.

You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM's discretion.
	Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.
	You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.

    <text>This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.
	If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.
	You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.
	If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

    <text>This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.
	The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.
	The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.
	The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
	The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

    <text>This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

	• You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.

	• You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.

	• You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.

	• You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.

	• You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.

	• You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

    <text>Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.

d8 | Power
1 | Red: The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
2 | Orange: The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
3 | Yellow: The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
4 | Green: The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
5 | Blue: The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
6 | Indigo: On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive, keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.
7 | Violet: On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the DM's choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)
8 | Special: The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

Petrified:
	• A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.
	• The creature is incapacitated (meaning it can't take actions or reactions), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
	• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	• The creature has resistance to all damage.
	• The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

    <classes>School: Abjuration, Wizard, Bard</classes>
    <text>A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.
	The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.
	The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described below.
	The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. An antimagic field has no effect on a prismatic wall.

Red: The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.

Orange: The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.

Yellow: The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.

Green: The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.

Blue: The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.

Indigo: On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.
	While this layer is in place, spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.

Violet: On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

Petrified:
	• A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.
	• The creature is incapacitated (meaning it can't take actions or reactions), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.

	• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	• The creature has resistance to all damage.
	• The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

    <text>A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.
	You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

Cantrip Upgrade: This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

    <text>You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.
	When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.
	The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.
	Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.
	You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.
	You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

    <text>You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature's soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.
	This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can't return an undead creature to life.
	This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.
	Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

    <text>You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren't affected by this spell.
	Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can't extend to other planes of existence.

    <text>You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.
	The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature's race to change. The DM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the DM chooses a form.

Reincarnate Races:
d100 | Race
1-4 | Dragonborn
5-13 | dwarf (hill)
14-21 | dwarf (mountain)
22-25 | elf (drow)
26-34 | elf (high)
35-42 | elf (wood)
43-46 | gnome (forest)
47-52 | gnome (rock)
53-56 | Half-elf
57-60 | Half-orc
61-68 | halfling (lightfoot)
69-76 | halfling (stout)
77-96 | Human
97-0 | Tiefling

The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly.

    <text>You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that didn't die of old age, and that isn't undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.
	This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren't removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.
	This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.
	Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
	Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you can't cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

    <text>This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.
	If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.
	At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.

	The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.
	Attacks and spells can't cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope.
	Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.

    <text>You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you're casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.

Knowledge of Target:
Knowledge | Save Modifier
Secondhand (you have heard of the target) | +5
Firsthand (you have met the target) | +0
Familiar (you know the target well) | -5

Connection to Target:
Connection | Save Modifier
Likeness or picture | -2
Possession or garment | -4
Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like | -10

On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this spell against it again for 24 hours.
	On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.
	Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.

    <text>This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.
	The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.
	The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
	A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

    <text>You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.
	You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive.

    <text>By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes invisible and can't be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells.
	If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn't grow older.
	You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the tarrasque awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.

Invisible:
	• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.

    <text>You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can't be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.
	Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus in place of yours. You can't use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.
	You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
	You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can't use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.
	When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.
	During this spell's duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.

    <text>A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.
	A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

    <text>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.
	You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
	Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

    <text>You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature's hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that it is a construct.
	The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.
	If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.
	If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.

    <text>This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).
	Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.
	Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected by this spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.

	The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.
	If a creature starts its turn in the spell's area and is concentrating on a spell, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

    <text>You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.
	An affected target's speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.
	If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.
	A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.

    <text>You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the DM's discretion.

    <text>You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can't be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.
	Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.

    <text>You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell's area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.
	You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.
	Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM's discretion. The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.
	If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.
	This spell can cause the plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.

	The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.

Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.
	Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces different effects on your turn.

Round 2: Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.

Round 3: You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can't be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Round 4: Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

Round 5-10: Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical.

Deafened:
	• A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.
	The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
	You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.

    <text>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
	The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.
	You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.
	You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.
	When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

Death: Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

Discord: Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

Fear: Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.

Hopelessness: Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.

Insanity: Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, which is erratic.

Pain: Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.

Sleep: Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.

Stunning: Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.

    <text>A creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if this spell affects it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for the duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn't affected.
	At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if it's triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends.

Incapacitated:
	• An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

    <text>You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.

Creature: You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature's Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.
	On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.

Object: You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.
	If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature's Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.
	You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

    <text>This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.
	The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults the table.

Teleportation:
Familiarity | Mishap | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target
Permanent circle | | | | | | | 01-100
Associated object | | | | | | | 01-100
Very familiar | 01-05 | 06-13 | 14-24 | 25-100

Description | 01-43 | 44-53 | 54-73 | 74-100
False destination | 01-50 | 51-100 | | | —

Familiarity: "Permanent circle" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. "Associated object" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.
	"Very familiar" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. "Seen casually" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.
	"False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.

On Target: You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.

Off Target: You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.

Similar Area: You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.

Mishap: The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

    <text>As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
	Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.
	You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.

    <text>This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.
	The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.
	If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

    <text>Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into a nonmagical object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.
	This spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn't affected by this spell.

Creature into Creature: If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or its level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.
	The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.
	The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech unless its new form is capable of such actions.
	The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

Object into Creature: You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature's size is no larger than the object's size and the creature's challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The DM has the creature's statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.
	If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.

Creature into Object: If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the object's size is no larger than the creature's size. The creature's statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.

    <text>You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature's soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.
	This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature was undead, it is restored to its non-undead form.
	The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature's name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.

    <text>A wall of water springs into existence at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 300 feet long, 300 feet high, and 50 feet thick. The wall lasts for the duration.
	When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
	At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 5d10 bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn, the wall's height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage creatures take from the spell on subsequent rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends.
	A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC in order to move at all. If it fails the check, it can't move. A creature that moves out of the area falls to the ground.

    <text>This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.
	Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.
	If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

    <text>An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).
	Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by dispel magic. A disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.

    <text>You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.
	If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
	The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.

    <text>A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.
	If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.
	The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.
	If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.
	The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.
	If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

	When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
	A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.
	Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.
	A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.
	The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

    <text>Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can't move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.
	If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.

	When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can't pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can't pass through it.

    <text>Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.
	The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:

	• You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.

	• You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.

	• You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.

	• You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.

	• You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.

You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.
	The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.

    <text>You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.
	The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

    <text>Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out a target. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the arrow disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.

    <text>You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
	If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.
	If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) against the spell's save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two additional pillars for each slot level above 6th.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

Atonement: You touch one willing creature whose alignment has changed, and you make a DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a successful check, you restore the target to its original alignment.

Bless Water: You touch one vial of water and cause it to become Holy Water (flask).

Coming of Age: You touch one humanoid who is a young adult. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes an ability check, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.

Dedication: You touch one humanoid who wishes to be dedicated to your god's service. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes a saving throw, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the save. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.

Funeral Rite: You touch one corpse, and for the next 7 days, the target can't become undead by any means short of a wish spell.

Wedding: You touch adult humanoids willing to be bonded together in marriage. For the next 7 days, each target gains a +2 bonus to AC while they are within 30 feet of each other. A creature can benefit from this rite again only if widowed.

    <text>You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.

Chaos Bolt:
d8 | Damage Type
1 | Acid
2 | Cold
3 | Fire
4 | Force
5 | Lightning
6 | Poison
7 | Psychic
8 | Thunder

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.
	A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.

    <text>You take control of the air in a 100-foot cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following effects when you cast the spell. The effect lasts for the spell's duration, unless you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you've halted.

Gusts: A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction you designate. You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that pass through it or that are made against targets within the cube have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.

Downdraft: You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a Strength saving throw if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

Updraft: You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube's bottom side. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can spend up to half your Hit Dice if the homunculus is on the same plane of existence as you. When you do so, roll each die and add your Constitution modifier to it. Your hit point maximum is reduced by the total, and the homunculus's hit point maximum and current hit points are both increased by it. This process can reduce you to no lower than 1 hit point, and the change to your and the homunculus's hit points ends when you finish your next long rest. The reduction to your hit point maximum can't be removed by any means before then, except by the homunculus's death.
	You can have only one homunculus at a time. If you cast this spell while your homunculus lives, the spell fails.

    <text>Seven star-like motes of light appear and orbit your head until the spell ends. You can use a bonus action to send one of the motes streaking toward one creature or object within 120 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, the mote is expended. The spell ends early if you expend the last mote.
	If you have four or more motes remaining, they shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. If you have one to three motes remaining, they shed dim light in a 30-foot radius.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the number of motes created increases by two for each slot level above 7th.

    <text>Threads of dark power leap from your fingers to pierce up to five Small or Medium corpses you can see within range. Each corpse immediately stands up and becomes undead. You decide whether it is a zombie or a skeleton (the statistics for zombies and skeletons are in the Monster Manual), and it gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
	You can use a bonus action to mentally command the creatures you make with this spell, issuing the same command to all of them. To receive the command, a creature must be within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the creatures will take and where they will move during their next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a chamber or passageway against your foes. If you issue no commands, the creatures do nothing except defend themselves against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creatures continue to follow it until their task is complete.
	The creatures are under your control until the spell ends, after which they become inanimate once more.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you animate up to two additional corpses for each slot level above 5th.

    <text>You invoke the spirits of nature to protect an area outdoors or underground. The area can be as small as a 30-foot cube or as large as a 90-foot cube. Buildings and other structures are excluded from the affected area. If you cast this spell in the same area every day for a year, the spell lasts until dispelled.
	The spell creates the following effects within the area. When you cast this spell, you can specify creatures as friends who are immune to the effects. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.
	The entire warded area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast on the area, if successful, removes only one of the following effects, not the entire area. That spell's caster chooses which effect to end. Only when all its effects are gone is this spell dispelled.

Solid Fog: You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground with thick fog, making them heavily obscured. The fog reaches 10 feet high. In addition, every foot of movement through the fog costs 2 extra feet. To a creature immune to this effect, the fog obscures nothing and looks like soft mist, with motes of green light floating in the air.

Grasping Undergrowth: You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground that aren't filled with fog with grasping weeds and vines, as if they were affected by an entangle spell. To a creature immune to this effect, the weeds and vines feel soft and reshape themselves to serve as temporary seats or beds.

Grove Guardians: You can animate up to four trees in the area, causing them to uproot themselves from the ground. These trees have the same statistics as an awakened tree, which appears in the Monster Manual, except they can't speak, and their bark is covered with druidic symbols. If any creature not immune to this effect enters the warded area, the grove guardians fight until they have driven off or slain the intruders. The grove guardians also obey your spoken commands (no action required by you) that you issue while in the area. If you don't give them commands and no intruders are present, the grove guardians do nothing. The grove guardians can't leave the warded area. When the spell ends, the magic animating them disappears, and the trees take root again if possible.

Additional Spell Effect: You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area:

	• A constant gust of wind in two locations of your choice
	• Spike growth in one location of your choice
	• Wind wall in two locations of your choice

To a creature immune to this effect, the winds are a fragrant, gentle breeze, and the area of spike growth is harmless.

	Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the dust devil must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the dust devil. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
	As a bonus action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet in any direction. If the dust devil moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or light gravel, it sucks up the material and forms a 10-foot-radius cloud of debris around itself that lasts until the start of your next turn. The cloud heavily obscures its area.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
	Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, spell, or other ability it's using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.

    <text>You seize the air and compel it to create one of the following effects at a point you can see within range:

	• One Medium or smaller creature that you choose must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 5 feet away from you.

	• You create a small blast of air capable of moving one object that is neither held nor carried and that weighs no more than 5 pounds. The object is pushed up to 10 feet away from you. It isn't pushed with enough force to cause damage.

	• You create a harmless sensory effect using air, such as causing leaves to rustle, wind to slam shutters closed, or your clothing to ripple in a breeze.

    <text>You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).
	Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore 1d6 hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can't heal constructs or undead. The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the spirit disappears.
	As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage on a hit. If the weapon isn't already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.
	As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded. At the end of each of its turns, a blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

    <text>By gathering threads of shadow material from the Shadowfell, you create a Huge shadowy dragon in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The illusion lasts for the spell's duration and occupies its space, as if it were a creature.
	When the illusion appears, any of your enemies that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute. If a frightened creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to the illusion, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 60 feet. At any point during its movement, you can cause it to exhale a blast of energy in a 60-foot cone originating from its space. When you create the dragon, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or poison. Each creature in the cone must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 7d6 damage of the chosen damage type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	The illusion is tangible because of the shadow stuff used to create it, but attacks miss it automatically, it succeeds on all saving throws, and it is immune to all damage and conditions. A creature that uses an action to examine the dragon can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it and has advantage on saving throws against its breath.

    <text>Uttering a dark incantation, you summon a devil from the Nine Hells. You choose the devil's type, which must be one of challenge rating 6 or lower, such as a barbed devil or a bearded devil. The devil appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The devil disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
	The devil is unfriendly toward you and your companions. Roll initiative for the devil, which has its own turns. It is under the Dungeon Master's control and acts according to its nature on each of its turns, which might result in its attacking you if it thinks it can prevail, or trying to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange for limited service. The DM has the creature's statistics.
	On each of your turns, you can try to issue a verbal command to the devil (no action required by you). It obeys the command if the likely outcome is in accordance with its desires, especially if the result would draw you toward evil. Otherwise, you must make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check contested by its Wisdom (Insight) check. You make the check with advantage if you say the devil's true name. If your check fails, the devil becomes immune to your verbal commands for the duration of the spell, though it can still carry out your commands if it chooses. If your check succeeds, the devil carries out your command—such as "attack my enemies," "explore the room ahead," or "bear this message to the queen"—until it completes the activity, at which point it returns to you to report having done so.
	If your concentration ends before the spell reaches its full duration, the devil doesn't disappear if it has become immune to your verbal commands. Instead, it acts in whatever manner it chooses for 3d6 minutes, and then it disappears.
	If you possess an individual devil's talisman, you can summon that devil if it is of the appropriate challenge rating plus 1, and it obeys all your commands, with no Charisma checks required.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.

	• You can use your action to create a small earthquake on the ground in a 15-foot radius centered on you. Other creatures on that ground must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

You can move through solid earth or stone as if it was air and without destabilizing it, but you can't end your movement there.

Prone:
	•  A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

	• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.
	• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

    <text>You transform up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to resist the transformation. An unwilling shapechanger automatically succeeds on the save.
	Each target assumes a beast form of your choice, and you can choose the same form or different ones for each target. The new form can be any beast you have seen whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or half the target's level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, but the target retains its hit points, alignment, and personality.
	Each target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the hit points of its new form. These temporary hit points can't be replaced by temporary hit points from another source. A target reverts to its normal form when it has no more temporary hit points or it dies. If the spell ends before then, the creature loses all its temporary hit points and reverts to its normal form.
	The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form. It can't speak, cast spells, or do anything else that requires hands or speech.
	The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

    <text>You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the spell's duration.
	As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	To break out, the restrained target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.
	As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

    <text>You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration. When you cast the spell—and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter—you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.

    <text>You attempt to bind a creature within an illusory cell that only it perceives. One creature you can see within range must make an Intelligence saving throw. The target succeeds automatically if it is immune to being charmed. On a successful save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and the spell ends. On a failed save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and you make the area immediately around the target's space appear dangerous to it in some way. You might cause the target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws filled with dripping teeth.

    <text>A fortress of stone erupts from a square area of ground of your choice that you can see within range. The area is 120 feet on each side, and it must not have any buildings or other structures on it. Any creatures in the area are harmlessly lifted up as the fortress rises.
	The fortress has four turrets with square bases, each one 20 feet on a side and 30 feet tall, with one turret on each corner. The turrets are connected to each other by stone walls that are each 80 feet long, creating an enclosed area. Each wall is 1 foot thick and is composed of panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Each panel is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel and a turret. You can place up to four stone doors in the fortress's outer wall.
	A small keep stands inside the enclosed area. The keep has a square base that is 50 feet on each side, and it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can have stone doors or open archways as you choose. The keep is furnished and decorated however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people each day. Furnishings, food, and other objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed from the fortress.
	A staff of one hundred invisible servants obeys any command given to them by creatures you designate when you cast the spell. Each servant functions as if created by the unseen servant spell.
	The walls, turrets, and keep are all made of stone that can be damaged. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of stone has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. It is immune to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a section of stone to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the DM's discretion.
	After 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere else, the fortress harmlessly crumbles and sinks back into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it safely on the ground.
	Casting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days for a year makes the fortress permanent.

    <text>You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

	• If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn't involve enough force to cause damage.

	• You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.

	• If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.

	While the target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.
	A target suffering this pain can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the pain ends.

    <text>As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.
	This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.
	The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell's radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends.
	A restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends.
	After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is restrained by it.

Restrained:

    <text>This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and traps it inside the tiny cage you use for the material component. A stolen soul remains inside the cage until the spell ends or until you destroy the cage, which ends the spell. While you have a soul inside the cage, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a trapped soul up to six times. Once you exploit a soul for the sixth time, it is released, and the spell ends. While a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid it came from can't be revived.

Steal Life: You can use a bonus action to drain vigor from the soul and regain 2d8 hit points.

Query Soul: You ask the soul a question (no action required) and receive a brief telepathic answer, which you can understand regardless of the language used. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.

Borrow Experience: You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself with the soul's life experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don't use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.

Eyes of the Dead: You can use an action to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of existence you're currently on. The sensor remains for as long as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you were concentrating on a spell). You receive visual and auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using your senses.
	A creature that can see the sensor (such as one using see invisibility or truesight) sees a translucent image of the tormented humanoid whose soul you caged.

    <text>A 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence, centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell's duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The sphere's space is difficult terrain.
	Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center.

    <text>You utter foul words, summoning one demon from the chaos of the Abyss. You choose the demon's type, which must be one of challenge rating 5 or lower, such as a shadow demon or a barlgura. The demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range, and the demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
	Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns. When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter, you can issue a verbal command to it (requiring no action on your part), telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn attacking any creature within reach that has attacked it.
	At the end of each of the demon's turns, it makes a Charisma saving throw. The demon has disadvantage on this saving throw if you say its true name. On a failed save, the demon continues to obey you. On a successful save, your control of the demon ends for the rest of the duration, and the demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons to the best of its ability. If you stop concentrating on the spell before it reaches its full duration, an uncontrolled demon doesn't disappear for 1d6 rounds if it still has hit points.
	As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with the blood used as a material component. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demon can't cross the circle or harm it, and it can't target anyone within it. Using the material component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 4th.

The DM chooses the demons, such as manes or dretch, and you choose the unoccupied spaces you can see within range where they appear. A summoned demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
	The demons are hostile to all creatures, including you. Roll initiative for the summoned demons as a group, which has its own turns. The demons pursue and attack the nearest non-demons to the best of their ability.
	As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with the blood used as a material component. The circle is large enough to encompass your space.

    <text>You cause a temple to shimmer into existence on ground you can see within range. The temple must fit within an unoccupied cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side. The temple remains until the spell ends. It is dedicated to whatever god, pantheon, or philosophy is represented by the holy symbol used in the casting.
	You make all decisions about the temple's appearance. The interior is enclosed by a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting access to the interior and as many windows as you wish. Only you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the door.
	The temple's interior is an open space with an idol or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light. The smell of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.
The temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can't enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.
	In addition, the sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the temple, and creatures within can't be targeted by divination spells.
	Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 hit point).
	The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple's interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple's exterior. It can't be dispelled by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it. A disintegrate spell destroys the temple instantly.
	Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

	As a bonus action, you can mentally command the creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures with this spell, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a key, stand watch, or stack some books. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete.
	When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 3rd.

    <text>You choose an area of stone or mud that you can see that fits within a 40-foot cube and is within range, and choose one of the following effects.

Transmute Rock to Mud: Nonmagical rock of any sort in the area becomes an equal volume of thick, flowing mud that remains for the spell's duration.
	The ground in the spell's area becomes muddy enough that creatures can sink into it. Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is restrained, though it can use an action to end the restrained condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud.
	If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Transmute Mud to Rock: Nonmagical mud or quicksand in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms into soft stone for the spell's duration. Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface in an unoccupied space. On a failed save, a creature becomes restrained by the rock. A restrained creature, or another creature within reach, can use an action to try to break the rock by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing damage to it. The rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

    <text>You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot-diameter ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and another 5d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.

    <text>A shimmering wall of bright light appears at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can be free floating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight, but creatures and objects can pass through it. It emits bright light out to 120 feet and dim light for an additional 120 feet.
	When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded. A blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
	A creature that ends its turn in the wall's area takes 4d8 radiant damage.
	Until the spell ends, you can use an action to launch a beam of radiance from the wall at one creature you can see within 60 feet of it. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, reduce the length of the wall by 10 feet. If the wall's length drops to 0 feet, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

    <text>You create a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall's space is difficult terrain.
	Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot-square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall's water doesn't fill it.

    <text>You conjure up a sphere of water with a 5-foot radius at a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell's duration.
	Any creature in the sphere's space must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space of the creature's choice outside the sphere. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically, and a Large or smaller creature can choose to fail it. On a failed save, a creature is restrained by the sphere and is engulfed by the water. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
	The sphere can restrain as many as four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature that causes it to exceed this capacity, a random creature that was already restrained by the sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 5 feet of it.
	As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, a cliff, or other drop-off, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet above the ground. Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the saving throw.
	When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone in the space where it falls. The water then vanishes.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

    <text>A whirlwind howls down to a point that you can see on the ground within range. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Until the spell ends, you can use your action to move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone.
	A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirlwind first appears. A creature takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the spell ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top. A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the spell ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft.
	A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d6 × 10 feet away from it in a random direction.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

Trees: At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 slashing damage from whipping branches.

Roots and Vines: At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the spell ends.

It carries an open, empty chest whose interior dimensions are 3 feet on each side. While the spell lasts, you can deposit as many items inside the chest as will fit. You can then name a living creature you have met and seen at least once before, or any creature for which you possess a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the creature's body.
	As soon as the lid of the chest is closed, the elemental and the chest disappear, then reappear adjacent to the target creature. If the target creature is on another plane, or if it is proofed against magical detection or location, the contents of the chest reappear on the ground at your feet.
	The target creature is made aware of the chest's contents before it chooses whether or not to open it, and knows how much of the spell's duration remains in which it can retrieve them. No other creature can open the chest and retrieve its contents. When the spell expires or when all the contents of the chest have been removed, the elemental and the chest disappear. The elemental also disappears if the target creature orders it to return the items to you. When the elemental disappears, any items not taken from the chest reappear on the ground at your feet.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using an 8th-level spell slot, you can send the chest to a creature on a different plane of existence from you.

    <text>You conjure a two-story tower made of stone, wood, or similar suitably sturdy materials. The tower can be round or square in shape. Each level of the tower is 10 feet tall and has an area of up to 100 square feet. Access between levels consists of a simple ladder and hatch. Each level takes one of the following forms, chosen by you when you cast the spell:

	• A bedroom with a bed, chairs, chest, and magical fireplace
	• A study with desks, books, bookshelves, parchments, ink, and ink pens
	• A dining space with a table, chairs, magical fireplace, containers, and cooking utensils
	• A lounge with couches, armchairs, side tables and footstools
	• A washroom with toilets, washtubs, a magical brazier, and sauna benches
	• An observatory with a telescope and maps of the night sky
	• An unfurnished, empty room

The interior of the tower is warm and dry, regardless of conditions outside. Any equipment or furnishings conjured with the tower dissipate into smoke if removed from it. At the end of the spell's duration, all creatures and objects within the tower that were not created by the spell appear safely outside on the ground, and all traces of the tower and its furnishings disappear.
	You can cast this spell again while it is active to maintain the tower's existence for another 24 hours. You can create a permanent tower by casting this spell in the same location and with the same configuration every day for one year.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the tower can have one additional story for each slot level beyond 3rd.

While the creature is charmed in this way, it undertakes to perform any services or activities you ask of it in a friendly manner, to the best of its ability.
	You can set the creature new tasks when a previous task is completed, or if you decide to end its current task. If the service or activity might cause harm to the creature, or if it conflicts with the creature's normal activities and desires, the creature can make another Wisdom saving throw to try to end the effect. This save is made with advantage if you or your companions are fighting the creature. If the activity would result in certain death for the creature, the spell ends.
	When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

Charmed:
	• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
	• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the spell ends, or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. While charmed in this way, a creature can do nothing but use its movement to approach you in a safe manner. While an affected creature is within 5 feet of you, it cannot move, but simply stares greedily at the gem you present.
	At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

Charmed:
	• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
	• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

    <text>Of the many tactics employed by master magician and renowned adventurer Jim Darkmagic, the old glowing coin trick is a time-honored classic. When you cast the spell, you hurl the coin that is the spell's material component to any spot within range. The coin lights up as if under the effect of a light spell. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the coin must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be distracted for the duration. While distracted, a creature has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and initiative rolls.

    <text>"Jim's magic missile is an ancient and powerful spell, as well as being the name of my band in Wizard Academy."
- Jim Darkmagic

Any apprentice wizard can cast a boring old magic missile. Sure, it always strikes its target. Yawn. Do away with the drudgery of your grandfather's magic with this improved version of the spell, as used by Jim Darkmagic!
	You create three twisting, whistling, hypoallergenic, gluten-free darts of magical force. Each dart targets a creature of your choice that you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack for each missile. On a hit, a missile deals 2d4 force damage to its target.
	If the attack roll scores a critical hit, the target of that missile takes 5d4 force damage instead of you rolling damage twice for a critical hit. If the attack roll for any missile is a 1, all missiles miss their targets and blow up in your face, dealing 1 force damage per missile to you.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart, and the royalty component increases by 1 gp, for each slot level above 1st.

- Walnut Dankgrass

You address allies, staff, or innocent bystanders to exhort and inspire them to greatness, whether they have anything to get excited about or not. Choose up to five creatures within range that can hear you. For the duration, each affected creature gains 5 temporary hit points and has advantage on Wisdom saving throws. If an affected creature is hit by an attack, it has advantage on the next attack roll it makes. Once an affected creature loses the temporary hit points granted by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the temporary hit points increase by 5 for each slot level above 3rd.

The type of magen is chosen by you during the casting of the spell. See appendix C for different kinds of magen and their statistics.
	When the magen appears, your hit point maximum decreases by an amount equal to the magen's challenge rating (minimum reduction of 1). Only a wish spell can undo this reduction to your hit point maximum.
	Any magen you create with this spell obeys your commands without question.

Item: A suit of armor (requires attunement)

The wearer of this armor gains these benefits:

	• The wearer's walking speed increases by 5 feet.

	• The armor includes gauntlets, each of which is a magic melee weapon that can be wielded only when the hand is holding nothing. The wearer is proficient with the gauntlets, and each one deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the gauntlet detaches and flies at the attack's target, then immediately returns to the wearer and reattaches.

	• The armor can't be removed against the wearer's will.

	• If the wearer is missing any limbs, the armor replaces those limbs—hands, arms, feet, legs, or similar appendages. The replacements function identically to the body parts they replace.

You learn intricate methods for magically creating a special homunculus that serves you. The item you infuse serves as the creature's heart, around which the creature's body instantly forms.
	You determine the homunculus's appearance. Some artificers prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.
	The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.
	In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
	The homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it. If you or the homunculus dies, it vanishes, leaving its heart in its space.

Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

    <text>You and up to eight willing creatures within range fall unconscious for the spell's duration and experience visions of another world on the Material Plane, such as Oerth, Toril, Krynn, or Eberron. If the spell reaches its full duration, the visions conclude with each of you encountering and pulling back a mysterious blue curtain. The spell then ends with you mentally and physically transported to the world that was in the visions.
	To cast this spell, you must have a magic item that originated on the world you wish to reach, and you must be aware of the world's existence, even if you don't know the world's name. Your destination in the other world is a safe location within 1 mile of where the magic item was created. Alternatively, you can cast the spell if one of the affected creatures was born on the other world, which causes your destination to be a safe location within 1 mile of where that creature was born.
	The spell ends early on a creature if that creature takes any damage, and the creature isn't transported. If you take any damage, the spell ends for you and all the other creatures, with none of you being transported.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot above the 2nd, and the number of Hit Dice that can be spent and added to the healing roll increases by one for each slot above 2nd.

    <text>This spell creates a sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere can have a radius of up to 40 feet. The area within this sphere is filled with magical darkness and crushing gravitational force.
	For the duration, the spell's area is difficult terrain. A creature with darkvision can't see through the magical darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. No sound can be created within or pass through the area. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.
	Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 8d10 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust.

    <text>You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of destructive gravitational force centered on a point you can see within range. For the spell's duration, the sphere and any space within 100 feet of it are difficult terrain, and nonmagical objects fully inside the sphere are destroyed if they aren't being worn or carried.
	When the sphere appears and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends, unsecured objects within 100 feet of the sphere are pulled toward the sphere's center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible.
	A creature that starts its turn within 100 feet of the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled straight toward the sphere's center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible. A creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 5d10 force damage and is restrained until it is no longer in the sphere. If the sphere is in the air, the restrained creature hovers inside the sphere. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, ending this restrained condition on itself or another creature in the sphere that it can reach. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is annihilated, along with any nonmagical items it is wearing or carrying.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it can't take reactions until the spell ends. The affected target must also roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns; the number rolled determines what happens to the target, as shown on the Reality Break Effects table.
	At the end of each of its turns, the affected target can repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the spell on itself on a success.

Reality Break Effects:
d10 | Effect
1-2 | Vision of the Far Realm. The target takes 6d12 psychic damage, and it is stunned until the end of the turn.
3-5 | Rending Rift. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d12 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
6-8 | Wormhole. The target is teleported, along with everything it is wearing and carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see. The target also takes 10d12 force damage and is knocked prone.
9-10 | Chill of the Dark Void. The target takes 10d12 cold damage, and it is blinded until the end of the turn.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

Stunned:
	• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.
	• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

    <text>Two creatures you can see within range must make a Constitution saving throw, with disadvantage if they are within 30 feet of each other. Either creature can willingly fail the save. If either save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If both saves fail, the creatures are magically linked for the duration, regardless of the distance between them. When damage is dealt to one of them, the same damage is dealt to the other one. If hit points are restored to one of them, the same number of hit points are restored to the other one. If either of the tethered creatures is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends on both. If the spell ends on one creature, it ends on both.

The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the save fails, the target also ages to the point where it has only 30 days left before it dies of old age. In this aged state, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and its walking speed is halved. Only the wish spell or the greater restoration cast with a 9th-level spell slot can end these effects and restore the target to its previous age.

    <text>You channel the powers of the Primordials to animate a number of plants within range. These plants must be in an open and unoccupied space. If no space is available, then the GM may choose to have plants rapidly grow as a result of the spell. In this case the GM also chooses how many plants grow. Choose one of the following options for what appears:

	• One plant of challenge rating 2 or lower
	• Two plants of challenge rating 1 or lower
	• Four plants of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
	• Eight plants of challenge rating 1/4 or lower

Each plant is considered an elemental in addition to its other types, and it becomes a normal plant again when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The animated creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the animated creatures as a group, which has its own turns. The creatures obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you).
	If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. The GM has the creatures' statistics.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the animating options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with a 9th-level slot.

You can animate a number of large or smaller undead creatures equalling a total challenge rating 2 or lower.
	On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which time it stops obeying any command you've given it.
	To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over 1 creature you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one. Additionally, casting this spell in this manner does not require spell components with a GP cost.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can animate or reassert control of an additional CR worth of undead creatures created with this spell. When you cast this spell using a 9th level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over an additional two CR worth of undead creatures created with this spell. Additional creatures must be animated with sufficient corpses or bones.

    <text>This spell curses a creature on the same plane of existence as you with an obsessive selfinfatuation. The target must make a Charisma saving throw against the spell's DC, which is modified by the Curse Strength Table. On a successful save, the target becomes aware that somebody attempted to curse them. On a failed save, the target becomes cursed and is unaware of this. Upon the completion of this curse's triggering event, the target automatically advances to stage 1 of this curse.

Triggering event: The next time the cursed creature looks into a mirror or reflective surface, it spontaneously cracks.

Stage 1: The cursed creature is compelled to stop and admire themselves whenever they see their own reflection.

Stage 2: The cursed creature becomes obsessed with looking for and finding its own reflection wherever it goes. Additionally, the cursed creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.

Stage 3: The cursed creature is driven to find or, if necessary, build a location where it can see its own reflection from many angles. The cursed creature is compelled to remain in this location and admire itself. Additionally, attack rolls against the creature gain advantage.

Culmination: Upon failing the final escalation check, the cursed creature twists into a deformed figure and becomes a Weeping Willow. If the creature is a player character, they become an NPC under the GM's control.

Escalation: Escalation represents the curse gaining power as time goes on. At dawn once a day, a cursed creature must make an escalation check to see if their curse escalates. To pass, a creature needs to roll an unmodified d20, and obtain a score greater than the number of checks they have made on this stage. On a failed save, the cursed creature applies the effects of the next stage of the curse, in addition to any previous stages.
	For example, a creature who has just been cursed makes an escalation check the following dawn. They must roll greater than a 1. The next day the DC will increase to 2, and so on. If, on the 5th dawn, they roll a 5 or less, the curse escalates to the second stage. They apply any new effects and reset the DC to 1.

Curing: Once they have begun, curses are notoriously difficult to cure. Many adventurers have fallen to a curse before they were able to gather the components to cure it. As a result, it is not unheard of for traveling mystics to carry multiple curing ingredients with them, to sell for exorbitant prices.
	To cure a curse, a cursed creature must be targeted with the remove curse spell. In addition, a number of cure components are required equal to the number of stages their curse has escalated to. For example, a curse that has escalated to stage 3 requires 3 cure components as well as a remove curse spell.
	The following items outline a number of cure components that can be found within the world of Etharis. A GM can include additional components based on their setting, campaign story or game mechanic they wish to include.

	• Hag's promise. A potion brewed by hags, purposely named confusingly.

	• A strand of hair from the lost but not found. From a pillow or other possession of a lost person.

	• A twice-murdered raven. A raven that has been killed, resurrected, then killed again.

	• The highest pinecone of a forest. Found with a lot of climbing.

	• A clock which runs backwards. Casting slow and haste on a timepiece will cause it to tick backwards.

	• A black pearl, harvested but a week ago.

	• Found with a lot of swimming.

	• A book that has never been read. From a publisher or printing press.

	• A rose that grows in darkness but not sunlight. A rare flower known as a Black Rose.

	• A life willingly given. Someone willing to sacrifice themself to cure the cursed.

	• Wish. A wish granted by a spell or entity.

Triggering event: The next time the target changes clothing, they find multiple wrinkles, grey hairs and liver spots they did not previously have.

Stage 1: The cursed creature is compelled to rest when the occasion permits it, becoming lethargic and lazy.

Stage 2: The cursed creature becomes feeble as their muscle mass begins to deteriorate. The cursed creature has disadvantage on Strength saving throws.

Stage 3: The cursed creature starts to age rapidly, becoming decrepit. The cursed creature's Strength score becomes 6, unless it was already lower.

Culmination: Upon failing the final escalation check, the cursed creature twists into a deformed figure and becomes a Body Snatcher. If the creature is a player character, they become an NPC under the GM's control.

Escalation: Escalation represents the curse gaining power as time goes on. At dawn once a day, a cursed creature must make an escalation check to see if their curse escalates.

The target must make a Charisma saving throw against the spell's DC, which is modified by the Curse Strength Table. On a successful save, the target becomes aware that somebody attempted to curse them. On a failed save, the target becomes cursed and is unaware of this. Upon the completion of this curse's triggering event, the target automatically advances to stage 1 of this curse.

Triggering event: The target searches their backpack, clothes drawer, or wherever else they store their garments, they find an infestation of insects.

Stage 1: The cursed creature is afflicted with a minor cough. Whenever they speak more than a few words at a time, they break into a fit of coughing.

Stage 2: The smell of putrescence lingers in the air around the cursed creature. Food and drink quickly spoil, jewelry tarnishes, and wood rots within 10 feet of the cursed creature. Additionally, the cursed creature has disadvantage on Charisma saving throws.

Stage 3: The cursed creature's skin becomes riddled with pock marks, pustules, and lesions. Insects flock to the cursed creature, infesting their clothes. The cursed creature's Charisma score becomes 6, unless it was already lower.

Culmination: Upon failing the final escalation check, the cursed creature twists into a deformed figure and becomes a Plague Carrion. If the creature is a player character, they become an NPC under the GM's control.

Escalation: Escalation represents the curse gaining power as time goes on. At dawn once a day, a cursed creature must make an escalation check to see if their curse escalates. To pass, a creature needs to roll an unmodified d20, and obtain a score greater than the number of checks they have made on this stage. On a failed save, the cursed creature applies the effects of the next stage of the curse, in addition to any previous stages.
	For example, a creature who has just been cursed makes an escalation check the following dawn. They must roll greater than a 1. The next day the DC will increase to 2, and so on. If, on the 5th dawn, they roll a 5 or less, the curse escalates to the second stage. They apply any new effects and reset the DC to 1.

Curing: Once they have begun, curses are notoriously difficult to cure. Many adventurers have fallen to a curse before they were able to gather the components to cure it. As a result, it is not unheard of for traveling mystics to carry multiple curing ingredients with them, to sell for exorbitant prices.
	To cure a curse, a cursed creature must be targeted with the remove curse spell. In addition, a number of cure components are required equal to the number of stages their curse has escalated to. For example, a curse that has escalated to stage 3 requires 3 cure components as well as a remove curse spell.
	The following items outline a number of cure components that can be found within the world of Etharis. A GM can include additional components based on their setting, campaign story or game mechanic they wish to include.

	• Hag's promise. A potion brewed by hags, purposely named confusingly.

	• A strand of hair from the lost but not found. From a pillow or other possession of a lost person.

	• A twice-murdered raven. A raven that has been killed, resurrected, then killed again.

	• The highest pinecone of a forest. Found with a lot of climbing.

	• A clock which runs backwards. Casting slow and haste on a timepiece will cause it to tick backwards.

	• A black pearl, harvested but a week ago.

	• Found with a lot of swimming.

	• A book that has never been read. From a publisher or printing press.

	• A rose that grows in darkness but not sunlight. A rare flower known as a Black Rose.

	• A life willingly given. Someone willing to sacrifice themself to cure the cursed.

	• Wish. A wish granted by a spell or entity.

    <text>This spell curses a creature on the same plane of existence as you with lethal bad luck. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw against the spell's DC, which is modified by the Curse Strength Table. On a successful save, the target becomes aware that somebody attempted to curse them. On a failed save, the target becomes cursed and is unaware of this. Upon the completion of this curse's triggering event, the target automatically advances to stage 1 of this curse.

Triggering event: The next time the target walks through a doorway or up a flight of stairs, the target stubs their toe, bruising it badly.

Stage 1: The cursed creature falls victim to minor inconveniences and bad luck. Shops they wish to visit close just as they arrive, equipment breaks at inconvenient moments, and other unfortunate events befall them.

Stage 2: The cursed creature becomes a beacon of bad luck as otherwise harmless setbacks become increasingly dangerous. For example, objects constantly seem to be placed in their way. Additionally, the cursed creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

Stage 3: The cursed creature becomes dangerously accident-prone, as even the simplest tasks have unforeseen life-threatening consequences. The cursed creature's Dexterity score becomes 6, unless it was lower already.

Culmination: Upon failing the final escalation check, the cursed creature twists into a deformed figure and becomes a Herald of Calamity. If the creature is a player character, they become an NPC under the GM's control.

Escalation: Escalation represents the curse gaining power as time goes on. At dawn once a day, a cursed creature must make an escalation check to see if their curse escalates.

    <text>You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into wood. If the target's body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden into bark. On a successful save, the creature isn't affected.
	A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its Constitution saving throw three times, it is turned into a tree and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.
	If the transformed creature is burned, chopped down, or otherwise destroyed while petrified, the creature is slain.
	A creature remains transformed unless the effect is reversed within one year with greater restoration, wish, or similar magical effects. If the creature spends one year and a day as a tree, the transformation becomes permanent, and nothing can return the creature to its original form.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

Petrified:
	• A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.
	• The creature is incapacitated (meaning it can't take actions or reactions), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
	• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	• The creature has resistance to all damage.
	• The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

	Until the spell ends, you can attempt to recall any important fact known to the creature—family history, recent events, building layouts, passwords, details of the creature's death, and similar information. To recall a piece of information, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting modifier. The DC is equal to the corpse's Intelligence score.
	Once the caster rolls to determine whether they recall a fact, they cannot attempt to recall it again.

    <text>As part of casting this spell you must expend six hit dice or the spell automatically fails. When you do, blood flows from your body then crystallizes into a barbed arrow, which launches at a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the chosen creature. On a hit, roll the hit dice expended to cast this spell, and the creature takes piercing damage equal to the result.
	Once lodged in the creature, the bloody arrow begins to burrow toward its heart, rendering it vulnerable to further attacks. At the start of the creature's next turn, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, attacks against the creature score critical hits on a 19 or 20 on the attack roll.
	At the start of each of the creature's turns after that, it must repeat the Constitution saving throw or the critical hit range on attacks against the creature increases by 1 again. If the creature succeeds on three of these saving throws (these successes do not need to be consecutive) this spell ends. The increased critical hit range ends when the spell does.

    <text>A momentary bubble of iridescent energy shimmers in the air between you and the caster of the triggering spell. The spell is redirected to a creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet. If the spell is 5th level or lower, you are no longer a target of the spell and the chosen creature is instead. If the spell is 6th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, you are no longer a target of the spell and the chosen creature is instead. On a failed check, you remain the target of the triggering spell.

    <text>You create a pair of grasping hands made from invisible forces. Make a spell attack against one creature that you can see within range. On a hit, the creature is restrained as the hands crush their throat or bodily equivalent.
	If the creature requires air to breathe, it begins to suffocate. A suffocating creature can survive for a number of rounds equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn after those rounds are over, it becomes unconscious, and it can't regain hit points until it can breathe again.
	A conscious creature restrained by the hands can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

    <text>You channel primal predatory energies to perfectly conceal your presence in order to surprise your target. You become invisible for the spell's duration, granting advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks to remain hidden. The invisibility will last for the duration of the spell, however, moving 5 feet or more from your position when you cast the spell will end the effect.
	As long as you remain invisible, the first attack you make against any target who is unaware of your presence deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. This attack ends the spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot above 2nd level, the damage of your first attack increases by 1d6 for every slot level above 2nd.

Invisible:
	• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.

    <text>You transform your arms into powerful wings, and your fingers into long, graceful feathers. The effects of this spell last 1 minute, at which point the feathers gradually fall out, causing you to float gently to the ground as your arms return to their original form. This spell confers a number of benefits upon the caster:

	• As a bonus action, you can fly up to double your movement speed. You must land once you finish your movement, although you do not take fall damage while this spell is active, as your feathered arms bear you gently to the ground.

	• You can use your powerful feathered arms to propel yourself upward a distance equal to half your movement speed. You can do this once during your turn and may use it in conjunction with a regular jump.

	• When falling, you can use your reaction to stiffen your arms, and glide on the wind. You may fly up to your movement speed, in any direction, choosing where you land.

	• You gain advantage on all athletics checks used to make a long or high jump. You do not need to move 10 feet before you jump to gain distance, and you triple the distance you would jump normally.

In order to benefit from this spell your hands must be free of shields and heavy weapons, and you cannot be encumbered.

    <text>You shroud the area surrounding you in a sphere of night sky, dotted with miniature stars. The twilight conceals your allies, but clearly illuminates your enemies.
	The area affected by this spell is lightly obscured by magical shadow, within which small constellations softly twinkle. Aside from these stars, only light produced by a spell of 3rd level or higher can properly illuminate any area inside the sphere. Nonmagical light does not function inside the sphere, and all other forms of magical radiance can only produce dim light in a 5-foot space.
	When you cast this spell you may designate any number of creatures you can see to be concealed by the supernatural shadows while in the sphere. A concealed creature has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when inside the sphere and may attempt to hide at any time. Because the area of the spell is lightly obscured, creatures within the spell's area have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see those outside of it.
	All other creatures in the area are dazzled by the light of the miniature stars, causing them to have disadvantage on all perception checks inside the sphere. When such a creature enters the spell's area for the first time, or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the end of its turn.

    <text>You call upon the power of an Amaranthine to grant yourself insight into the Great Rhythm that moves all things. When you cast this spell, roll two d20s, and record what you rolled. For each die, choose either attack roll, skill check, or saving throw. You can choose each option multiple times. For the next 24 hours, you may substitute any roll of an ally or enemy you can see within 60 feet with one of the recorded numbers that matches the type of roll you wish to replace (attack roll, skill check, or saving throw). The target still adds any relevant modifiers to this number, but otherwise treat the substituted number as the number they rolled.
	To do this, you must spend a reaction to present your holy symbol and invoke the name of the Amaranthine whose energies you called upon. You can do this anytime after the skill check, saving throw or attack has been rolled, but before the outcome of the event has been determined. The spell ends after 24 hours have passed, or when both dice have been expended.

    <text>You call upon gentle natural magics to alter the growth of plants. Any plant life you can see within range that fits within a 5-foot cube can take on whatever shape you desire. Additionally, if the plant is a bramble or capable of growing thorns, you may turn the affected area into difficult terrain, causing 2d4 points of piercing damage for every 5 feet moved through the area you shaped. You may also increase or decrease the number of flowers, vines, leaves, thorns, branches, or fruits produced by any plant you shape.
	After one hour, the magic of your spell fades, and the plant resumes its normal shape. If you can use speak with plants (or a similar ability) to communicate with the plant, you may persuade it to retain its new form. Different plants have different feelings and attitudes, and if the form is too different from its natural shape it is likely to decline. If the plant accepts, at the GM's discretion, it will retain the form you have sculpted it into, in which case the effect becomes permanent.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot above 4th level, the size of the cube of plant life you can affect with the spell increases by an additional 5 feet for every slot level above 4th.

	Additionally, for the duration, you can place seals, burn them, and use interdict boons as if you were in the creature's space, but doing so makes the creature aware of this bond. An aware creature can use their action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effects of this boon on a success.

As an action, you can touch a creature and expend four seals to attempt to send that creature to Hell. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be pulled through a rift into the prisons of your archfiend's infernal city.
	If the target is native to Hell, or if their level or challenge rating is 4 or lower, they remain there and must find their own way out. Otherwise, the target remains in the prison for 1 minute, after which they reappear in the space they left or in the nearest unoccupied space available; this target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect early on a success.

When you are reduced to 0 hit points and have unplaced seals remaining, the hellfire in you refuses to die. You can expend up to 3 seals and release an explosion around you (no action required). Roll 3d6 per seal expended. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes fire damage equal to the total you rolled. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. If this explosion damages at least one creature, you regain a number of hit points equal to the total you rolled.

In addition, attacks made with the weapon deal an extra 2d6 necrotic damage on a hit. If the weapon isn't already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.
	As a bonus action on your turn while holding this weapon, you can end the spell early and cause the weapon to emit a burst of dark energy. Each creature of your choice who you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 necrotic damage and is frightened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened. At the end of each of their turns, a frightened creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on themself on a success.

Frightened:
	• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
	• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

Octarine Spray:
d8 | Effect
1 | The target takes 20d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
2 | The target takes 20d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
3 | The target takes 20d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
4 | The target takes 20d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
5 | The target takes 20d6 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
6 | At the start of each of its turns, the affected target uses all its movement to move directly towards the closest creature it can see. Then, the affected target uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the affected target does nothing this turn. At the end of each of its turns, the affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.
7 | At the start of each of its turns, the affected target gains one level of contamination. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target, but any contamination levels gained remain.
8 | Special: The target is struck by an additional ray. Roll again twice. There's no limit to how many additional rays can strike a single creature in this manner.

    <text>When you cast this spell, you gain one level of contamination. A stroke of eldritch lightning forming a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within the line's area.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

    <text>This spell may only be cast in an area covered by the Deep Haze.
	You perform a holy ceremony involving up to 12 faithful and willing humanoid creatures that ends when each participating creature drives a delerium shard into their chest. Those creatures become sanctified (see the Followers of the Falling Fire dossier in chapter 3 of Dungeons of Drakkenheim).
	When you finish casting this spell, a hostile shadow appears and attacks each participant, as a manifestation of that character's inner darkness. The GM may determine that a character who carries great anger, fear, or hate in their heart causes a wraith to manifest instead.

    <text>This demanding spell transfers contamination from one creature to another. When you cast this spell, you must first touch either a willing humanoid creature with one or more levels of contamination, or a former humanoid creature whose current form is the result of a monstrous transformation. You then touch a different willing humanoid creature.
	If both creatures touched were willing humanoid creatures, you remove all contamination levels and mutations from the first creature, then the second creature you touch gains a number of contamination levels equal to the number of levels removed from the first creature.
	If the first creature you touch is a former humanoid who suffered a monstrous contamination, and the second creature is a willing humanoid creature with a character level or challenge rating equal to or higher than the challenge rating of the transformed creature, you restore the fully contaminated creature to its original form, then the humanoid creature immediately undergoes a monstrous transformation as if it had gained six contamination levels.
	The second creature touched cannot prevent or negate these contamination levels or an ensuing transformation in any way, or else the spell fails with no effect.

Researching the Spell: A character who can cast 6th level spells who knows the spells forced evolution and neutralizing field, and has witnessed another creature undergo a monstrous transformation may research siphon contamination.

When a creature enters the area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d6 poison damage and becomes poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.

In addition, while a creature is soulbound in this way, it can't benefit from being invisible. Creatures possessing robust or more powerful essence within their bodies (typically, those of CR 7 or higher) automatically succeed on this saving throw.
	You can expend a spell slot of 4th level or higher when you create this trap instead of a 2nd-level slot. When you do so, creatures with robust or less powerful essence (typically CR 11 or lower) must make the saving throw, while creatures with potent or more powerful essence automatically succeed.

Because of their nature, pit traps are deployed in the space in which they are created as soon as their construction is finished, and can't be moved. After the trap activates, you can spend 1 minute recovering it, allowing it to be used again.
	You dig a 7-foot-deep hole in dirt, or another diggable surface, in a 5-foot square. You can choose to fill the pit with sharpened stakes, spikes, or any other sharp materials.
	When a Medium or smaller creature moves into the trapped area, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it falls into the pit, where it lands prone, taking 4d8 piercing damage if the trap is filled with spikes. On a success, it avoids the trap, falling prone in the nearest unoccupied space to the trap. A creature that succeeds on the save by 5 or more doesn't fall prone.

With a large, concealed net of rope or vines, and an apparatus hidden in branches or a cave's ceiling, you create a 20-foot square trapped area. Choose a 5-foot square within the trapped area to act as the trigger. When a Small or larger creature enters this square, the trap activates and each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained and hoisted 20 feet up into the air (or as high as the canopy/ceiling allows).

A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your ranger save DC, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) ends the effect and destroys the net.

If there is a Huge or larger creature in the trapped area when it triggers, the trap breaks and has no effect.

Because of their nature, catapult traps are deployed in the space in which they are created as soon as their construction is finished, and can't be moved.
	With bent trees, springs, or elastic rope, you create a 20-foot square of tension. Choose a 5-foot square within the trapped area to act as the trigger. When a Small or larger creature enters this square, the trap activates and each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, a creature can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer in the area. If it's still in the area, it is affected as if it failed its save. A creature that fails the saving throw is flung 60 feet in a direction you decide when you deploy the trap, landing prone and taking 6d10 bludgeoning damage.
	If there is a Gargantuan creature in the trapped area when it triggers, the trap breaks and has no effect.

	Each creature that starts its turn in the area or enters the area for the first time on its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 lightning damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. Each creature that ends its turn in the area must make a Strength saving throw, taking 4d8 force damage and being knocked prone on a failure, or taking half as much damage and not being knocked prone on a success. A creature made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armor has disadvantage on this Strength saving throw.
	The area is difficult terrain for any creatures made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armor.

    <text>With a boom that can be heard 300 feet away (or 1000 feet in a liquid), a pulse of thunder ripples out from a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes 7d6 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage increases to 9d6 if the affected creature is submerged in a liquid.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

    <text>Choose a willing creature you can see within range; it ceases to heed the pained calls of its body, needing neither food nor water to exist. An affected creature ignores the effects of exhaustion, the poisoned condition, and cannot be incapacitated, stunned, paralysed, or fall unconscious. Each time an affected creature takes damage that would reduce its hit points to 0, it makes a death saving throw instead. If the creature fails 3 death saving throws, it dies.
	When the spell ends, the creature gains a level of exhaustion for each death saving throw it failed. If the creature is resurrected after dying from these failed death saving throws, it does not regain consciousness for a duration equal to the time for which this spell affected it. When it wakes, it gains 3 levels of exhaustion.
	If the creature is still alive when the spell ends, it falls unconscious for a duration equal to the time for which this spell affected it. Whilst unconscious in this way, the creature can not be awakened by any means short of a wish spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can increase the duration to 10 minutes (6th level), 1 hour (7th level), 8 hours (8th level) or 1 day (9th level).

    <text>You attempt to create violent emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. A creature that fails this saving throw becomes enraged for the duration.
	While enraged, a target becomes hostile towards all creatures. An enraged creature that is concentrating on a spell must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or lose concentration on the spell.
	As an action, you can force an enraged creature to use its reaction to make one melee weapon attack against one randomly determined creature within the enraged creature's reach. If the enraged creature was friendly towards the target of its attack before this spell was cast, the enraged creature can repeat the saving throw immediately after making the attack, ending the effect on itself on a success.
	An enraged creature can repeat the saving throw whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. When the spell ends, the creature reverts to its previous disposition again, unless the GM rules otherwise.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher and use an action to force an enraged creature to make a melee weapon attack, you can force one additional enraged creature to make a melee weapon attack for each slot level above 3rd.

4 | The creature's condition immunities
5 | The creature's damage vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities
6 | The creature's skill and saving throw proficiences

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and you don't learn anything. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or lower automatically succeeds on the saving throw.
	If a creature fails the initial saving throw then, on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 4d6 psychic damage and you learn something about the creature (roll a d6 and consult the table above). On a success, the creature takes half as much damage, you don't learn anything, and the spell ends. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial and ongoing damage increases by 1d10 and 1d6, respectively, for each slot level above 3rd.

    <text>With an exhalation, fungal spores waft their way towards a point within range. Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centred on that point must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become cursed until the spell ends.

When you cast the spell, choose one of the following fungi to grow on the cursed creatures:

	• Amanita Rotgut. The creature immediately takes 2d6 poison damage and becomes poisoned. While poisoned in this way, the creature takes 2d6 poison damage at the end of each of its subsequent turns.

	• Necrotising Zygomycosis. The creature immediately takes 2d8 necrotic damage, and takes 2d8 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns.

	• Psilocybin Quickitrippiae. The creature begins 'tripping'. It must roll a d4 at the start of each of its turns. On a 1 the creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.

	• Paralysing Mucorales. At the end of each of the creature's turns, it becomes stunned until the start of its next turn. If the creature fails a saving throw against this spell by 5 or more then, if it would be stunned, it is paralysed instead.

	• Raging Henbane. The creature becomes charmed by you and must use its reaction at the start of each of its turns to make one weapon attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach/range other than you.

	• Veiled Lady. The creature's vision darkens to a pinhole; the creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and ranged attacks have advantage against the creature.

An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns (after the effects of this spell have triggered), ending the effect on itself on a success.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) of Amanita Rotgut and Necrotising Zygomycosis increases by 1d6 and 1d8, respectively, for each slot level above 4th. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can choose two different fungi to grow on affected targets instead of one.

If the spell ends before the start of your next turn, a creature takes 4d10 force damage on a failure instead. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, both damage values increase by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.

    <text>You utter a bestial, magically-augmented howl that can be heard for 1000 feet. The howl can manifest as any animal call you've heard, such as the screech of a hawk or trumpet of an elephant. Choose one creature with whom you are familiar as the recipient: if it can hear your howl, it understands your meaning and can respond in a likewise manner.
	Creatures other than your recipient that hear the howl and that are under the effects of the comprehend languages spell or similar magic, or that can understand beasts, can understand the howl's meaning. Otherwise, the howl is unintelligible to creatures that can hear it.

At the start of each of the target's turns for the duration, it can choose to become incorporeal (no action required) until the end of its turn. While incorporeal, it has advantage on Stealth checks; it gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; and it can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If the target ends its turn inside an object, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet it is shunted.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot level of 6th level or higher, you can choose to increase the spell's duration, or the number of targets, for each slot level above 5th. If you choose duration, the duration increases in increments to 10 minutes (6th level), 1 hour (7th level), 8 hours (8th level), or 24 hours (9th level). If you choose to increase the number of targets, the number increases by 1 for each slot level.

    <text>You twist the fates of two creatures you can see, both of whom must be within range. Choose one target to favor and one to disfavor. The disfavored target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or the following effects occur:

	• Whenever the favored target makes an attack roll or saving throw before the spell ends, the favored target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack or saving throw.

	• Whenever the disfavored target makes an attack roll or saving throw before the spell ends, the disfavored target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack or saving throw.

	• The disfavored target's speed is halved, whilst the favored target's speed increases by half.

These effects end for the pair if either of the target pair is knocked unconscious, killed, or the spell ends. While under the influence of this spell, a favored target can't benefit from the bless spell, and a disfavored target can't be afflicted by the bane spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can link two other creatures, favoring one, and disfavoring the other, for each two slot levels above 2nd.

A poisoned creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
	Whilst poisoned in this way, a creature must roll a d12 at the start of each of its turns. On a 3 or lower, it is racked by a coughing fit and becomes incapacitated until the start of its next turn.

On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and does not begin suffocating. A creature suffocating in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending its suffocation on a success.
	A creature that does not need to breathe is immune to the effects of this spell. A greater restoration, heal, or wish spell can restore a creature's ability to breathe, and end its suffocation.

	• Armor. A creature wearing this armor gains 1d4 temporary hit points at the start of each of its turns.

	• Belt. A creature wearing this belt gains a flying speed of 30 feet.

	• Boots. A creature wearing these boots has its walking speed increased by 10 feet and its jump distance tripled.

	• Cloak. A creature wearing this cloak has advantage on Stealth checks it makes to hide and can hide while only lightly obscured.

	• Gloves. A creature wearing these gloves gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed and can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, it has advantage on any ability checks it makes related to grappling.

	• Headwear. A creature wearing this headwear doesn't need to breathe, has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and has resistance to poison damage.

You can end this spell early by touching the item. The spell ends if you cast it again.

If a creature dies while soulbound, its magic is bound to its components for 24 hours allowing harvesting to start at any time within this period (see page 87 for the rules on harvesting). Once harvesting starts on a corpse under the effect of this spell, the spell ends for that corpse. Creatures possessing robust or more powerful essence (typically, those of CR 7 or higher) automatically succeed on this saving throw.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the strength of the essence possessed by creatures that allows them to automatically succeed on the saving throw increases by one tier for each two slot levels above 2nd. Creatures with potent or more powerful essence (typically CR 12 or higher) automatically succeed at 4th level, mythic (typically CR 18 or higher) at 6th level, and deific (typically CR 25 or higher) at 8th level.

    <text>You inhale deeply, magically enhancing the scents that surround you. You have advantage on the next ability check you make that relies on smell, and you can treat a roll of 4 or lower as a 5.
	When you reach higher levels, this spell gives you an increasingly astute ability to identify the source of the scents around you. When you reach 5th level, whenever you make an ability check that relies on smell, you can treat a d20 roll of 7 or lower as an 8. At 11th level, a roll of 10 or lower is treated as an 11, and at 17th level, a roll of 13 or lower is treated as a 14.

    <text>You trace a warding sigil in the air, sending it to slowly circle a willing creature you can see for the next hour. Immediately before the target next takes damage, except psychic damage, the ward triggers. Until the end of the target's next turn, it has resistance to all damage excluding psychic, including the triggering damage. The warding sigil then disappears, and the spell ends on the target.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you may target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

For the duration, the target must make a Strength saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a failure, it is dragged 30 feet in the direction you chose, and its swimming speed is reduced to 0 feet until the start of its next turn. On a success, the creature can move normally until the start of its next turn.
	As a bonus action on your turn, you can change the direction of the underwater currents. The spell ends early if the creature is ever out of the spell's range, or is no longer in water at least 2 feet deep.

If you yourself are the source, the creature takes this damage immediately before you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration.

For the duration, any creature hit (or in the case of 'Hawk', targeted) by one of the pieces of ammunition is subject to the effect of the spirit currently imbuing the quiver (see below), in addition to the attack's normal effects. As a bonus action, you can change which spirit imbues the quiver.

Cat: The target takes an additional 1d6 slashing damage. If the attack roll was made with advantage, the additional damage is increased to 2d6.

Elk: The target takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone or shoved 5 feet in a direction of your choice (you choose when the target is hit).

Hawk: The attack ignores half and three-quarters cover.

Hogweed: The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of its next turn.

Psilocybin: The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or begin 'tripping' for the spell's duration. Whilst tripping, the creature must roll a d4 at the start of each of its turns. On a 1, the target is incapacitated until the end of its turn and the effect ends. On a 2-4 the target behaves as normal, and the effect continues.

Roc: The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or its speed becomes 0 and it is lifted 20 feet into the air until the end of its next turn, when it begins falling. If there isn't enough room to be lifted 20 feet, the creature is lifted to the maximum possible height.

Snake: The target takes an additional 1d6 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for the spell's duration. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Spider: The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained until the end of its next turn. The target can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration of this spell is concentration, up to 8 hours.

On a success, the spell is cast as normal. On a failure, the spellcaster casts the spell and produces an additional effect. Roll a d10 and consult the following table to determine the additional effect:

d10 | Effect
1 | The spellcaster casts gravity smash*
2 | The spellcaster casts phantasmal killer
3 | The spellcaster casts confusion
4 | The spellcaster casts fireball

8 | The spellcaster casts silence
9 | The spellcaster regains 2d10 hit points
10 | The spellcaster doesn't expend a spell slot to cast its spell

Any additional spell cast this way targets or is centred on the spellcaster, who has no control over the spell's effects. The DC for any saving throws equals the spellcaster's spell save DC. In the case of concentration spells, no concentration is required. At initiative count 20 of each round, roll a d20 for each ongoing additional effect. On a roll of 11 or higher, that effect ends.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you increase the radius of the area affected by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

If you silence a target that is casting a spell with verbal components, the target's spell slot isn't expended, but its action is wasted.
	At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Strength saving throw as it tries to tear open its mouth. On a success, the target takes 1d8 slashing damage and is no longer silenced. Alternatively, as an action, the target can use a bladed implement to cut open its mouth, taking 1d8 slashing damage and ending the silence.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

	A creature remains transformed unless the effect is reversed within one year with greater restoration, wish, or similar magical effects. If the creature spends one year and a day as a tree, the transformation becomes permanent, and nothing can return the creature to its original form.

    <text>As part of casting this spell, you must expend three hit dice or the spell automatically fails. If you do, roll the expended hit dice, and the creature gains an equal number of temporary hit points.
	For the duration of the spell, you know the direction and distance to the creature at all times, you and the creature can speak to one another telepathically (provided the creature has an intelligence score of 3 or higher), and you can target the creature with spells you cast that have a range of Self or Touch. These benefits are suppressed while you and the creature are not on the same plane.
	At any point, a creature affected by this spell can choose to end the spell early. If it does, the creature loses all remaining temporary hit points granted by this spell and takes necrotic damage equal to the temporary hit points lost.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th or 6th level, its duration is 8 hours. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, its duration is 24 hours. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, its duration is 7 days.

    <text>A momentary bubble of iridescent energy shimmers in the air between you and the caster of the triggering spell. The spell is redirected to a creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet. If the spell is 5th level or lower, you are no longer a target of the spell and the chosen creature is instead. If the spell is 6th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, you are no longer a target of the spell and the chosen creature is instead. On a failed check, you remain the target of the triggering spell.

When you do, choose an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend within range and condemn it to a taste of mortality. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or have its current and maximum hit points reduced. Roll the hit dice expended to cast this spell to determine the amount the creature's current and maximum hit points are reduced by.
	Additionally, for the duration of the spell, a creature that fails the saving throw loses all damage immunities and resistances, its creature type changes to humanoid, and takes an additional 1d4 necrotic damage each time it takes damage.
	If a creature affected by this spell is reduced to 0 hit points, these changes become permanent and the creature dies. This final effect of the spell can only be reversed if the creature is restored to life and targeted by a remove curse spell or similar magic.

As part of casting this spell, you must expend nine hit dice or the spell automatically fails. If you do, roll the expended hit dice and note the total as your "mortal hit points," then the creature who triggered this spell by being reduced to 0 hp immediately dies. If it would normally return to its native plane at 0 hp, it is destroyed instead. Change your creature type to that of the dead creature.
	Whilst changed, you are immune to poison and disease; no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe; resistant to nonmagical damage; and gain a benefit dependent on your new creature type:

Celestial: You have resistance to radiant and necrotic damage and gain a fly speed of 60 feet.

Elemental: You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage.

Fey: You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to turn invisible until the start of your next turn or teleport up to 60 feet in any direction.

Fiend: You have resistance to cold and fire damage and gain a fly speed of 60 feet.

Your creature type is retained until you cast the spell again, immediately ending its effects, or you take damage that reduces you to 0 hp, wherein your creature type returns to normal and your hp to the number noted as your mortal hit points.

    <text>Prerequisite: 9th level, Slime Lord patron

The Slime Lord grants you the ability to summon moving patches of slime mold. You can cast grease twice without expending a spell slot or material components.
	In addition, whenever you are concentrating on the grease spell, you can use your bonus action to move the covered area up to 10 feet across the ground and other surfaces. If the grease moves into the area occupied by a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity save against your spell save DC or fall prone.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

Counterspell:
You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level.

You've learned to use your ki to disrupt the magical nature of other creatures or objects. You can spend 8 ki points to cast antimagic field as an action, using Wisdom as your spellcasting modifier.

Antimagic Field:
A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

Targeted Effects:
Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

Areas of Magic:
The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.

Spells:
Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

Magic Items:
The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.

A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

Magical Travel:
Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.

Creatures and Objects:
A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

Dispel Magic:
Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.

	In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.
	Additional Ki Points: When you cast this spell by spending 3 or more ki points, the damage increases by 1d8 for each ki point above 2.

    <text>You can create a blast of compressed air that strikes like a mighty fist. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points and choose a creature or object within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 thunder damage, plus an extra 1d10 thunder damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can push the creature or object up to 20 feet away from you and knock it prone. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and you don't push it or knock it prone. If your target is secured to a structure, such as a door that is secured to a wall by hinges, that object automatically succeeds on this saving throw.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

Gust of Wind:
A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell's duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.
	Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.
	The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.
	As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.

A creature or object that you can see that is within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw.

You can spend 3 ki points to cast meld into stone.

Meld Into Stone:
You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.
	While merged with the stone, you can't see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can't move.
	Minor physical damage to the stone doesn't harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone's complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

Gaseous Form:
You transform yourself, along with everything you're wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points.
	While in this form, your only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. You can enter and occupy the space of another creature. You have resistance to nonmagical damage, and you have advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.

You teleport yourself to an unoccupied space you can see within range.

Wind Walk:
You assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can't move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.
	If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.

You can spend 4 ki points to cast dominate person.

Dominate Person:
You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.
	While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
	You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.
	Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

Charmed:
	• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
	• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

Investiture of Flame:
Flames race across your body, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet for the spell's duration. The flames don't harm you. Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits:

	• You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire damage.

	• You can move across difficult terrain created by ice or snow without spending extra movement.

	• The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. The radius moves with you.

	• You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing wind extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect has its speed halved until the start of your next turn.

Investiture of Stone:
Until the spell ends, bits of rock spread across your body, and you gain the following benefits:

	• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

	• You can use your action to create a small earthquake on the ground in a 15-foot radius centered on you. Other creatures on that ground must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

	• You can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone without spending extra movement. You can move through solid earth or stone as if it was air and without destabilizing it, but you can't end your movement there. If you do so, you are ejected to the nearest unoccupied space, this spell ends, and you are stunned until the end of your next turn.

Prone:
	•  A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

Stunned:
	• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.
	• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

Investiture of Wind:
Until the spell ends, wind whirls around you, and you gain the following benefits:

	• Ranged weapon attacks made against you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

	• You gain a flying speed of 60 feet. If you are still flying when the spell ends, you fall, unless you can somehow prevent it.

	• You can use your action to create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.

You can spend 4 ki points to cast bones of the earth.

Bones of the Earth:
You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
	If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.
	If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) against the spell's save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

You can spend 4 ki points to cast wall of stone.

Wall of Stone:
A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least on other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.
	If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.
	The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. the wall doesn't need to be vertical or resting on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.
	If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.
	The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.
	If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

A creature that is still in flight when the spell ends floats safely to the ground, as if by the feather fall spell.
	When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can cause one of the following effects:

	• The cylinder fills with magical silence. No sound can be created within or pass through the cylinder. Any creature or object entirely inside the cylinder is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Performing verbal components of spells is impossible within the cylinder. This silence lasts until the spell ends, you dispel it as a bonus action, or you fill the cylinder with magical amplification.

	• The cylinder fills with magical amplification. Creatures within the cylinder make saving throws against effects that deal thunder damage with disadvantage, and nonmagical objects and structures become vulnerable to thunder damage while inside. Spells that can normally only target creatures can also target nonmagical objects and structures within the cylinder. This amplification lasts until the spell ends, you dispel it as a bonus action, or until you fill the cylinder with magical silence.

	• You compress the air in the cylinder. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

The Wild Magic Surge table can be found in Chapter 3 of the Player's Handbook, under the description of the Wild Magic Sorcerous Origin.

	• Spells cast within the cylinder that restore hit points function as if they were cast using a spell slot one level higher than the spell slot used.

	• If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 7th level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.

A mephit summoned in this way disappears when the spell ends or if it leaves the cylinder.

	• You mentally command all mephits summoned by this spell to immediately die, triggering their Death Burst traits.

	• You ignite all flammable objects within the cylinder. Creatures are also at risk of catching on fire and must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or else catch fire. A creature that is on fire or is wearing or holding something that is on fire takes 1d8 fire damage at the start of each of its turns, and can take this damage no more than once each turn. A creature can use its action to drop prone and extinguish the flames on it. Flames ignited in this way go out when the spell ends or if they leave the cylinder.

	• No attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws in the area can be made with advantage or disadvantage.

	• Any rolls that would normally use 1d20 use 2d10 instead.

	• A creature that moves within the cylinder on its turn can only move in one direction that turn and must move its full speed until it leaves the cylinder. If it can't move its full speed in that direction (for example, if it would be blocked by a wall), it can't move in that direction at all.

    <text>You begin to merge your current plane of existence with a plane of shadow and lethargy in a 30-foot-radius, 60-foot-tall cylinder centered on a point that you can see within range. That area is under the following effects for the duration of the spell:

	• Creatures in the cylinder's area are immune to the frightened and charmed conditions. If a creature is frightened or charmed when it is in the area of the spell, the effect causing that condition ends for that creature.

	• All saving throws made in the cylinder against effects that deal necrotic damage are made with advantage or disadvantage (your choice when you cast the spell).

	• When a humanoid creature dies in the cylinder, it immediately becomes a zombie under your mental control. All zombies created in this manner share your initiative count, but act immediately after you. These zombies return to mundane corpses when the spell ends or if they leave the cylinder.

When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can cause one of the following effects:

	• The cylinder fills with magical darkness until you dispel it as a bonus action or until the spell ends. If this effect overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 5th level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

	• Each creature in the cylinder must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be stricken with extreme lethargy. A creature that fails this saving throw wastes its next turn doing nothing. Undead and constructs are immune to this effect.

	• All creatures in the area make death saving throws with either advantage or disadvantage (your choice when you cast the spell).

When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can summon spirits from beyond the grave. A random incorporeal undead appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within the area. It is indifferent to all other creatures, but will defend itself if attacked. The creatures disappear if they leave the cylinder or when the spell ends. To determine what type of undead appears, roll 1d12 and consult the following table.

It is perpetually raining within this cylinder, and all nonmagical fires are extinguished. A creature that is wet within this cylinder has disadvantage on saving throws against cold or lightning damage. This water disappears when the spell ends or if it leaves the cylinder.
	When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can cause one of the following effects:

	• You magically conjure 1d4 ice mephits, mud mephits, or steam mephits (your choice) in unoccupied spaces of your choice within the cylinder. They are hostile to all creatures that are not elementals and act on their own initiative count. These mephits lack the Summon Mephits action. A mephit summoned in this way disappears when the spell ends or if it leaves the cylinder.

	• You mentally command all mephits summoned by this spell to immediately die, triggering their Death Burst traits.

	• You fill the cylinder with magical fog, as if by the fog cloud spell. This fog dissipates when the spell ends or when you dispel it as a bonus action, and can't be blown away by a strong wind.

	• You cause the water on all surfaces in the cylinder to freeze. These surfaces count as difficult terrain, and any creature that makes a Strength (Athletics) check, Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, or that takes the Dash action on an icy surface must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save the creature falls prone immediately after completing the check or action and takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, nothing happens.

You choose the type of beast or swarm of beasts, which must be of challenge rating rating 5 or lower, such as a giant shark or swarm of poisonous snakes.
	The beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned creature is friendly to you and your companions. It rolls its own initiative and has its own turns, but obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. The DM has the creature's statistics.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 4th.

    <text>You toss a clockwork puppet to an unoccupied space that you can see within range. When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it, seeing the object for what it really is. To others, the decoy projects the illusion of a medium humanoid of your choice that performs a taunting dance or an intimidating gesture goading them to fight it. As a bonus action on your turn, you can mentally command the puppet and the illusion to move up to 20 feet.
	Creatures that start their turn within 10 feet of the puppet must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is compelled to move toward the decoy and make a melee weapon attack against it, believing it to be the primary threat. Attacks against the illusion harmlessly flow through the illusion and do not usually damage the puppet, though exceptions can occur. On a successful save, a creature realizes that the projected humanoid is an illusion and becomes immune to the effects of this spell for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition automatically succeed on this save. The effect on a creature also ends if it takes any damage.

    <text>You perform a ritual of folk magic designed to bring the blessings of gods or spirits on those who take part.

Blessing of the Exorcism: One individual you touch who is charmed or possessed may immediately make a saving throw against that effect (as the original saving throw), ending the effect on a success. Once a creature receives this blessing, it can't do so again for 7 days.

Blessing of the Faithful: You perform a worship service with a number of creatures up to your caster level, all of whom must be within 30 feet of you for the duration of the spell. Those creatures gain advantage on their next saving throw against being charmed or frightened for the next 24 hours. Once a creature receives this blessing, it can't do so again for 7 days.

Blessing of the Feast: You partake in a feast with a number of creatures up to your caster level, all of whom must be within 30 feet for the duration of the spell. Those creatures can each roll 1d4 and add the number rolled an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes within the next 24 hours. If those creatures have spent at least 24 hours fasting (abstaining from eating, drinking or other specific behaviors as defined by your faith) before taking part in this ceremony, they can apply this blessing to one of each of those rolls within the next 24 hours. Once a creature receives this blessing, it can't do so again for 30 days.

Blessing of the Hearth: You ward a single structure, or part of a larger structure, which fits within a 50 foot cube that you are in when you cast this spell. Creatures that complete an entire long rest within the affected area at any point in the next 7 days are blessed while within the area. Whenever such a creature makes an ability check or saving throw while in the affected area, it can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the result. This blessing ends on a creature the next time it takes a long rest outside of the affected area. Once a structure or part of a structure has been blessed in this way, it can't be blessed in this way again for 1 year.

Blessing of Industry: You bless a vehicle, musical instrument, or set of artisan's tools, that you can see, selected when you cast the spell. Once each day for the following 7 days, a creature using the equipment can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to a single check using that object. Once a creature has an object belonging to them blessed in this way, they may not have another object of the same type blessed for another year. For example, an individual may have a brewers kit blessed, then a boat blessed, but may not have their brewers kit blessed again for a year.

Blessing of the Pilgrim: You touch a creature, giving it protection for an upcoming voyage. For the next 7 days, that creature can roll 1d4 each time it makes a saving throw against exhaustion or inclement weather and add the number rolled to the result, provided that they are traveling to a single destination during that time. If they change destinations or reach their destination during that time, this effect ends. Once a creature receives this blessing, it can't do so again for 30 days.

Blessing of the Sick: You bless one creature you touch that is afflicted with a disease or poison. The creature immediately makes a saving throw against the effect with advantage. Once a creature receives this blessing, it can't do so again for a day.

	Physical interaction with the wall reveals it to be an illusion, and a creature that uses its action to examine the wall can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the wall. Otherwise, the opaque sections block line of sight.

    <text>You choose a creature, an object, or a place within range and create an illusion no larger than a 100 ft cube. If an arcane eye, clairvoyance, scrying spell, or similar magic would perceive the target, it instead perceives the illusion that you created when you cast this spell. This illusion can only be perceived by that type of magic, and does not affect creatures perceiving the target through nonmagical means. The illusion can include visuals, sounds, smells, tastes, and other stimuli, but it can't deal damage or impose conditions.
	For example, you could cast this spell on an area that includes the hallway of a gang's hideout, allowing you to walk through that hallway without notifying the warlock guards who are scrying on it.
	Suspicious creatures can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC. On a success, they realize it's an illusion, but can't perceive past the illusion. If the spell is cast on a creature or object, it follows that creature or object.
	Casting this spell on the same area every day for 30 days makes this effect permanent.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the illusion can be 100 ft larger for each spell level above 4th.

A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success, or taking 2d4 slashing damage on a failure. Each 5-foot square section has AC 5, 15 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.

Item: a suit of armor (requires attunement)

When you finish a short or long rest, you can cast a cantrip or a spell of 1st level with a casting time of 1 action, and describe a circumstance. For example, you could set up the armor to cast cure wounds on the person wearing this armor when they are reduced to zero hit points. The spell takes effect when the circumstance you described is met, rather than when you cast it. The spell can only affect the person wearing and attuned to this item, even if it can normally target others. Once the spell is cast, the armor loses this ability until the next dawn.

Earth Tremor:
You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

Dust Devil:
Choose an unoccupied 5-foot cube of air that you can see within range. An elemental force that resembles a dust devil appears in the cube and lasts for the spell's duration.
	Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the dust devil must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the dust devil. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
	As a bonus action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet in any direction. If the dust devil moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or light gravel, it sucks up the material and forms a 10-foot-radius cloud of debris around itself that lasts until the start of your next turn. The cloud heavily obscures its area.

Maximilian's Earthen Grasp:
You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the spell's duration.
	As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	To break out, the restrained target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.
	As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.
	When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can't pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can't pass through it.

You create a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range.

The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall's space is difficult terrain.
	Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot-square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall's water doesn't fill it.

You can spend 4 ki points to cast control water.

Control Water:
Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

Flood: You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.
	If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.
	The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.

Part Water: You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.

Redirect Flow: You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.

Whirlpool: This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.
	When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.
	The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The sphere's space is difficult terrain.
	Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage.
	Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to listen.

Additional Ki Points: When you cast this spell using additional ki points, the damage for each of its effects increases by 1d6 for each ki point above 4.

You can spend 4 ki points to cast watery sphere.

You conjure up a sphere of water with a 5-foot radius at a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell's duration.
	Any creature in the sphere's space must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space of the creature's choice outside the sphere. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically, and a Large or smaller creature can choose to fail it. On a failed save, a creature is restrained by the sphere and is engulfed by the water. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
	The sphere can restrain as many as four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature that causes it to exceed this capacity, a random creature that was already restrained by the sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 5 feet of it.
	As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, a cliff, or other drop-off, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet above the ground. Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the saving throw.
	When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone in the space where it falls. The water then vanishes.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

Fire Shield:
Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.
	The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.
	In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.

Immolation:
Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the spell's duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one. These magical flames can't be extinguished by nonmagical means.
	If damage from this spell kills a target, the target is turned to ash.

You can spend 4 ki points to cast control winds.

Control Winds:
You take control of the air in a 100-foot cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following effects when you cast the spell. The effect lasts for the spell's duration, unless you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you've halted.

Gusts: A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction you designate. You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that pass through it or that are made against targets within the cube have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.

Downdraft: You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a Strength saving throw if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

Updraft: You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube's bottom side. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

You can spend 4 ki points to cast move earth.

Move Earth:
Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.
	At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.
	Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement.
	This spell can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.
	Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

You can spend 5 ki points to cast flesh to stone.

Flesh to Stone:
You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into stone. If the target's body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn't affected.
	A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.
	If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.
	If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.

Petrified:
	• A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.
	• The creature is incapacitated (meaning it can't take actions or reactions), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
	• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	• The creature has resistance to all damage.
	• The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

You can spend 4 ki points to cast Otiluke's freezing sphere.

Otiluke's Freezing Sphere:
A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.
	If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.
	You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it explodes.

Additional Ki Points: When you cast this spell using additional ki points, the damage increases by 1d6 for each ki point above 4.

Primordial Ward:
You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage for the spell's duration.
	When you take damage of one of those types, you can use your reaction to gain immunity to that type of damage, including against the triggering damage. If you do so, the resistances end, and you have the immunity until the end of your next turn, at which time the spell ends.

You can spend 4 ki points to cast wall of ice.

Wall of Ice:
You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.
	If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
	The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Additional Ki Points: When you cast this spell using additional ki points, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each ki point above 4.

    <text>You attempt to take control of a fey creature that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be controlled by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.
	While the fey creature is controlled, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or
"Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
	You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.
	Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot above 4th level.

Invoking the laws of the Pact Primeval, you bind willing creatures into a contract which ensures everyone involved upholds their end of the bargain.
	In preparation for you casting the spell, each entity to be involved with and bound by the contract must willingly provide a vial of its own blood, which is then mixed with ink. The magical ink used to draft this contract cannot be made invisible, glows red, and is warm to the touch. Additionally, any text written with this ink can be understood by entities whose blood has been used in the ink's creation, regardless of the language or handwriting style used.
	The spell can only be cast if all entities whose blood is mixed with the ink have signed it with their true names. Whenever a clause is added or removed, any existing signature disappears. If a creature has less than 8 Intelligence, Wisdom and/or Charisma at the moment the spell is cast, if it has been coerced by force, threats or magic into signing, or if it signs with anything other than its true name, the magic does not take hold, and the spell's components are wasted.
	The contract bursts in flames after it is signed by all involved parties. From the moment the contract is in effect to the moment it is terminated, all involved parties can magically summon or dismiss a copy of the contract into existence as an action. Unless specified otherwise, the contract is terminated when one of the parties dies.
	The contract must contain at least the following two elements: commitments and exit clauses.

Commitments:
Each party involved makes one or more promises to the other parties. If one of the commitments is not met, then the contract is terminated, and the exit clause for the party who failed to deliver on their promise is invoked.
	This magical contract allows you to do transactions that could not be performed without magic. However, the contract cannot allow you to give something you do not possess. Here are examples of possible commitments:

	• Arcane Power. You give the recipient some of the spells you know, and some of your spell slots. The recipient can cast those spells, using those spell slots. They use their own spellcasting ability modifier, using the same Ability Score you would have used to cast those spells. These spells and spell slots are not available to you anymore, until the contract is terminated. This is often what is offered to Warlocks.

	• Memory. The recipient is given your memory of an event. The contract may let you keep a copy of these memories, or they are lost to you until the contract is terminated. This is often used in courts, to ensure the veracity of a testimony.

	• A sense. You can decide to either give, or share a sense with another party. If you give your sense of sight to a blind person, they will regain their vision, but you will lose yours. You could decide to share a sense instead. If you do, the blind person will not regain their vision-instead, they will see everything that you see, from your point of view, until the contract is terminated.

	• A favor. You can specify a task to be completed before a certain date. Alternatively, you can specify a number of favors to be reclaimed later.

	• Your eternal soul. If an entity possesses your soul, they can summon your soul within 30 feet of them as an action, or dismiss your soul back to where it was before you were summoned in the same way. They can read your thoughts, and have access to all of your memories. You are unable to disobey any verbal or telepathic command they give you, and they know if you tell them a lie. Finally, while your soul is forfeit, you cannot sign any additional infernal contract.

Unless specified otherwise within the contract, when the contract is terminated for any reason, the contract magically returns any item, experience, memory, sense, favor, or soul that had been given to their original owners.
	If a commitment can be interpreted in different ways, the party who makes the commitment decides which interpretation is correct when they make it.

Exit Clauses:
You must describe what happens to each party should they fail to deliver on their commitments within the agreed upon timeframe. Again, the contract can enforce things through the use of magic that would otherwise be impossible. Here are examples of common exit clauses:

	• Curse. The faulty party receives a curse, as per the bestow curse spell, as if it had been cast as a 9th level spell. They fail the saving throw automatically.

	• Recall. The faulty party is teleported to the location where the contract was signed.

	• Imprisonment. The faulty party is imprisoned, as per the imprisonment spell, for a duration to be specified. They fail the saving throw automatically.

	• Compensation. The faulty party makes a new commitment as a penalty. For example, the party could have their ability to speak taken away as punishment.

	• Punishment. The faulty party suffers one of the effects of the symbol spell. They fail the saving throw automatically.

A wish spell can be used to terminate the contract without being subjected to its exit clauses.
	If an exit clause can be interpreted in different ways, the parties who did not fail their commitments decide which interpretation is correct when the exit clause is invoked.
	Long ago, the Fey collectively signed an infernal contract which made it so their word became magically binding. Because of this, any promise or agreement made orally to or by a fey creature instantly results in the casting of this spell, with clauses determined automatically.

	As an action, you can touch a willing creature with a CR up to 1/3 of your level and absorb their essence into your body. For as long as you concentrate up to 8 hours (or until you use an action to end the effect early) the companion appears on your body as a mark that relates to them. This can be a claw scar, an eagle tattoo, or even a birthmark in the shape of an otter. You can choose a new appearance every time you cast this spell. While absorbed this way, the companion sees what you see and can communicate telepathically with you as if they were walking right alongside you.
	When the spell ends, the creature appears in the nearest unoccupied space of your choice.

    <text>You can attempt to possess a creature by transforming into a pure spiritual force to take control of it. One humanoid that you can see within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be possessed by you; you then disappear, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. You now control the body but don't deprive the target of awareness. You can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and you retain your alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and class abilities and features. You otherwise use the possessed target's statistics, but don't gain access to the target's knowledge, features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, you end it as a bonus action, or you are turned or forced out by an effect such as dispel evil and good. When the possession ends, you reappear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body in your true form. The target is immune to this spell for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the spell ends.

    <text>As a part of this spell, make a melee attack with a weapon available to you. When you roll your attack roll, also roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. All the creatures of your choice within 90 feet of you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points. Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell becomes frightened of you until either the spell ends or when they succeed on a wisdom saving throw against this spell. A creature can attempt this saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effects on themselves on a success. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an extra 2d8 for each spell slot above 1st.

The terrain 10 feet around each section of the wall becomes thick with sticky clay, creating difficult terrain. Moving through an affected square consumes 3 feet of movement per 1 foot moved. Each 5-foot-square wall section has AC 10 and 10 hit points. Reducing a section to 0 hit points destroys that section and removes the difficult terrain in a 5-foot-radius around it.

As a bonus action, you can choose to lower or raise each creature in the area by 20 feet and up to 60 feet into the air. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your bonus action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.
	When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

    <level>0</level>
    <classes>Ranger (HeavyArms): Bushcraft</classes>
    <text>Prerequisite: 1st-level ranger (HeavyArms)

You can summon a Beast with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower from the surrounding area to serve as your animal companion. The summoning ritual takes 1 hour, and can be performed during a short or long rest. The creature accompanies you until you dismiss it, you no longer meet the prerequisites to summon it, you use this feature to summon a different creature, or you die. The following rules apply to your animal companion:

Actions: Your companion is friendly to you and obeys your commands. It loses its Multiattack action, if it has one. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but it only takes evasive actions, unless it is forced to defend itself. If you are incapacitated, your companion can take any action of its choice, though it focuses on protecting you and itself. If the creature has an appropriate anatomy to serve as a mount, it acts under your control while you are riding it.

Game Statistics: Your companion's statistics are altered while it travels with you. It uses your proficiency bonus instead of its own, and adds your proficiency bonus to the AC in its stat block, to a maximum AC of 18. The creature is also considered proficient in all saving throws. Finally, your companion doesn't have Hit Die. Instead, its hit point maximum is calculated as follows:

	Companion hit point maximum = (5 + its Constitution modifier) x your ranger level

Resting: At the end of a short rest, your companion regains hit points up to half its hit point maximum. At the end of a long rest, it regains all its lost hit points.

Dropping to 0 Hit Points: If your companion is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, it falls unconscious and makes death saving throws, just like a player character.

You can spend 1 focus point as a bonus action to command your companion to you take one of the actions in its stat block. If you command it to attack, it can make another attack as a bonus action, provided both attacks target the same creature and the target is one of your favored enemies. In addition, your companion gains the following benefits:

	• Your companion gains a bonus to its damage rolls equal to your proficiency bonus.

	• The initial saving throw DC of your companion's features that force a target to make a saving throw equals 10 + your proficiency bonus if this total is higher than the DC shown in the creature's stat block.

Over the course of a long rest, you can create one mutagenic decoction of your choice.

Creating decoctions requires access to a set of alchemist's supplies and an empty flask for each one you create. A decoction lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest, after which time it spoils and is wasted.
	A creature can drink one of your mutagenic decoctions as an action. The benefits granted by a decoction last until the drinker finishes a short or long rest, unless the decoction's description explicitly says otherwise. Only creatures with the Mutagencraft skill can withstand the harmful side effects of mutagenic decoctions; if a creature without the Mutagencraft skill drinks one of your decoctions, it gains 1 level of exhaustion and becomes poisoned until the decoction's effects end (the decoction's effects end early if the condition is removed).

	The tent is made of magical canvas, supported by iron poles. The ten supporting poles each have AC 19 and 24 hit points, immunity to damage from non-magical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the tent (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes one column to regain 50 Hit Points.

    <text>A 20-foot-radius sphere of vile-smelling necrotic gas of a green shade magically swirls forth from a point that you choose within range. The gas eats away at the lungs of any creature in the area and creates a particular form of choking zombie from those who die due to the spell. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.
	When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 4d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are not affected if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe. The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.
	If a creature falls to 0 hit points, it rises as a zombie at the end of the round with the following modification:

	• Choking Strike: The zombie chokes the living, trying to suck the air from the lungs of its victims. Any creature hit by the slam attack of the zombie must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC equals 10 + the zombie's Constitution ability modifier) or gain one level of exhaustion.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.

On a success, the spell ends on the target. On a successful save that creature is unaffected and is immune to the effects of the spell for 24 hours.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the emanation increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 4th.

Frightened:
	• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.

If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. The GM has the creatures' statistics.
	When a shadow creature attacks or interacts with a target, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. On a failed save, the shadow creature deals full damage. On a success, the shadow creature only deals half damage and has half of its total hit points for the rest of the spell's duration.

You sing a haunting melody that evokes the presence of the lurking horrors beyond the veil. Choose one creature within 30 feet of you. It is partially absorbed by the cosmos for 1 hour, gaining a +10 bonus to Stealth checks and becoming unable to be tracked except by magical means. In addition, as an action, the creature can become incorporeal and move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain until the end of its turn. If it ends its turn inside an object, it takes 5 (1d10) force damage and is immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space. Once the creature uses this action, it can't do so again for the duration of the transformation.
	Starting at 14th level, when the creature uses an action to become incorporeal, the effect lasts for 10 minutes instead.

    <text>Prerequisite: Sanguine Chapter Jaeger

As a bonus action, you can expend all of your Momentum dice to drain the blood of a creature within 5 feet of you magically consuming its vitality as your own. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your Blood Magic save DC. On a failed save, it takes necrotic damage equal to the number rolled on each of the expended Momentum dice. On successful save, it takes half as much damage. Success or failure, you regain hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt.
	If the target is bloodied (has half its maximum hit points or fewer) after taking the damage from this Finisher or if you use this Finisher against a creature suffering from an effect that makes it bleed (such as Hemorrhaging Wound), you regain 1 Focus Point.

    <text>When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend all of your Momentum dice to force the target to make a saving throw, suffering a condition for 1 minute on a failure. The DC of the save is 8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus. The type of saving throw and the condition depend on the number of Momentum dice you have when you use this Finisher. You can choose to inflict a condition that requires fewer Momentum dice than you expend, but all Momentum dice are expended regardless of the condition selected.
	The target can repeat its saving throw against the condition at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If the condition inflicted is Prone, they do not need to pass a subsequent save and can end the condition by standing as normal instead.
	If the target fails its initial save against the effect, you regain 1 Focus Point.

Breaking Blow:
Momentum Dice | Saving Throw | Condition
1 | Strength | Prone
2 | Constitution | Blinded
3 | Strength | Restrained
4 | Constitution | Stunned
5+ | Constitution | Paralyzed

    <text>When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend all of your Momentum dice to rend a vicious bleeding wound. At the end of each of the creature's turns, it loses hit points equal to the Momentum dice expended. Each time it takes damage from this effect, the number of dice of damage it takes at the end of its next turn is reduced by 1, and the bleeding stops when the number of dice would be reduced to O. A bleeding creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, after taking the damage, ending the effect on a success. The DC of the save is 8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus + half the number of dice remaining, rounded down.
	Applying a new bleed while the target is still bleeding does not stack, but instead refreshes the number of dice of damage taken from the bleed to the higher of the two values.

You can use an action on subsequent turns to keep the portal open and target another creature, which must make the same saving throw. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. While concentrating on this spell, your speed is halved.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, larger asteroids fly through the portal and the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

    <text>You flick your finger against a creature. The target is impacted by a devastating gravitational force and must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 120 feet away from you. The push stops early if the creature hits a solid surface or is pushed into a creature of its size or larger. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
	If the target is pushed into or through the space of a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage is increased by 1d10 per size smaller the creature is than the target.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the target takes an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 30 additional feet for each slot level above 4th.

Note: For example, if a commoner (size Medium) is pushed into a frog (size Tiny), the frog must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. Because the frog is 2 sizes smaller than the commoner, on a failed save, it would take 3d10 damage (the original 1d10 damage, which is increased by 2d10), probably exploding on impact, whilst the commoner would continue its destructive flight unhindered-questioning the laws of physics.

On a failed save, the target takes 8d10 piercing damage and is paralyzed until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn't paralyzed. A creature without a skull is immune to this spell.

    <text>A grim wall of fractured bones appears at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It must rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight, and creatures can't pass through it. The wall is an object, and has AC 15, 150 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points destroys it.
	When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest route and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
	Until the spell ends, and as long as the wall has sufficient hit points, you can use an action to sacrifice 20 hit points from the wall to summon a minotaur skeleton that has murderous killing intent. The creature appears in an unoccupied space of your choice adjacent to the wall. When you summon a minotaur skeleton in this way, designate a creature you can see within 60 feet of it; that creature becomes the sole enemy of the summoned creature. The minotaur skeleton ignores any orders you give, tries to kill its target by any means, and is immune to being charmed. Once its target is dead, it vanishes in a pile of dust.
	You can have a maximum of three creatures summoned by this spell at a time.

A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its limbs to be cut off with this spell. Such a creature takes an extra 5d8 slashing damage instead.

    <text>You touch a point and infuse an area around it with osteomancy. The area can have a radius of up to 120 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect of a boneyard or hallow spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.
	First, you know the exact location and hear the thoughts (if any) of any undead creature within the area, and you know if they are under someone's control.
	Second, all creatures within the area lose resistance and immunity to necrotic and piercing damage.
	Finally, as a reaction whenever a non-undead creature dies within the area, you can choose to rip its skeleton from its flesh and force it to rise again under your control. If you do, the creature is resurrected with 1 hit point, its creature type becomes undead, it becomes immune to all damage, it loses access to any legendary actions it had (if any), and you can mentally command its actions. At the end of its next turn, it dies and cannot be resurrected by any means short of a wish spell.

    <text>You call upon the power of the Great Ones, seeking their guidance. Until the spell ends, you gain the ability to cast any spell from the warlock spell list of 5th level or lower without expending a spell slot or needing to prepare the spell. As part of casting this spell, you can cast a spell with a casting time of an action from your newfound spell list. However, the cost of using this power is steep. At the end of each of your turns, you must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 2d10 psychic damage. If you fail this saving throw two times, the spell ends early and you gain a short-term madness.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, it no longer requires concentration, though you can choose to end the spell whenever.

Short-Term Madness:
When a character is afflicted with short-term madness, roll a d100 on the table below, then roll a d10 to determine the effect of that form of madness. All effects are for the duration of the madness unless specified otherwise.

Short-Term Madness table:

1-10 - Your mind is liberated from any sense of self you may possess:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Without an ego, you are immune to the charmed condition.
3-8 | You mimic the mannerisms, behavior, and speech patterns of the creature closest to you when you gained this madness.
8-10 | Desperate to find yourself again and believing anything, you automatically fail saving throws against being charmed.

11-20 - Your mind is invaded by the sound of the cosmos:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Painful sounds pale in comparison to the cacophony in your head; you are immune to thunder damage.
3-8 | Eldritch utterings scratch your brain; you hear the soft caress of whispers behind your back.
8-10 | The sound of the cosmos drowns out all other noise, closing you to the world. You are deafened and have disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain your concentration.

21-30 - You have seen too much; your mind can't understand it, causing your sight to become erratic and unreliable:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your vision expands as if you are under the effect of the see invisibility spell.
3-8 | Spectral forms flitter at the corners of your eyes, vanishing when you turn your head.
8-10 | You are blinded, and you can't use any special senses you use to see, such as blindsight or tremorsense.

31-40 - The madness inside you bursts forth as haunting screams:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your scream is so loud that it can cause damage. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can scream at a creature you see within 30 feet of you. If the target can hear you, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 1d12 thunder damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success.
3-8 | You can't talk properly; yelling is the only way you can communicate.
8-10 | Your screams are so overwhelming that any creature within 300 feet of you can hear you talk. You also can't form coherent sentences or utter the vocal components of spells.

41-50 - Your posture crumples, as you try to make sense of the insanity before you:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | You become incredibly skittish. When you are the target of an attack or an effect that requires you to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to begin moving evasively, gaining a +1 bonus to AC and advantage on Dexterity saving throws until the start of your next turn.
3-8 | You desperately look for a parental figure that can protect you. Once you find such a person, you latch on to them and refuse to leave their side, no matter what.
8-10 | You fall prone and can't stand, as your legs refuse to obey you, and you can't use any flying speed you possess.

51-60 - You realize that your hands are blasphemous tools:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | These tools can break the minds of your foes. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to it.
3-8 | You refuse to use your hands for anything, keeping them hidden from view. If someone stares at them, it makes you extremely uncomfortable and defensive.
8-10 | You shouldn't touch anything. You drop anything you are holding, and can't hold items or grapple creatures.

61-70 - Your body breaks down under the insanity:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | You are immune to the poisoned condition.
3-8 | You start emitting a foul smell that is unpleasant even to you, and no amount of washing or magic can remove it.
8-10 | You are poisoned, even if you are immune to the condition.

71-80 - The Eldritch Horrors are revealed to you, bathing you in fear:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | When you gain this madness, each creature within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
3-8 | You become paranoid and fearful of any movement or sound.
8-10 | You become frightened of your allies. You must take the Dash action and move away from them by the quickest available route on each of your turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If you start your turn in a location where you can't see any of your allies, you can use your action to end the madness.

81-90 - The madness breaks your mind:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | You realize your mind has been holding back your body, and you can now act freely. You have an additional action on each of your turns. That action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.
3-8 | You burst into spontaneous fits of laughter randomly, even at the most inappropriate times.
8-10 | You are incapacitated. This effect ends early if you take damage equal to twice your level or if a greater restoration spell is cast on you.

91-95 - The revelations from beyond afflict you:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your body ignores all pain; only the Eldritch Truth matters. You are immune to the stunned condition.
3-8 | You speak to others of the Eldritch Truth in a way that seems limpid to you, but is perhaps not so clear to others. Your sentences are cryptic for the unascended mind.
8-10 | You are stunned. This effect ends early if you take damage equal to your level or if a greater restoration spell is cast on you.

96-100 - The beast within you awakens and attempts to take control:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your body releases its animalistic instincts, without the influence of your mind to restrain it. You are under the effect of the haste spell, although it doesn't require concentration. The spell ends when the madness does.
3-8 | Your speech is slurred, as if you're intoxicated, and you punctuate your sentences with animal noises.
8-10 | You fall unconscious, your mind fighting its hardest to not let you become a beast. This effect ends early if you take damage equal to your level or if a greater restoration spell is cast on you.

    <text>You dramatically increase the pull of gravity in a 30-footradius, 300-foot-high cylinder centered on a point on the ground within range. Creatures in this area are knocked prone and cannot lose this condition while there. A creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there is knocked prone and takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage. A flying creature in the area immediately falls to the ground and is knocked prone. A creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw to move or perform any action. Each foot of movement while in the area costs a creature 3 extra feet.
	A prone creature that ends its turn in the cylinder must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced into the ground as gravity pulls it down. It is restrained and incapacitated by the crushing pressure and the ground around it, but it gains the benefits of three-quarters cover, as only the upper part of their body is visible. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, freeing itself from the ground on a success.
	If the spell lasts for its full duration, the ground cracks under the tremendous weight generated and becomes difficult terrain. Each 5-foot-square area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand to remove the difficult terrain.

    <text>When you cast this spell, you create a crack in the world, letting the will of a Great One smother a creature of your choice within range. The direct contact with the eldritch being causes the target to take 8d6 psychic damage, and it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature is pulled in through the tear to the cosmos. On a success, it isn't pulled but gains a long-term madness, and the spell ends.
	While in the cosmos, the target is incapacitated. At the beginning of each of its turns while there, it takes 3d6 cold damage, 3d6 psychic damage, and must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or gain a short-term madness.
	When the spell ends, if the target is still alive, it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. If the creature is killed while in the void, its corpse never returns. A body that disappears in this way can never be recovered, not even with a wish spell.
	If your concentration on the spell ends early, you must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or gain a long-term madness as the eldritch whispers revolt and assault your mind.
	When the spell ends, roll a d100. On a 1, the breach doesn't close and instead only expands, threatening to absorb the entire world.

3-8 | You start emitting a foul smell that is unpleasant even to you, and no amount of washing or magic can remove it.
8-10 | You are poisoned, even if you are immune to the condition.

71-80 - The Eldritch Horrors are revealed to you, bathing you in fear:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | When you gain this madness, each creature within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
3-8 | You become paranoid and fearful of any movement or sound.
8-10 | You become frightened of your allies. You must take the Dash action and move away from them by the quickest available route on each of your turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If you start your turn in a location where you can't see any of your allies, you can use your action to end the madness.

81-90 - The madness breaks your mind:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | You realize your mind has been holding back your body, and you can now act freely. You have an additional action on each of your turns. That action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.
3-8 | You burst into spontaneous fits of laughter randomly, even at the most inappropriate times.
8-10 | You are incapacitated. This effect ends early if you take damage equal to twice your level or if a greater restoration spell is cast on you.

91-95 - The revelations from beyond afflict you:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your body ignores all pain; only the Eldritch Truth matters. You are immune to the stunned condition.
3-8 | You speak to others of the Eldritch Truth in a way that seems limpid to you, but is perhaps not so clear to others. Your sentences are cryptic for the unascended mind.
8-10 | You are stunned. This effect ends early if you take damage equal to your level or if a greater restoration spell is cast on you.

96-100 - The beast within you awakens and attempts to take control:
d10 | Short-Term Madness
1-2 | Your body releases its animalistic instincts, without the influence of your mind to restrain it. You are under the effect of the haste spell, although it doesn't require concentration. The spell ends when the madness does.
3-8 | Your speech is slurred, as if you're intoxicated, and you punctuate your sentences with animal noises.
8-10 | You fall unconscious, your mind fighting its hardest to not let you become a beast. This effect ends early if you take damage equal to your level or if a greater restoration spell is cast on you.

	If the target's spell fails, you can choose to absorb the energy from the interrupted spell, gaining temporary hit points equal to the spell's level that lasts for 1 minute, or copy it, casting the spell immediately as if you were the original caster, and without requiring any material components.

You create a gaseous copy of yourself in an empty space beside you. This copy is indistinguishable from you, even by magical means or abilities such as true sight. The copy has the same stats as you, except for its hit points, as the copy disappears and the spell immediately ends if it takes any damage. The copy has its own turn, which can be immediately before or after your turn. You command what it does (actions, bonus actions, reactions, movement, etc.). It has no resources of its own, such as ammunition, ability uses, or spell slots, so every time it uses something that costs a resource, it uses the resources that you have. For example, if the copy casts a spell, it consumes one of your spell slots as though you had cast the spell yourself. The same principle applies to the use of potions, scrolls, and similar items.
	When you are targeted by an attack, spell, or ability that would damage you, you can instantly switch positions with the copy, which must be within 120 feet of you, so it takes the damage and other effects in your place, causing this spell to end automatically. If the damage dealt to the copy comes from a melee attack, the attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw, becoming stunned for 1 minute on a failure. A creature stunned in this way can make the save again at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success. You and your copy cannot be more than 120 feet apart, if that happens the spell ends automatically and the copy disappears.

As you cast the spell, the gem used as a material component is consumed to bring visions of the target's ancestors, blending them with the target's memories and unlocking new potential within the individual. However, some of the target's memories are lost in the process. The target may choose to change any or all of their subclass, feats, or features, provided they meet the prerequisites for the chosen options. Certain abilities that require additional resources, such as gold, experience points, or training, cannot be chosen unless the target possesses the necessary resources at the time of casting.
	Once the spell is complete, the chosen options are permanent, and they cannot be altered by this spell or similar effects again. The GM may impose restrictions or penalties to reflect the significant impact of the decision.

You create eight plates of pure beryl at points within range of the spell. Each beryl plate is 6 inches thick and 10 feet tall by 10 feet wide. You can distribute the plates in any way you choose within range.
	The plates are perfect squares and can be placed in any position (horizontal or vertical). Any adjacent slabs merge with each other, and each plate can act as a foundation for another, allowing for continuous constructions in any direction, such as bridges or ramps, as long as at least one of the plates is anchored to the earth to be stable.
	A plate cannot occupy the space of a creature or object. If a plate appears in a location occupied by a creature, it is pushed to any side of your choice. If you try to trap a creature between the plates, the creature can make a Dexterity saving throw and position itself outside on a success.
	Each plate has an AC of 16 and 180 hit points, disappearing magically if reduced to 0, possibly causing the collapse of adjacent plates at the GM's discretion.
	As a bonus action, you can dispense the plates at any time during the spell. If you maintain concentration for the entire duration of the spell, you can choose to keep the plates permanently, but they will turn into plates of slightly greenish rock, without any value other than stone. If you choose not to keep the plates permanently or lose concentration before the end of the spell, the plates disappear magically without a trace.

You cast a small spark at a point within range and then it explodes into a wave of confusion in a 10-foot-radius sphere. All creatures in the area must make a Wisdom saving throw or become extremely disoriented on a failure.
	An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.
	At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

Confusion Behavior:
d10 | Behavior
1 | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn.
2-6 | The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.
7-8 | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.
9-10 | The creature can act and move normally.

You create a square area immune to dispel magic, with a side of 60 feet, having one of the vertices at a point within the range of the spell.
	While within the area of the spell, all allied creatures, when making attack rolls and saving throws, can roll 1d4 and add the result to their roll, have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, and any healing they receive within the area will consider results of 1 or 2 on the dice as 3. Hostile creatures within the area that make an attack or saving throw must roll 1d4 and subtract the value from the roll.
	Creatures within the area cannot be targeted by divination spells. The blessing also crosses planes, preventing any ethereal travel within the area and preventing extraplanar creatures from being summoned or conjured within the area.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 30-foot cone and deals 11d6 acid damage.

You manifest a series of flowers in the space you occupy, which immediately grow and bloom, releasing their pollen in a circular area with a 20-foot radius centered on you. Any charm or frightening effect affecting a creature in the area ends immediately. Additionally, any creature hostile towards you or your allies within the area must make a Charisma saving throw, and on a failure, they become indifferent to you and your allies until the end of the spell or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it.

When you cast this spell, a flame that rises from your feet covers your entire body, increasing your speed and strength momentarily. As part of this spell, you can immediately move 40 feet in any direction you choose. During this movement, you can push objects up to five times your normal capacity (or 150 times your Strength score in pounds). If you collide with a creature, the movement ends, and the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 40 feet back and fall prone. If the creature's movement is interrupted by obstacles, it will fall prone and suffer 4d6 bludgeoning damage in addition. If the path is blocked by another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, suffering the same damage and falling prone on a failure.

You cause the eyes of a creature within range to glow like blazing embers. During the spell's duration, the target gains proficiency with Charisma (Intimidation). If it already has this proficiency, the target doubles its proficiency bonus on Charisma (Intimidation) checks, and those checks are made with advantage. Additionally, any creature that the target damages has disadvantage on its next attack roll against the target until the start of the target's next turn.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge deals fire damage, and on the damage roll, consider any result of 1 or 2 as a 3.

You magically create a glowing dust and blow it into a Burst of Embers that illuminates everything it covers. Any creature in the area that fails a Dexterity saving throw will be covered by this glowing dust for the duration of the spell. For the duration, covered creatures and objects shed dim light in a 10-foot radius. Any attack roll against a covered creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.

You can bring your allies to assist you. When casting the spell, choose up to four willing creatures. As long as they are within 1 mile of you, each of these creatures can be teleported from their locations to an unoccupied space closest to you. If there isn't enough free space for the creature to be within 10 feet of you, or if you are somehow unreachable, the creatures will know they were called but won't be able to teleport.
	Objects carried by the creatures are teleported along with them, but other creatures that were being carried are not.

Optionally, you can transform the effect into an aura, affecting willing creatures of your choice within 20 feet of you, but you must concentrate to maintain the spell in this way.

You choose a point on the ground within range and then a large rune appears there, emitting a cylindrical mystical barrier with a 10-foot radius and 30 feet in height. No spell of 5th level or lower cast outside the barrier affects creatures or objects within it, even if cast at higher levels. Creatures within the area can be targeted by spells, but do not suffer their effects, and area spells have their effects suppressed within the cylinder.
	You can also, as a reaction, deflect a spell of 3rd level or lower cast against a target within the barrier. Then you choose another creature within range but outside the area to be the target. If you do so, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a slot of 7th level or higher, you block spells of up to 6th level and can deflect a spell of up to 4th level.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 30-foot cone and deals 10d6 acid damage plus 1d6 acid damage for each slot level above 6th.

You point to a creature within range and place a magical command in its mind. The command forces the creature to perform some task or abstain from some action or to take a course of activity as you decide. The creature must understand you to be affected, and if it does, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. Whenever the charmed creature takes actions against its will, it takes 1 level of exhaustion, but no more than 1 level per day. A creature that doesn't understand you is immune to this spell.
	You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. If you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.
	You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 7th-level or 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.

You create an illusion of an object, creature, or other visible phenomenon as if you had cast the major image spell. But when the image is attacked or comes into contact with a creature, it explodes into a burst of air affecting a 20-foot radius sphere. Creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 3d8 thunder damage, are deafened, and are thrown 80 feet in the opposite direction of the explosion. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage, is not deafened, and is thrown 20 feet.
	A deafened creature must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn, ending the deafened condition on a success. A thrown creature that has their movement impeded takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet they are unable to move. If they are obstructed by another creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking the same damage on a failed save or no damage on a success.

You conjure an earth guardian, with the same appearance as the figurine used, that emerges from the ground in an empty 10-foot cube. Use the stat block of an earth elemental to characterize the guardian, which will remain for the duration of the spell or until reduced to 0 hit points, disappearing magically when the spell ends.
	The guardian obeys you to the best of its ability and acts after you in the initiative order. You can give simple courseof-action commands, such as attacking a target or running in a direction, as a free action. If you want to give a command the size of a phrase, you must spend a bonus action. If you lose concentration, the guardian will continue to follow the last command until completed. If the guardian completes the action and cannot hear or obtain new commands, it will use the Dodge action and preserve itself as best as possible.
	You can use an action to regain concentration on this spell a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge infuses your guardian with energy, allowing it to use an action to cast the elemental surge cantrip as if it were you, only once during the spell's duration, dealing 5d6 acid damage.

If the creature is casting a spell of 4th level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 5th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.
	If this effect causes a spell to fail, a creature within range regains a number of hit points equal to 2d8 per spell's level.

Circles of hot and dry winds surround the targeted creature of this spell, creating a strong wind area with a 10-foot radius around it, granting a +2 bonus to AC and imposing disadvantage on ranged attack rolls made against it. Hostile creatures that start their turn or enter the area must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed out of the area on a failed save.
	During the target's turn, it can use a bonus action to make a ranged spell attack against a creature within 30 feet. If the attack hits, it deals 1d12 bludgeoning damage, and the attacked target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed back 20 feet and fall prone; on a success, it is pushed back 10 feet and remain standing. If there is an obstacle in the way of the pushed creature, it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was pushed, and if the obstacle is another creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes the same damage and also fall prone.
	In addition, if a creature is targeted by an attack and the attacker or the target is within 30 feet of the area of this spell, the target can take a reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack by sending a gust of wind towards it.

You touch a creature, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. The cursed creature feels terrible pain as if it were being burned. Every time you deal damage to the cursed creature, it takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. Additionally, at the start of its turns, the cursed creature must make a Constitution saving throw, and on a failure, the creature feels intense pain and wastes its action of that turn doing nothing.

You create a protective barrier in a point of your choice within range, forming a 5-foot-radius circular shield with 2 inches of thickness, made of dust and shimmering energy. The shield has 1d10+10 hit points and provides cover to you and any creatures directly behind it. If the shield hit points reaches 0 it is destroyed, ending the spell.
	While the spell is active, as a bonus action, you can move the shield up to 20 feet in any direction, and even shift it's orientation between vertical and horizontal, but you must remain within 30 feet of it or the spell will end. The shield will block any physical attacks or spells that would pass through it, as any solid barrier, but will not protect against area-of-effect spells or attacks that bypass physical objects.
	In addition, the shield may be used to carry objects up to 50 pounds or activate traps.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the shield's hit points increase by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.

You are imbued with the breath of a brass dragon, releasing this breath upon casting and choosing one of the two breaths below:

Fire Breath: You spit out a 60-foot line of fire with a width of 5 feet. Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 13d6 fire damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success.

Sleep Breath: You exhale a sleep-inducing gas in a 60-foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends if the creature takes damage or another creature uses an action to wake it.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 45-foot cone area, and if you have used the fire breath, you use the sleep breath, but creatures in the area will sleep for 5 minutes. If you have used the sleep breath, you can do a 8d6 fire damage breath, which does not awaken affected creatures.

You alter the gravity around up to six creatures of your choice within a 40-foot square within range. Each creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be affected by the spell for the duration.
	An affected creature has difficulty moving and suffers a penalty of -2 to its AC and to its Dexterity and Strength saving throws. Its movement and actions are limited (see below), allowing it to use only half of its movement and only an action or a bonus action on the same turn. The creature cannot maintain concentration on spells and if it attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw; otherwise, the spell fails.

Limited Actions: The targets of the spell have limited but not prevented actions. If a creature wants to take a reaction, or use both its action and bonus action, or use its entire movement, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a success, it can use the chosen option as usual but suffers one level of exhaustion. On a failure, the creature only performs what this spell allows and suffers one level of exhaustion from the effort.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge deals 3d6 acid damage, and if it hits a creature under the effect of earth embrace, it takes double damage.

You tap into the energy of the earth and are able to perform the following tricks. For this spell, the term earth includes sand, soil, stone, and similar terrains.

	• You can create a small, harmless tremor that extends up to 15 feet in radius and lasts for 1 minute. This can be useful for creating distractions or triggering traps.

	• You can move the earth underneath an object that weighs up to 15 pounds, causing it to move up to 5 feet in any unoccupied direction. This can be helpful for moving small objects or creating obstacles.

	• You can create a small earth construct with an AC of 11, 10 hit points, and 15 feet of movement, up to 25 feet away from you. You can telepathically command the construct to perform simple tasks, such as carrying an object weighing up to 20 pounds. Note that the construct cannot make attacks and will dissolve after 10 minutes or when its hit points are reduced to 0.

You choose a creature that you can see and that is not native to the Material Plane and trap it within the earth. The chosen creature must make a Charisma saving throw or be swallowed by the earth, becoming trapped in a state of suspended animation underground until released.
	A trapped creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the creature accumulates 3 successes, it is freed, but is banished back to its original plane of existence. If it fails 3 times (including the initial one), the creature will remain trapped until it is released by another creature.
	A creature trapped for less than 1001 days that is unearthed exits the state of suspended animation and returns to its plane. A creature that has been trapped for more than 1001 days, when unearthed, is freed from the effects of the spell, but if it dies on the Material Plane within the next 1001 years, it will die permanently and not return to its plane of origin. After these subsequent 1001 days, the creature is free of any effects of this spell. You can release a trapped creature at any time with an action, as long as you are on the same plane of existence.

You make the entire ground tremble in a 60-foot radius centered on you. A number of creatures of your choice, equal to your Wisdom modifier, that you can see within range, are swallowed by the ground, falling into a huge earth maze. Each of the creatures is sent to a different maze, so they can't find each other. To escape the maze, the creature must accumulate 3 successes in Wisdom checks, each of which must be made with their action at the beginning of their next turns. The DC of the Wisdom checks is equal to your spell save DC. For each failure, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage from small cave-ins in the tunnels. A minotaur or other creature with the Labyrinthine Recall special trait (or a similar one) automatically succeeds on this check.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide and deals 12d6 acid damage.

When you touch a silk scarf to a surface of rock or earth, you create a shelter for up to eight people. The entrance marked by the scarf can only be seen by those you designate and is invisible to others. Inside the 20-foot cube shelter is dry, has a comfortable climate, and a small crystal provides illumination that can be turned on or off with a word from anyone chosen. At the end of the spell, you can cast it again to maintain the same shelter, otherwise the spell ends. You can use an action to end the spell at any time, and when the spell ends, the void created fills and expels anything inside it out of it. The volume of available rock or earth must be compatible with the size of the shelter created, otherwise the spell fails.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge imbue the entrance with elemental energy, so that once during the spell's duration, when an undesired person enters the earth shelter, they must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d6 acid damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

You ignite the flames of rage in a creature you can see within range, forcing the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, for the duration of the spell, the creature becomes frenzied and will always attack its nearest creature. If there are no creatures within reach, the affected creature will spend its entire turn moving to the nearest creature. The affected creature is also immune to the frightened and charmed conditions and cannot use spells or any spellcasting abilities, only making armed and unarmed attacks. Additionally, all of its attack rolls will have advantage, but all attack rolls against the affected creature will also have advantage.
	The affected creature can make a new saving throw at the beginning of its turns to break free of the effect on a success. If it has taken any damage since the end of its last turn, it will make the save with disadvantage.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge creates a burst, which affects a 10-foot radius circle centered on you and deals 5d6 fire damage.

    <text>With an action, you release pure elemental energy from your hands in a 15-foot cone. You deal 1d6 damage of your primary elemental type, as shown on the table below. All creatures within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking only half damage on a successful save.
	You can also focus all energy on a ray. In this case, you make a ranged spell attack with a range of 60 feet and deal the same damage that it would deal in a cone (or other shapes),
even if empowered by Elemental Flux:

Cantrip Upgrade: This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

Primary Elemental Types:
Primary Element | Damage Type
Air | Thunder
Earth | Acid
Fire | Fire

At Higher Levels: With this special cantrip, you can expend one of your spell slots to increase the damage it deals. The extra damage added depends on the level of the spell slot used, as shown on the table below. If you use a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, the range of the spell's area of effect doubles (30-foot cone) and if you use a 7th-level or higher spell slot, the range triples (45-foot cone).

You commune with the element of air, and it answers your call. You can determine how the winds of up to 5 miles will behave, accelerating or stopping them. Each round that you accelerate or stop the winds, the winds in the area increase or decrease one stage on the Wind table:

Ether Confluence:

In addition, as a bonus action, you can cause a strong gust of wind to blow in a direction of your choosing, affecting a 120 square feet area. Any creatures that start their turn or enter the area must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 40 feet in the direction of the wind and be knocked prone. A creature whose movement is impeded by obstructed spaces, such as walls or objects two size categories larger, takes 1d6 damage for every 10 feet it moved before having its movement impeded. If you choose to have the wind blow against the ground or a creature that cannot move due to a wall or other obstructed space caused by large or larger objects, a creature that fails the saving throw is knocked prone and restrained until the beginning of its next turn.

You can create or manipulate fire to produce one of the following effects:

	• You create a magic flame in your hand, which can take any form but can't be larger than 1 cubic foot. You can absorb non-magical flames within a range of 60 feet, extinguishing 5 feet of them, and transforming the flame in your hand into a magical and harmless source of light that sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

	• You can ignite an object or space up to 5 cubic feet in size, illuminating your surroundings. The flames can only be extinguished if you command them to do so or if they are covered by at least 1 liter of water from a magical source. You can create as many magic flames as you wish.

	• You can make the flames take on simple shapes, such as the vague form of a creature or object, and animate them as desired, providing a fun and useful way to create illusions or entertain others.

You point the gem at a creature you can see within range and cast a fiery-looking ray from your forehead, which pierces through obstacles and reaches the creature's mind. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a success, the creature falls unconscious and wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature uses an action to wake it. On a failure, the creature's Intelligence and Wisdom are reduced to 1. The affected creature can't cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way, but it can still identify its friends, follow them, and protect them. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, and if it succeeds three times, it will overcome the effects of the spell. However, if it fails three times, including the first, it will be permanently affected by the spell.
	The effects of this spell can be ended by a heal, greater restoration, wish, or any similar spell or ability.

You attempt to create magical, non-burning chains around the limbs of a creature of your choice that you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it fails, the shackles form and it will be charmed for the duration. If an ally or friendly creature is fighting against the target, it has advantage on the saving throw.
	While the chains remain on the target, you have telepathic communication with it and always know where it is, even on another plane, and it will obey your commands to the best of its ability. You can give commands of simple courses of action, such as attacking a target or running in a direction, as a free action. If you want to give an order of a sentence length, you must use a bonus action. If the creature completes the action and receives no new commands, it will use the action to defend and preserve itself as best as it can.
	If you or one of your allies deals damage to the creature, it may repeat the saving throw, ending the spell on a success.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide and deals 12d6 fire damage plus 1d6 fire damage for each slot level above 8th.

You try to awaken the warmth of friendship within another person. Choose a humanoid that you can see within range and that can clearly see and hear you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge deals fire damage, affects a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide, and deals an extra 1d6 fire damage for each 2 slot levels above 1st.

You manipulate the earth, opening a fissure within range, starting at a point you can see. The fissure occupies a line 50 feet long and 10 feet wide. Within the line, a chasm opens up to a depth of 20 feet, and creatures within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they fall into the chasm. The terrain inside the fissure is considered difficult, and its walls are sandy, making any Strength (Athletics) check to climb it to be rolled against your Spell Save DC.
	Starting at your next turn, you can close the fissure as an action. Creatures still inside it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d12 force damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. Until the start of your next turn after closing the fissure, it is not fully sealed, and a creature trapped inside the fissure has total cover but is restrained and can use their action to make a Strength saving throw. On a success, they can use their full movement to try to climb out, ending the condition when they leave the fissure, but for every 1 foot of movement required, they must spend an additional 1 foot, emerging in an adjacent space to the fissure if the movement is sufficient. On a failure, they cannot move. At the start of the next turn after the fissure is closed, it is fully sealed, and all creatures still inside it are incapacitated and have their movement reduced to 0. Creatures with burrowing movement are immune to the effects of closing the fissure. The fissure closes automatically at the end of the spell or if you lose concentration.

Elemental Flux: With your next elemental surge, you stomp the ground. All creatures in a 20-foot radius circle centered on you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 10d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.

You cause your body to alter its composition, becoming a flaming form, but without changing your AC. Anything you are carrying, of your choice, shifts along with your body and you gain the following characteristics:

	• You can pass through spaces as small as an inch, but moving 1 foot costs 2 feet of speed;

	• You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet;

	• Creatures that touch you, make a melee attack against you, start or enter a space within 5 feet of you, take 1d10 fire damage;

	• You become immune to fire and poison damage, resistant to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from non magical attacks, and immune to the grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and restrained conditions;

	• Your unarmed and weapon attacks deal an extra 2d10 fire damage.

	• You have advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws and ability checks.

At any time, as a bonus action, you can end the spell, returning your body and everything you are carrying to its normal state.

You ignite your spirit with flames, emitting an aura that generates adoration or fear in a specific type of creature around you. You choose a type of intelligent creature as the target of this spell, and all of those within range are affected according to the chosen aura as follows:

Frightful Aura: This aura causes the chosen creatures within range to feel fear. Each creature of the chosen type that starts its turn or enters the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for the duration of the spell. A creature that succeeds the saving throw is immune to the effect for 1 minute. While frightened, the creature uses its movement to reach the safest place possible where it cannot see you and is out of range. When it is out of range and can no longer see you, the creature is no longer frightened. If the creature re-enters the range or can see you again, it becomes frightened once more. Whenever a creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Adoration Aura: This aura causes all chosen creatures within range to adore you as a revered entity. Each creature of the chosen type that starts its turn or enters the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the spell's duration. A creature that succeeds the saving throw is immune to the effect for 1 minute. A charmed creature approaches you as closely as possible and will adore you in the best way its culture or customs would venerate a figure of respect, as determined by the GM. Whenever a creature can no longer see you and is more than 60 feet away from you, it is free from the effect, but will become affected again if it sees you or is within 60 feet of you once more. If a creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

All creatures you choose within the spell's range and that can see you must make a Charisma saving throw. A target automatically succeeds the saving throw if it is immune to the frightened condition. On a failure, the target is affected by the spell. Until the end of the spell's duration, you can, as a bonus action, specify a location that is not occupied by a creature where the creatures will believe that blazing flames are erupting, emitting extreme heat. At the start of their turns, each affected target within 30 feet of the chosen point must move away from the heat source at all its speed before taking any other actions. A creature that is forced to move by this effect may repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, freeing itself from the effect on a success. A creature that does not move for any reason remains frightened until it moves away. A creature will not walk to a location that is obviously a mortal danger, such as a cliff, but it may provoke opportunity attacks during its movements.

You amplify the flames of leadership within you. For the duration of the spell, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion, Deception, and Intimidation) checks. Once during the spell's duration, you can give a one-word simple command to a creature within 60 feet, which must make a Wisdom saving throw, following the command on a failure. The command has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it. After following the command, all other effects of the spell end. Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the spell ends.

Approach: The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

Drop: The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

Flee: The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

Grovel: The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

Halt: The target doesn't move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, for the duration of the spell, you gain an extra use of the command for every 2 slot levels above 2nd that you use. The bonus to ability checks granted by this spell only ends when the last use of the command is used.

You focus the energy of an area spell or effect that deals damage onto a single creature of your choice that was originally targeted by that spell or effect. The chosen creature must be within range of the spell or effect, and you must have a clear line of sight to it.
	The chosen creature takes an additional 1d6 damage of the same type as the original spell or effect, and the DC of any saving throws it makes against the spell or effect increases by 2.
	For example, if a fireball is about to detonate in a 20-foot radius around you and other creatures, you can use focused blast to redirect the full force of the fireball only to that creature. The target makes its saving throw as usual, but the original DC is increased by 2. If it fails, it takes an additional 1d6 of fire damage.
	You must have a clear line of sight to both the caster and the chosen creature. If you do not have a clear line of sight to either of these, the spell fails. This spell does not allow you to target a creature that was not in the original affected area.

This image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration.

You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature.
	As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.
	Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation)
check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.

You create a strong wind from a point of your choice within range, forming a 60-foot long, 10-foot wide, and 20-foot tall line that blows in the direction of your choice for the duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet in the direction of the wind and be knocked prone. Any creature standing in the line must spend an extra 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves in the direction against the wind.
	The gust also disperses gas or vapor and extinguishes unprotected flames such as candles or torches in the area, while protected flames like lanterns dance wildly and have a 50%
chance of being extinguished.
	As a bonus action, you can change the direction of the wind or move the starting point of the wind.

You control the winds to create a protective barrier of up to 20-foot radius at a point within the spell's range. Creatures inside the barrier receive the following benefits:

	• Ranged weapon attacks made against these creatures by creatures outside the barrier are made with disadvantage;

	• Ranged weapon attacks made by these creatures within the barrier against creatures outside the barrier are made with advantage;

	• Allied creatures inside the barrier receive a bonus of 5 feet to their movement and do not provoke opportunity attacks when moving within it;

	• A hostile creature attempting to enter the barrier must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have its movement interrupted and remain outside the barrier.

You alter the target's body composition, turning it into a living granite statue. The shape of the granite body is similar to the original form, being composed purely of granite and gaining the following characteristics:

	• Its AC becomes 17 + Constitution modifier and cannot be lowered to less than 17;

	• It becomes immune to poison damage, and resistant to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and immune to the poisoned, paralyzed, and petrified conditions;

	• It gains tremorsense of 60 feet;

	• It gains claws capable of digging through non-magical and unworked stone and earth, with a burrowing speed equal to its walking speed;

	• Its unarmed strikes now deal 2d10 + Strength modifier bludgeoning damage and are considered magical;

	• It has advantage on Strength and Constitution ability checks and saving throws.

While it remains motionless, the target is indistinguishable from an ordinary statue.

You greatly increase the effect of gravity on a creature that you can see within range. The target creature is not prevented from taking actions, but using its movement, an action, or a bonus action requires a herculean effort, causing the creature to take 2d12 force damage and suffer one level of exhaustion for each action taken. In addition, attacks that deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage deal double damage to the creature.
	For the duration of the spell, at the start of each turn, the target creature may make a Strength saving throw, and if successful, it is free from the effects of the spell for that turn, but it still retains all exhaustion levels gained from previous failures. If the target's Strength score is 10 or less, it automatically fails the saving throw.

You stomp the ground with incredible force, creating a massive shockwave that travels through the earth. Each creature in contact with the ground and within a 90-foot cone from you is pushed back in the opposite direction from you. They are pushed away until they leave the area of the spell.
	Each creature that is moved in this way must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they fall prone and take 1d8 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet they were pushed away. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw take half damage and are not knocked prone, but still are pushed away from you.

Elemental Flux: With your next elemental surge, you stomp the ground. All creatures in a 30-foot radius circle centered on you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw taking 11d6 bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone on a failed save.

You decide how they look, including height, weight, facial features, tone of voice, hair length, coloring, and distinctive features, if any. They can resemble a member of another species, although none of their statistics change, but you can choose one racial trait to grant to the transformed creatures. They also cannot resemble a creature of a different size, and their basic shape remains the same; if you are bipedal, you cannot use this spell to become quadrupedal, for example. At any time during the spell's duration, the affected creature can use its action to revert its appearance to normal, ending the effect on it.

Each one must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you. A creature frightened in this way must use its actions to move as far away from you as possible via the safest available route, unless it can't move. If it moves to a spot that is at least 60 feet away from you, it is no longer frightened. If the creature can't move, it must make another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn.

Creatures that start their turn or enter the area, except for the caster and three creatures of their choice, must make a Strength saving throw or be sucked into the tornado.
	Flying creatures in the area must make the Strength saving throw with disadvantage, and flying creatures within 30 feet of the tornado must make a Strength saving throw to avoid being sucked into it. Unattended objects and items are also sucked into the tornado. Flying creatures can make another Strength saving throw, with disadvantage, at the beginning of their turn, freeing themselves from the effects until the start of their next turn.
	Creatures that are sucked into the tornado are pulled towards the center of the cylinder and lifted 40 feet in the air each turn. They are trapped in the tornado for the duration, considered incapacitated with a speed of 0.
	Buildings in the area take 20 points of bludgeoning damage at the start of your turns. If their hit points are reduced to 0, they are turned into debris and also sucked into the tornado.
	When the spell ends, each creature and object that was caught in the tornado is thrown 100 feet away in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face.
	If a creature is thrown in the same direction as debris from a building, it must make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being crushed under the rubble. A creature hit by debris takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage.

You carefully create a powerful glyph on a surface, which can be a wall, table, throne, book cover, shield, etc., as long as it has a surface area of 1 foot in diameter. If you choose a surface that conceals the glyph, the spell will not take effect.
	The glyph is apparent and bright and clearly magical. While you cast the spell, you must set a trigger that you desire for the glyph's effect, such as touching or stepping on the glyph or the approach of a certain type of creature within 5 feet of it.
	When the glyph is activated, choose one of the following effects:

Disintegration: The glyph destroys the object or location where it was placed, heating it to the point of disintegrating everything within a 10-foot radius around it. A creature that touches the object or is in the area being disintegrated must make a Constitution saving throw, reducing its hit points to 0 and turning to dust on a failure or taking 6d8 radiant damage and 6d8 fire damage on a success.

Self-Destruction: The glyph self-destructs in a powerful explosion. All creatures within a 60-foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 40d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Eternal Heat: The glyph emits a lot of heat. For the next 1001 days, any creature that starts its turn or enters a space within 30 feet of the glyph takes 4d8 fire damage, and creatures that are beyond these 30 feet but within 60 feet of the glyph must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failure.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 45-foot cone and deals 14d6 fire damage.

	On a failed save, the creature takes 3d6 fire damage and has its walking speed, or any other speed that relies on contact with the ground, halved for a minute or until it takes an action to cool its feet outside the area. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and avoids the speed reduction.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 10-foot-radius circle centered on you. All creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. Targets take 7d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The creature cannot have been dead for more than 10 days and revives with 1 hit point, free of any curses or conditions (except for exhaustion, which only recovers 1 level) that affected it at the time of its death. This spell does not restore lost parts and does not affect undead or constructs, or creatures whose soul does not want to resurrect, or creatures that have died from old age.

You forge a powerful connection between two willing creatures of your choice within range, causing them to instantly swap their current hit points and maximum hit points. If a creature's hit points drop to 0 as a result of the swap, that creature falls unconscious and begins dying.
	In addition to the hit point swap, the two creatures can choose to exchange any of the following effects, provided both creatures agree:

Condition Swap: Choose one of the following conditions: blinded, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned. If one of the creatures is currently affected by the chosen condition, that creature is cured of the condition and the other creature becomes affected by it. This exchange lasts until the spell ends, at which point the conditions return to the originally affected creature.

Skill Swap: The two creatures choose one skill, tool, or language proficiency each and exchange the chosen proficiency for the duration of the spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration of the condition swap and skill swap increases by 1 extra hour for each slot level above 3rd.

Elemental Flux: If used for the duration of the spell, but before any other spell is cast, your next elemental surge deals 5d6 cold damage or grants 5d6 temporary hit points to creatures of your choice within the area of effect.

You gain the ability to teleport up to your speed, but every 5 feet of distance teleported spends 5 feet of your speed for the current turn (you must have at least 10 feet of movement remaining for the spell to work). You must teleport to a destination within your line of sight. For example, you could teleport to the top of a wall, but not to a point in mid-air unless you have a means of flight. When you teleport, you leave behind a trail of lightning that damages any creatures in its path.
	All creatures in a line between your starting point and your destination must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 5d8 lightning damage. On a successful save, they take half as much damage.

You weave together strands of lightning into an invisible tunnel that can be up to 120 feet long and 5 feet in diameter. The tunnel remains stationary once created and lasts for the duration of the spell.
	Each round, the first creature or object that enters one end of the tunnel becomes an invisible and silent electrical charge that instantly travels through the tunnel to the other end, reforming in its original form. Creatures and objects that pass through the sides of the tunnel take no damage and are unaffected by the spell.
	However, when a creature is transported through the tunnel, any other creatures standing inside the tunnel's area take 2d6 lightning damage as the energy arcs through them. This damage has no visible source, and creatures that are transported through the tunnel are immune to it.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the length of the tunnel increases by 30 feet and the diameter increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

You create a barrier that looks like a net of pure energy. The barrier does not need to be sustained and can float in the air. It occupies an area of 60 feet in length, 20 feet in height, and one inch in thickness. Any creature within the area where the barrier was created must make a Strength saving throw, suffering 3d8 lightning damage on a failure and being thrown 10 feet in a direction of your choice. On a successful save, the target takes only half the damage and is expelled into the nearest free space, as chosen by the affected creature.
	The barrier magnetically affects an area of 15 feet around it. Inside this area, attacks made with metal weapons have disadvantage, and creatures made of metal or wearing metal armor move at half speed (moving 1 foot costs 2 feet of speed).
	A creature can attempt to pass through the barrier but must succeed on a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes 3d8 lightning damage and is thrown back 10 feet in a prone condition. On a success, it takes half damage and passes through the barrier.

You encase a touched creature with a barrier of lava, shielding it from attacks. For the duration, the creature is resistant to fire and cold damage. If the creature takes bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage from a creature adjacent to it, the barrier spews lava at the attacking creature, which must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d8 fire damage.
	Optionally, the creature protected by the barrier can take a reaction upon being hit by a melee attack to make the barrier explode, causing every creature within 15 feet, except itself, to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, creatures hit by the barrier take 6d8 fire damage. After using this reaction, the spell ends.

	Furthermore, when a spell is cast within the area or affects any space within it, you can choose to absorb the magic to fuel the precipitation. The absorbed magic has no effect, and the precipitation then heals your chosen allied creatures within the rain for an amount of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell slot used to cast the absorbed spell.

You touch an object, causing it to emit a faint glow that is imperceptible in bright light and difficult to notice in dim light conditions. The object can be any item (magical or not) of your choosing, weighing no more than 10 pounds.
	While the spell is active, you can sense the location of the object as long as it is within 240 feet of you, even if it is behind walls, doors, or other barriers. The location is communicated to you as a general sense of direction (e.g., "northwest") and distance (e.g., "close", "very far").
	You can dismiss the spell at any time as a bonus action, causing the glow to fade immediately.
	The DC to notice the glow is equal to your spell save DC. Only a creature specifically looking for the glow can use its action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check against this DC to notice the glow. The object can be hidden inside fabrics or other objects, making it impossible to directly see the glow, without hindering your ability to sense its location.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the weight limit of the object increases by 10 pounds for each slot level above 1st.

You surround a target creature within range with a thin layer of clean water, granting it the ability to breathe underwater and a swimming speed of 40 feet. While the spell lasts, the creature gains the following benefits:

	• Immunity to the effects of non-magical fire, gasses and liquids, including harmful acids, poisons and smokes.

	• You have advantage on saving throws made against harmful magic gasses (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, and the breath weapons of some dragons).

	• Resistance to fire and acid damage.

	• Immunity to being grappled and restrained.

The water mantle continuously replenishes the water the creature breathes and is covered in, filtering out harmful substances.
	In addition, the creature can use a bonus action to end the spell and unleash a water gust attack against a creature within 60 feet. The water gust requires a ranged spell attack roll and deals 3d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge deals 7d6 cold damage.

You touch a creature and a seismic wave emanates from your fingers, enveloping it and imposing a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is restrained and its skin begins to turn to marble. On a success, the creature is unaffected. A creature with its skin turned to marble must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the creature accumulates three successes, it is free from the condition and the spell ends. If it accumulates three failures
(including the initial one), the creature becomes petrified.

You ignite the spirit of a group of people by suggesting a course of action (limited to up to two sentences). You magically influence, at your discretion, a number of people equal to up to three times your proficiency bonus. The creatures must be able to see and hear you clearly and the suggestion must be phrased in a way that makes the course of action reasonable. Igniting them to do something against themselves, such as self-flagellation, negates the effects of the magic.
	Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect.
	Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they pursue the course of action you described to the best of their ability.
	For the duration of the spell, the inflamed creatures are immune to the frightened condition and will continue to carry out the proposed course of action. If the activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the target finishes what was requested.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge creates a burst around you, which affects a 20-foot radius circle centered on you and deals 10d6 fire damage plus 1d6 fire damage for each slot level above 6th.

You choose the stat block of a non-spellcaster creature with a CR of up to 12, then you create a dense air replica of that creature, within an unoccupied space that you can see within the spell's range. The replica uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates, except that any damage dealt by the replica is psychic damage. However, the replica can only damage or affect in other ways creatures that failed the saving throw. It acts on its own turn and on its own initiative, but you can control its course of action. If the replica's hit points are reduced to 0, the spell ends, and it immediately dissipates.

You choose an area of rock and change its internal heat, melting it into lava. You affect a 40-foot cube of rock within range. The lava flows and ignites any flammable materials it touches. A creature that touches the lava takes 2d8 fire damage.
	If a creature has a limb or body part covered by lava, it takes this damage at the end of its turns for the next minute or until it takes an action to remove the lava. A creature that is partially covered by lava has its speed halved and takes 4d8 fire damage for the next minute or until it takes an action to remove the lava. A creature that is completely covered by the lava is restrained, takes 8d8 fire damage, and requires 2 actions to completely remove the lava, but if it spends only 1 action, it is still considered to be partially covered by lava.

At Higher Levels: When you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you melt an extra 20-foot cube of rock per level above 5th.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 30-foot cone and deals 8d6 fire damage plus 1d6 fire damage for each slot above 5th.

You hold the piece of metal used in this spell and it disintegrates into metallic sand, swirling around a willing creature within range of the spell, granting them protection. A creature enveloped in this protection gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, is considered to have half cover, and when subjected to a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage from an effect, they take no damage on a success.

The duplicate has an AC equal to yours and one hit point, and it performs saving throws and ability checks as it were you. The duplicate does not move, but any action you take can also be simulated by the duplicate at your choice. A creature can make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to realize that the duplicate is not real. The duplicate disappears if you use a bonus action to dismiss it, if you move more than 60 feet away from it, or when its hit points are reduced to 0.

You manipulate earth and rocks to create objects within range. If using fresh earth (sand, clay, and general soils), you can create a large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), such as statues, bridges, passages, pillars, doors, etc., as long as there is enough earth to do so. If using metal or solid rock,.you can create only a medium or smaller object (contained within a single 5-foot cube), such as a weapon, idol, crown, etc. The objects are usually solid, without gears or hinges, and generally of good quality. However, the quality of objects, such as jewelry, statues, or any that require artistic or professional knowledge, may vary depending on your proficiency or the availability of the right tools.

At Higher Levels: When you use a spell slot of 5th or 6th level, you can make a huge object of fresh earth (contained within a 15-foot cube, or twenty seven connected 5-foot cubes) or a large object of solid material (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes). When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can mold a gargantuan object of fresh earth (contained within a 20-foot cube, or four connected 10-foot cubes, or sixty-four connected 5-foot cubes).

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide and deals 7d6 acid damage plus 1d6 acid damage for each slot level above 4th.

    <text>Element: Water

You touch a non-magical object weighing no more than 5 pounds, causing its surface to become reflective like a mirror. During the spell's duration, the object captures all images and sounds within a 30-foot radius, as long as they are reflected on its mirrored surface.
	When the spell ends, the object reverts to its original state, and the captured images and sounds are retained, hidden within it. To access the captured images and sounds, the object must be submerged in any body of water large enough to completely cover it. Once the object is submerged, the captured images and sounds are displayed on the surface of the water and can be viewed as if you were on the location. The size of the water surface determines the size of the image, with a larger surface allowing for more details to be seen.
	The object can store the captured images and sounds for up to 1 year. However, once the object is submerged and the images and sounds are accessed, or if it is removed from the water before the end of it, the information is lost and cannot be recovered.
	The quality of the captured images and sounds depends on the quality of the object used as a mirror. Polished and well-maintained objects capture clearer and sharper images and sounds, while dirty and worn objects can produce blurred and distorted images and sounds.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the weight limit of the object increases by 5 pounds for each slot level above 2nd.

You deliver a powerful shoulder strike to your target. Make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature becomes stunned for 1 minute. On a critical hit, the primary target is violently pushed back 15 feet and can hit a creature of your choice as a secondary target, provided it's in the same direction and range as the primary target was pushed. In this case, the secondary target is also stunned. Oozes are immune to this spell.
	Each stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns. If they succeed, the stunned condition ends.

A creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, becoming paralyzed on a failure. On a successful save, the creature's nervous system is fatigued and on its next turn, it cannot use one of its actions, be it an action, bonus action, or movement. A paralyzed creature can make another saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the condition on a success but still being affected by the action restriction on its next turn. If your concentration is broken, paralyzed creatures are released but still suffer from the action restriction.

The crossing lasts only 1 minute and is completely safe, with air currents protecting creatures during the journey.
	The path can be used by both sides, but the path is only open in one direction at a time while the crossing is taking place.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 45-foot cone and deals 10d6 thunder damage.

You touch a non-magical object weighing up to 10 pounds, causing it to briefly glow with an earthy light before splitting into a number of identical copies equal to twice your proficiency bonus (minimum of 4). Each copy has the same appearance, weight, and physical properties as the original object, including any markings or inscriptions.
	However, the copies created by this spell bear an unnatural aura that makes them immediately identifiable as magical constructs to anyone who inspects them closely. As a result, it is very difficult to use these copies to deceive others or pass them off as genuine items.
	The copies created by this spell last for 1 hour or until they are destroyed, at which point they crumble into a pile of dust. You can end the spell prematurely by using a bonus action to cause one or more copies to disappear.
	The copies created by this spell are mundane objects and do not possess any magical properties. Additionally, they cannot be used to create copies of items made of precious metals or gems, as their unique physical properties cannot be replicated by this spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the weight limit of the object increases by 10 pounds for each slot level above 2nd.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide and deals 2d6 acid damage plus 1d6 acid damage for each slot level above 2nd.

You immolate a hostile undead or extraplanar creature (devil, demon, penumbral, etc.) that you can see within the range of the spell. The target creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, nothing happens, but on a failure, it is consumed by flames and it is destroyed, leaving only ashes behind. If the target is an undead whose soul is trapped elsewhere (such as a lich and its phylactery or an undead created from a body whose soul was trapped), it must make a second Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is immolated and destroyed. If the target is extraplanar, it returns to its home plane and must make another Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is immolated and destroyed.

You transform a 30-foot-radius circular area, centered on a point within range, into quicksand. The area becomes difficult terrain and every creature within it at the time of casting, or that starts its turn or enters the area, must make a Strength saving throw. On the first failure, the creature begins to sink in the sand and becomes restrained. On the second failure, the restrained creature sinks even further, becoming incapacitated. On a third failure, the incapacitated creature sinks completely into the sand and becomes stunned. Each time a creature succeeds on a Strength saving throw, it regresses one step in the number of failures, becoming unburied if it reaches 0 failures.
	A creature that is completely buried by this spell cannot breathe, is under total cover, has disadvantage on Strength saving throws, and suffers 3d10 bludgeoning damage for each failure it has on Strength saving throws. Failures beyond the third are added to the number of failures.
	Another creature that is adjacent to a buried creature and is not under any effect of the spell can use an action to help dig out the buried creature. The creature must make a Strength ability check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees the creature from the spell's effects, but on a failure, it is pulled into the area of effect and counts as having failed a Strength saving throw against the spell. A creature within the area of effect that tries to help another does so with disadvantage on the Strength check.
	When the spell ends, all creatures that are restrained suffer 3d10 bludgeoning damage, all creatures that are incapacitated suffer 6d10 bludgeoning damage, and all creatures that are stunned suffer 10d10 bludgeoning damage. Objects and creatures that are dead or die from the final damage remain buried, while surviving creatures are expelled from the ground.
	Objects that are not being held are automatically buried, and structures within the area suffer 30 bludgeoning damage when the spell is cast, and at the beginning of each turn that you maintain the spell.

Elemental Flux: With your next elemental surge, you stomp the ground. All creatures in a 30-foot-radius circle centered on you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, taking 14d6 bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone on a failed save. Each creature within the quicksand area that is hit by this elemental surge fails in the saving throw automatically, counting as a failure for the spell too.

The creature is immune to damage, has its movement reduced to 0, and is incapacitated while inside the flower. The creature can leave the flower at any time. While inside the flower, the creature is healed for 2d8 + its Wisdom modifier at the start of each of its turns. The creature also removes 1 level of exhaustion every 2 turns spent inside the flower and gets rid of one curse, disease, or poison for every 4 turns spent inside it. If the creature remains inside the flower for the full duration of the spell, it regains any lost limbs.
	The flower automatically dissipates, ending the spell's effects if the creature exits it, you lose concentration, or the flower's hit points are reduced to 0. The flower has an AC of 15, 80 hit points, is resistant to non-magical damage, and immune to poison damage.

You touch a body or a body part that still exists of a creature that has been dead for no more than 500 years. The part of the creature and any material components turn into a seed that automatically sprouts into a plant, generating a bulb where the body of the creature is recreated and restored. After 8 hours, the bulb opens, and the creature is revived, healed of all wounds, any poisons removed, all diseases cured, and freed from any curses that afflicted it when it died. The spell fully restores the body, replacing missing parts.
	If the body of the creature no longer exists, the casting time doubles, and you must speak the creature's name, take an object that belonged to it, and, as part of this spell, bring its spirit, which will be mixed with the material components when forming the seed. If the spirit is not available, the spell fails, and no components are expended.
	The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 5 feet of the plant.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge, instead of dealing damage, imbues the creature's body with an elemental soul, leaving it immune to diseases and curses for a number of days equal to 10d6 days.

	At the end of the spell, the target creature returns to life with all wounds healed, regaining any lost limbs and free of any conditions, but it receives 4 levels of exhaustion. Additionally, the resurrected creature returns free of any non-magical diseases or curses. Magical diseases and curses will resume their effects if they are not removed beforehand.
	The flow of magic is very heavy and until a long rest is finished, you will receive two levels of exhaustion and have a -4 reduction to all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

If a creature eats a fruit without speaking the word, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours.

At the time of casting and at the beginning of each turn of a creature within the area, it must make a Dexterity saving throw, becoming prone on a failure. Creatures that are concentrating on other spells must also make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, losing concentration on a failure.
	Structures within the area suffer 60 bludgeoning damage when you cast the spell, and at the beginning of each of your turns that you maintain concentration. If they reach 0 hit points, they collapse and may cause damage to creatures beneath them, at the GM's discretion.
	In addition, at the GM's choice, other effects may occur, such as fissures or shifting ground. When a fissure is formed, it can have a depth of 3d4x10 feet and a width of 1d4x5 feet. Creatures in the area of the fissure must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they fall into the fissure, or choose one of the edges to remain on the surface on a success. When the ground shifts, at the GM's discretion, a block may rise or sink 1d4x10 feet, taking everything on it along and causing structures it cuts through to collapse.

You attempt to ignite the skin of a creature you can see within range of the spell. The target creature must have some type of skin or leather covering its body and, if so, must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its skin or leather transforms into incandescent material like live coals. On a success, nothing happens.
	A creature with fiery skin gains resistance to fire damage and vulnerability to all other types of damage. It can move in extremely high temperature environments but suffers one point of exhaustion each turn it is in extremely cold temperatures (below 32 °F). Touching or coming into contact with this creature causes 1d6 fire damage and automatically ignites any flammable materials.
	The creature with ember skin can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns, and if it succeeds three times, it is free from the effects. If you maintain concentration for 1 minute while the creature is under the effects of the spell, its skin will permanently be transformed into embers, making this effect permanent. This effect can be removed only by a wish or similar powerful spell.

For the duration of the spell, you are able to see the spiritual aura of all creatures within sight, even when they are invisible. Each type of creature has a specific type of aura that you can see, but you cannot differentiate between them (e.g., an orc and a human have the same aura because they are both humanoids). Additionally, as a bonus action, you can focus on seeing the Ethereal Plane, gaining vision of it until the end of your next turn.

You expel all the air from a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point within range, and the area remains airless for the duration. All creatures within the area at the time of casting who require air to breathe must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they suffer one level of exhaustion, as the air is sucked out of their lungs.
	Furthermore, creatures inside the sphere are subject to the normal rules for suffocation. They can hold their breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + their Constitution modifier
(minimum of 30 seconds), and then survive a number of rounds equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round) before they drop to 0 hit points and begin dying.
	In addition, the airless area becomes difficult terrain for the duration of the spell, and any creature that starts its turn within the area or moves into it on its turn must make a Constitution saving throw, suffering one level of exhaustion on a failed save. Creatures within the area are considered deafened, and no sound can propagate within it.
	Additionally, creatures inside the sphere are immune to thunder damage, and no thunder damage can be caused inside the sphere.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a 30-foot cone and deals 8d6 thunder damage plus 1d6 thunder damage for each slot level above 5th.

You and up to five other willing creatures within range take a step on the border of the Ethereal Plane, entering the region that overlaps with the current plane. While on the border, you can move in any direction as if you had a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can still see and hear the original plane, but everything appears grayed out and muffled, and you can't see anything beyond 60 feet.
	For the duration, as a bonus action, a creature under the effect can choose to move from the Ethereal Plane to the original plane and vice versa. The creature returns to the same mirrored location it was occupying on the plane it left (if it exits the Ethereal Plane in midair and without a flying speed, the creature will fall).
	While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures not on the Ethereal Plane cannot perceive you or interact with you, unless a special ability, magic item, or spell has given them the ability to do so.
	You can move through objects that are not on the Ethereal Plane, ignoring any objects and effects from the plane you originated from.
	When the spell ends, you and your allies return to the plane of origin in the same location you occupied at the time. If you occupy the same space as a solid object or creature when this happens, you will immediately be moved to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you were moved.
	This spell has no effect if you cast it while on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that does not border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.

A spirit disappears when it reaches 0 hit points or when the spell ends. They are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for each of them, which act on their own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you issue no commands, they defend themselves against hostile creatures, but they take no other actions. The GM can provide the statistics of the beasts.

You touch a creature, causing a collection of stones to gather and form an arm of stone that connects with the target's torso. The stone hand can hold and manipulate objects just like a regular hand, but it is not capable of attacking or performing somatic components for spells.
	The target gains the following benefits while the spell is in effect:

	• The target can wield a two-handed weapon or a versatile weapon with two hands, while still using the third hand to hold a shield or perform any other action that would normally require a free hand.

	• The target can use the third hand to hold a card or other small object in a way that is hidden from view, granting advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to cheat at games of chance.

	• The target can use the third hand to manipulate objects that would normally require the use of both hands, such as picking a lock or disarming a trap. If using three hands, the target gains advantage on any Dexterity checks made to interact with objects in this way.

	• The target can use the third hand to retrieve or stow an object that is normally out of reach, such as a potion on a high shelf or a weapon on the ground. The hand can reach up to 10 feet away from the target and can manipulate objects weighing up to 5 pounds. It must still use the appropriate action to do so.

	• The target can use the third hand to perform simple tasks, such as carrying a torch, holding a door open, or carrying a small object while using both of its regular hands for something else.

A sphere of stone envelops a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range of the spell. A non-voluntary creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, becoming trapped within the sphere on a failure.
	The stone sphere is magically reinforced, preventing any magical movement from inside to outside or vice versa. No sound passes through the stone, and those inside cannot see anything outside the sphere, including by magical means. They are under total cover and cannot be harmed by attacks and effects originating from outside.

	• Change Mood: You can influence the person's mood, causing them to feel overall happy, angry, sad, or agitated, affecting their behavior accordingly. This will not force a creature to attack or stop a combat, but will influence its overall mood.

	• Attraction: The target feels a strong attraction to a creature or object of your choice, seeking to approach and interact with it in a non-threatening manner. This effect does not end combat, but may make the target less likely to harm or kill the object of their attraction, not putting itself in danger while doing so.

	• Anger: The target feels anger toward a creature or object of your choice, seeking to harm it or break it. In combat, if an enemy is chosen, the target may make this enemy a preferred target. The creature will not attack or do anything that would be against its principles or would endanger itself The target must make a Wisdom saving throw to resist the spell's effect. If the target fails the saving throw, they are affected by the chosen effect for the spell's duration.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell's duration increases to 2 hours (3rd level), 4 hours (4th level), 8 hours (6th level), 24 hours (8th level), or 7 days (9th level).

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge deals 2d6 fire damage plus 1d6 fire damage for each slot level above 2nd.

You summon a dragon spirit that manifests in the form of a dragon. The spirit's physical form uses the stat block of a young brass dragon, but its only breath attack available is Fire Breath. It has its own turn and place in initiative, and will assist you to the best of its ability for the duration. When you cast this spell, choose between red, brass and gold, and the spirit will take on the appearance of that type of dragon. If the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points or you lose concentration, the spell ends and the dragon disappears.

You conjure a plant servant. You choose an area rich in vegetation that fills a 10-foot cube within range. The vegetation joins together and forms a plant creature of CR 5 or lower in a space up to 10 feet from the point of origin. The plant obeys you to the best of its ability and acts after you in the initiative order. You can give simple action commands, such as attacking a target or running in a direction, as a free action. If you want to give a longer command, you must use a bonus action. If you lose concentration, the plant servant will continue to follow the last command until it completes it. If the plant servant completes its action and cannot hear or receive new commands, it will take the Dodge action and protect itself as best it can.
	You can use an action to regain concentration on this spell a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. The plant disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge infuse your plant servant with energy, allowing it to use an action to cast the elemental surge cantrip as if it were you, only once during the spell's duration, dealing 5d6 poison damage and requires a Constitution saving throw

You cause a creature within your line of sight to immediately fall asleep and have wonderful dreams. The creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to resist. If failed, it falls asleep. If the creature sleeps until the end of the spell's duration, the sleeping creature recovers as if it had taken a long rest. A creature affected by the effects of this spell can only be targeted again after completing a normal long rest. If cast before this condition is met, the spell has no effect. You can only benefit from another long rest after 24 hours.

You conjure spirits of the earth that take the physical form of terracotta soldiers. You can conjure up to 16 soldiers and each one uses the stat block of an animated armor. You have a telepathic link and all soldiers listen to your orders mentally.
	They all act after you in the initiative order and will follow your orders as best as they can. You can give simple course of action commands, such as attacking a target or running in a direction, as a free action. If you want to give a command the size of a sentence, you must use an action. If you lose concentration, the soldiers will continue to follow the last command until it is completed.

At the end of the spell, all the spirits turn to dust.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge deals acid damage and affects a 45-foot cone. Each terracotta soldier inside the area won't take this damage, absorbing the acid instead. If a terracotta soldier is reduced to 0 hit points, it will explode in acid, forcing all creatures within 5 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 acid damage.

Whenever you detect blood drops, make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine what you have uncovered. You learn the following information based on the results of your check:

	• 10 or more: You determine if any creature spilled blood and how many there are and their types.

	• 13 or more: You determine the severity of injuries, knowing if each creature is dead or alive.

In addition, for the duration of the spell, you gain advantage on your first attack each turn you make against a creature whose blood you analyzed for weaknesses, even if that creature has none.

You unleash a burst of bubbles in a 30-foot wide, 80-foot long line, affecting all creatures within. Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or be engulfed in a bubble. Once trapped, a creature is considered underwater, incapacitated, and vulnerable to lightning damage. Its speed is reduced to 0, except for swimming speed. At the start of each of its turns, the trapped creature can make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice). On a successful save, it is no longer incapacitated but remains trapped inside the bubble. A creature can escape the bubble by destroying it. Each bubble has an AC of 17 and 30 hit points, is immune to acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, lightning, poison, and psychic damage, and has resistance to non-magical slashing and piercing damage.
	Creatures outside the bubble can attack it, but if the attacker is Huge or smaller and uses a melee attack, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the attacking creature becomes trapped in another bubble that emerges from the first.
	If you lose concentration, the spell ends and all bubbles are destroyed. Creatures with a swimming speed automatically escape the bubble.

24 hours You concentrate all your control over the force of the element, causing the power of the wind to lift entire locations and relocate them to another place. The spell affects a circular area of land within range with a half mile radius and 100 feet in depth, lifting the block of land, including everything it carries above it.
	Once in motion, the block moves 30 feet per turn, uninterruptedly in the last commanded direction. With a bonus action, you can make the block start moving, change the direction of movement, or stop it.
	The block of land can only move through spaces it can fit into. If the block has its movement interrupted by an object or volume of land equal to or larger than it for more than 1 minute, the spell ends. Once the spell ends, the block descends slowly until it lands on the ground.
	Once during the spell's duration, you can grant control (concentration) to another creature that has spellcasting. You can create a block of land that levitates permanently by casting the spell on the same block for a year and, on the last day, defining a creature that will receive control over its movement without needing to concentrate or have spellcasting abilities. If the creature dies or is willing, you can change the control to another creature with a new casting of this spell.

You create a volcano from a point on the ground within range. From the moment you cast the spell, a volcano begins to rise from the ground, growing in four distinct stages. Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, it produces additional effects of the next stage.

First stage: When you cast the spell, a 20-foot-radius sphere around the point you choose becomes extremely hot, and the ground becomes scorching hot. Creatures that enter or start their turn within the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d8 fire damage on a failure or half as much on a success.

Second stage: The ground within the area of the first stage rises, transforming the area into difficult terrain and beginning to release toxic gasses. All creatures within the area and a further 20-foot radius must make a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned due to the toxic gasses. Additionally, the effects of the first stage increase to a 40-foot radius.

Third stage: The raised area explodes in lava, and all creatures in the 20-foot-radius sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 8d8 bludgeoning damage and 3d8 fire damage, are thrown 20 feet in the opposite direction, and become coated in lava. A creature coated in lava takes 8d8 fire damage at the start of each of its turns for the next minute, or until it is doused with 3 gallons of water or uses an action to clean itself. In addition, the area affected by the second stage increases to a further 20-foot radius, and the area affected by the first stage increases to a total of a 60-foot radius.

Fourth stage: A 20-foot-radius pool of lava forms at the center of the volcano, rising to a height of 40 feet and beginning to launch magma spheres into the surrounding area. The magma spheres strike three locations of your choice within 100 feet of the center and affect a 10-foot-radius circle. Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 10d8 fire damage and become coated in lava on a failed save, or half as much damage and no coating on a successful save. Buildings within the affected area are destroyed, with the extent of the damage determined by the GM.

If you lose concentration on the spell, the volcano retreats, returning one stage per round, and ending after it retreats from the first stage.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge affects a sphere of a 30-foot radius centered on you. All creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 14d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You use water to neutralize spells. With an action, you can target a creature, an object, or a magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. Each spell of 4th level or higher requires you to make a Wisdom ability check (DC 10 + spell level), ending the spell on a success.
	When you cast this spell as a reaction, you can interrupt the casting of a spell, but you must still make the Wisdom ability check regardless of the spell's level, with disadvantage.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, you automatically end spells of up to the same level as the slot used. When cast as a reaction, you gain a +2 bonus to the Wisdom ability check for each slot level above 3rd.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge deals 5d6 cold damage plus 1d6 cold damage for each slot level above 3rd.

You sprinkle ruby dust over the flames, causing a barrier of pure magma to rise from the ground. You can choose the shape of the barrier to be either a straight line with a length of 60 feet, a height of 15 feet, and a width of 5 feet, or a circle with a diameter of 20 feet, a height of 15 feet, and a width of 5 feet. The barrier blocks the line of sight.
	When the barrier appears, every creature within its area is pushed to one side of it, as chosen by you, and must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 fire damage and being covered in lava on a failure, or taking half damage and not being covered in lava on a success.
	A creature that is covered in lava takes 2d8 fire damage at the end of each of its turns until it is either doused in at least 3 gallons of water or takes an action to clean itself.
	A creature can move through the barrier, but it is a painful and slow process. For every 1 foot moved, the creature must spend an additional 4 feet of movement. A creature that chooses to cross becomes covered in lava and must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d8 fire damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success.

Elemental Flux: Your next elemental surge deals 10d6 fire damage.

You create a translucent barrier at a point within range, for the duration. The barrier floats in the air and does not require support, appearing in any position you choose, either horizontal, vertical, or angled. It has a thickness of 1 inch and you can make it semi-spherical or spherical with a radius of up to 15 feet, or flat, creating up to ten panels of 10-foot by 10-foot, which must be contiguous. If the barrier appears in a creature's space that cannot pass through it (see below),
the creature is pushed to one side of your choice.
	When creating the barrier, you can set one creature type or alignment (good, evil, chaotic, lawful) that cannot pass through the barrier. All other creatures or alignments can pass through it normally, but the chosen type cannot pass through the barrier in any way. Attacks and spells of the chosen creature type are neutralized by the barrier, which is indestructible for them, even affecting the Ethereal Plane.
	A creature that is not of the chosen type can choose not to pass through the barrier, so it can walk on the barrier as if it were solid ground, but once it does, it cannot go back on that decision.

You alter your body's composition and form to take on the appearance of a water elemental, gaining the following characteristics:

	• You can move through spaces occupied by enemies and spaces of at least 1 inch wide without squeezing;

	• You become immune to poison and cold damage, resistant to fire, acid, bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage, and immune to the grappled, poisoned, paralyzed, petrified, restrained, and prone conditions;

	• You gain a swimming speed of 60 feet and the ability to breathe underwater;

	• You have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma ability checks and saving throws;

	• Whenever you take an Attack action, you can replace any number of your attacks with slam attacks, which are melee spell attacks with a reach of 10 feet that deal bludgeoning damage equal to 2d8 + your Wisdom modifier, and are considered magical for the purpose of damage resistance;

	• As an action, you can attempt to engulf a creature of your size or smaller within 10 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes restrained and takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. Additionally, any bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage dealt to you before resistance is applied is split evenly between you and the engulfed creature.The engulfed creature can attempt to escape by taking an action and making a Strength saving throw. If it succeeds, it is freed and positioned in a space adjacent to you. You can only engulf one creature at a time, and when you move, any engulfed creature moves with you.

	• You can alter the color and scent of up to 1 cubic foot of water, making it seem clean or dirty.

	• You can instantly chill, heat, evaporate, or freeze any liquid with a volume of up to 1 cubic foot, as long as no creatures are inside it.

	• You can create an instant and harmless sensory effect, such as the sound of rushing water, crashing waves, falling rain, a light mist, or even dampening or drying a surface. The effect must fit within a cube with a side length of 1 foot.

	• You can drain moisture from a small object or plants, such as a flower or fruit, extracting clear, potable water.

You can dismiss these effects with an action.

	The tentacles can be used to attack, requiring a melee spell attack to hit and dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can grapple a creature hit, which will also be restrained until the grapple ends (the difficulty to escape equals your spell save DC). While holding a creature, you cannot use the tentacles to obtain the other benefits of this spell.

You breathe the winds of time over a creature or object, altering the temporal flow by accelerating its natural processes.
	When you cast the spell, you can choose to accelerate the aging process of the targeted creature or object by a factor of twenty, causing it to experience twenty times the normal effects of the passage of time. For example, you could cause a plant to grow to maturity in a matter of hours, accelerate the onset of a poison to take effect within seconds instead of minutes, or end a magical effect with a minimum duration of one minute instantly. This spell can age a touched creature or object by 20 days in one. If the target is a creature, it can make a Constitution saving throw to avoid this spell's effect on a success.
	Note that the spell only affects natural and mystical processes related to time, and does not affect the actions or abilities of the target. The spell can be used to affect a wide range of effects related to time, but the GM should determine the limits of the spell's effects and the potential consequences of using it in creative ways.

    <text>Before rolling for an attack, you can, as a free action, infuse your weapons with dark energy.

Before the attack roll, you can choose to gain extra Insanity Points to bolster this damage, as long as the total points gained per use of this mutation do not exceed your madwalker level. For each extra Insanity Point you gain, add 1 to the necrotic damage roll. The total Insanity Points gained cannot exceed your current Insanity Point limit, except when using this mutation without gaining extra points.
	For instance, a 3rd-level madwalker using this power can gain 1 Insanity Point to deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage, 2 points to deal 1d6+1, or 3 points to deal 1d6+2. However, she couldn't gain 4 points, as it would exceed her level. If the current Insanity Point total is 10 and the limit is 12, she can only gain 1 or 2 points on this power. Once she reaches 12 points, she can still use this power (+1d6) but can no longer increase its damage.

If your bite damage reduces a Medium or smaller creature to 0 hit points, you can consume it with a bonus action, earning temporary hit points equal to half the bite damage. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.

Each targeted creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or suffer 6d8 psychic damage and perceive you and your allies as incarnations of their deepest fears due to memories you implant. They remain frightened of you and your allies for the duration.
	Alternatively, you can forgo the damage to implant different types of memories in those who fail their saving throw. Consult with your GM for potential uses. Affected creatures can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.

    <text>With a bonus action, you attempt to attach yourself onto a nearby creature, forcing it to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, you transform and graft yourself onto them, draining their vitality. The afflicted creature suffers 10d10 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns, and you recover hit points equal to half the inflicted damage. The target's speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it can use an action to try to pry you off, making a Strength saving throw. On a success, you are dislodged and fall prone in an adjacent space. While leeching, you are unable to take actions, bonus actions, or reactions, and you are immobile, sticking to your host. Should the creature's hit points reach zero, your parasitic grip ceases, and you appear in an unoccupied adjacent space. At the start of your turn, while leeching, you can gain an extra Insanity Point to voluntarily detach and stand in a nearby unoccupied space.

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and does not suffer the additional effect.

	If a creature within 60 feet deals damage to you, you can use your reaction to shatter the armor into several shards that turn into 4 darts and launch towards the creature that damaged you. Each of the darts deals 1d4+1 force damage to it. Doing so ends the spell.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot above 2nd when you use the reaction.

    <text>When you cast this spell, a glowing rune appears on the ground in a 5-foot square you can see within range. The first time a creature touches the rune after the spell is cast, the rune disappears and a willing creature is transformed for the duration. An unwilling creature may make a Wisdom saving throw; on a success, the spell ends and the creature is not transformed. You choose which transformation occurs when the rune is touched: Reptilian, Avian or Botanic.

Reptilian: The target becomes covered in scales, grows a long tail, and its mouth turns into a crocodilian maw.

	• The maw is a natural weapon. The target can attack with it using your spell attack modifier, dealing piercing damage equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier on a hit.

	• The scaly hide provides improved protection. While the target is not wearing armor its AC is 13 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

	• The tail has a reach of 10 feet. If a creature enters this reach, the target can take a reaction to attempt to trip the creature. Then, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, or it falls prone.

Avian: The target becomes covered in feathers, grows wings, gains bird-like reflexes and hawk-like eyes.

	• The target gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed.
	• The target gains advantage on any perception checks based on sight.
	• When hit by an attack, the target may take a reaction to move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

Botanic: The target becomes covered in bark, and grows leaves and roots.

	• The target's speed becomes 0.
	• The target gains resistance to non-magical bludgeoning damage.
	• The target gains vulnerability to fire damage.

The targeted creature is required to be seated on an obsidian throne worth at least 5,000 gp atop a marble circle, both inscribed with arcane symbols. The creature must also be adorned with a tameranium bracelet on its right wrist and a bauronite bracelet on its left wrist.
	The spell carries significant side effects; however, these are mitigated by increasing amounts of tameranium and bauronite used. With a minimum of 50 gp worth of each material, you gain 2 levels of exhaustion and are unable to cast this spell for 48 hours. Utilizing at least 500 gp of each reduces the exhaustion to one level, but the spell remains unusable for 24 hours. If you use at least 1000 gp of each, you suffer no exhaustion but are unable to recast the spell for 12 hours. The spell fails if casted before the time above pass.
	The subject of the spell must remain seated for the entire casting time. Upon completion, you may choose to implement one of the directives Mindless Soldier, Berserker Beast, or Focused Servant on the target. The Mind Return option can be used on a target already affected by this spell to reverse its effects, which is the only way to do it besides the casting of a wish spell.

Mindless Soldier: The creature becomes dedicated to executing orders and will only comply with commands given by individuals bound to it during the casting. You can designate any number of entities that are part of the same organization known to the creature before the ritual.

Berserker Beast: The target operates on pure instinct and obeys only the caster's basic commands. The target loses speech capability and becomes exceptionally hostile. Also, it has advantage on Strength ability checks and saving throws, and it gains a +2 bonus on Strength-based damage rolls, while it has disadvantage on Intelligence ability checks and saving throws.

Focused Servant: The target concentrates all its proficiency on one particular field of knowledge. Choose one skill or tool. The creature gains proficiency in it, doubles its proficiency bonus for checks related to it, and gains advantage on these checks. However, it cannot apply its proficiency bonus to any other skill checks that aren't directly related to the chosen skill or tool.

Mind Return: For this effect, it is also necessary to provide an object that once belonged to the target, which the spell consumes. If done, you revert the target to its state before the spell was cast on it.

Once you use the roll the spell ends and can't be used again before the next dawn.

    <text>The caster opens a fissure of up to 60 square feet between the Material Plane and the Penumbral Plane to the fissure, allowing creatures to cross from one plane to the correspondent place in the other. Alternatively, you can close an existing fissure between these planes, as long as it does not exceed 60 square feet. A fissure created by this spell automatically closes if a penumbral creature comes within 5 feet of it, but reopens when there are no penumbral creatures within that range.

    <text>You call forth a spear of solid lightning to skewer an enemy. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be marked as the target of three spears that rain down from a cloud created up to 20 feet above the creature's head. Whenever the creature is hit by an attack for the first time on a turn, one of the spears strikes down, dealing 4d4 piercing damage and 4d4 lightning damage. The spell ends when all three spears are used.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the spell creates one aditional spear for each two slot levels above 3rd.

On your next turn, you can use your action to transform the cloud into bones made of necrotic energy, which then fall, affecting a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point within range. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a creature to 20 hit points or fewer, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or die, rising as a zombie under your control, as if you had cast the animate dead spell. If the creature is reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage.

On a failure, the creature must roll 1d6 to determine which effect on the table happens to it.

Wildpath Effects:
d6 | Effect
1-2 | The twigs and vines ensnare the creature, which becomes restrained for the duration. The creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.
3-4 | The branches and vines begin to whip the creature, dealing 2d6 slashing damage per turn as long as it remains in the area.
5-6 | Branches, roots, and leaves sway around the creature, blocking its movement and vision. Terrain occupied by the wall of bushes is considered difficult terrain. While within the area, the creature has disadvantage on attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

As a bonus action, you can mark one creature you can see within 30 feet of you to become the nexus of a life-draining swarm for the duration of the curse. The first time the marked creature deals damage with an attack, the attack inflicts additional Necrotic damage equal to your Hemocraft die roll. Simultaneously, you regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.

Amplify: When you choose to amplify this blood curse, the creature gains vulnerability to necrotic damage for the duration of the curse. Additionally, the radius of the draining swarm's influence expands to 10 feet around the cursed target. The amplified curse concludes when any creature takes necrotic damage from the Draining Cloud.

As a bonus action, you can target one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. A giant spectral mosquito attaches itself to the target, causing it to have disadvantage on attack rolls against anyone except you. Furthermore, any damage the cursed creature takes heals the attacker by an amount equal to half of the damage dealt.
	The curse lasts until the end of your next turn.

Amplify: When you amplify this blood curse, the spectral mosquito drains the very essence of the target. After the curse ends, the target suffers one level of exhaustion as a result of the draining torment.

When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw or death saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the creature's roll, potentially turning a failure into a success. You must finish a short rest before you can use this theory on the same creature again.

You banish a creature that you can see within range into the Space Between Worlds. Upon this roiling plane of chaotic potential, the target wanders incomprehensible vistas searching for a way back via strange and absurd exits. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes.
	The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes an Intelligence check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends. On a failed check, the target takes 4d6 psychic damage.
	When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.
	Time passes differently for the target within the Space Between Worlds, and it perceives its time spent there as having lasted hundreds or perhaps thousands of years, even if it was only gone for rounds or minutes in the mortal world.
	A creature which dies in the Space Between Worlds does not return.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell. When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

You create two Large hands of shimmering, octarine force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hands last for the spell's duration. Both hands move at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hands.
	Each hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If one or both of the hands drop to 0 hit points, the spell ends. Each hand has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0) and occupies its space.
	When you cast the spell, and as an action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hands up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with each. Both hands can perform the same action, or different ones. The two hands must move to remain within 30 feet of each other.

	• Arcane Slam. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 necrotic damage. If you direct both hands to attack the same target, they gain advantage on the attack roll.

	• Forceful Throw. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it. If both hands are used against the same target, you can throw them ten times your spellcasting ability modifier, and gain advantage on the check against a Large or smaller target.

	• Eldritch Grip. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If both the hands are used against the same target, they can grapple a creature regardless of its size, and you have advantage on the grapple check against a Large or smaller target.

	• Contaminated Crush. You can have a hand crush a target it is grappling. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, the target must make a Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Contamination Level. If both the hands are grappling the same target, you can have them rip the grappled target limb from limb. They deal an extra 4d12 necrotic damage.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the arcane slam and contaminated crush options increases by 2d12 and the damage from the eldritch grip increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.

You weave contaminated energy to temporarily imbue a creature within range with a beneficial mutation. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains that effect until the spell ends.

	• Strength. The target has advantage on Strength attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. The target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, its melee weapon attacks deal an additional 2d6 necrotic damage for the spell's duration.

	• Constitution. The target has advantage on Constitution checks and saving throws. The target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, it gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for the spell's duration.

	• Dexterity. The target has advantage on Dexterity attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. The target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, its attacks with ranged and finesse weapons score a critical hit on an 18–20 for the spell's duration.

	• Intelligence. The target has advantage on Intelligence ability checks and saving throws, as well as spell attack rolls. The target can also choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, for the duration of this spell, while the target is concentrating on a spell it has cast, it's concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.

	• Wisdom. The target has advantage on Wisdom ability checks and saving throws, as well as spell attack rolls. The target can also choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, for the duration of this spell, it gains blindsight to a range of 60 feet and can't be surprised while it is conscious.

	• Charisma. The target has advantage on Charisma ability checks and saving throws, as well as spell attack rolls. In addition, the target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, for the duration of this spell, when the target makes a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, it can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can choose one additional effect for every two slot levels above 2nd.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell. When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

A creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to 4d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
	When you cast this spell, the target can choose to gain a Contamination Level as well. If it does, it instead regains hit points equal to 8d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 2d6 for each slot level above first, or 4d6 if the target chooses to gain a Contamination Level.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell. When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

You call down eldritch falling stars that crash into the earth at four points you can see within range. Each creature within a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 10d6 radiant damage, 10d6 necrotic damage, 10d6 thunder damage, 10d6 psychic damage, and 10d6 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one burst is affected only once.
	The falling stars leave lasting contamination in the areas they affect, which lasts for one hour. A creature that starts its turn within the affected area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 5d6 necrotic damage and gains 1 Contamination Level. It takes half as much damage and does not gain any Contamination Levels on a successful save. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage immediately undergoes a Monstrous Transformation as if they had gained 6 Contamination Levels.
	The spell damages structures and objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell. When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

This spell transforms a willing creature that you touch into a horrific monstrosity. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.
	The new form can be an aberration with a Challenge Rating of 4 or lower.
	The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen aberration. It retains its alignment and personality.
	The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.
	The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
	The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
	In addition to a delerium fragment worth 100gp, you must provide either the heart or brain (or equivalent organ in the case of aberrations with a truly alien physiology) taken from a creature of the same type: the organ must either be recently harvested or magically preserved via gentle repose or similar magic. As part of casting the spell, you drive the delerium fragment into the organ, and both are consumed by the spell. The Game Master determines if an aberration's physiology makes its organs suitable for use with this spell.

On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 3d6 necrotic damage and gains 1 level of exhaustion. If a target succeeds on three of these saves, the spell ends for that creature.

A lesser restoration spell cast on a target ends this spell early for that creature.

After taking this damage, any affected creature with 25 hit points or fewer remaining immediately dies and is reduced to a weathered skeleton as their flesh and soft tissue blows off like ash.

You seize upon the flow of time around up to three creatures of your choice within range, drawing seconds from them to use them yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.
	An affected target can't take reactions. On its turn, it must choose to either move, take an action, or a bonus action: a target can do only one of the three.
	A creature affected by this spell can spend its action to try to pull back the threads of time. If it does, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.

That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Cast a Spell, Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell. When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

You call forth a contaminated elemental to do your bidding. Choose air, earth, fire, or water. Eldritch energy conjures a contaminated elemental of the chosen type, which appears in an unoccupied space within range: either an animated sludge (water), entropic flame (fire), living haze (air), or walking geode (earth). Each uses the summoned delerium elemental stat block below, but gains different traits based on the chosen element used to conjure the elemental. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
	The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration of the spell. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys any verbal command you give it (no action required by you). If you don't give any commands, it attacks the closest hostile creature it can see, moving towards it by the most direct route.
	The elemental doesn't disappear if you lose concentration on this spell. Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it attacks you. An uncontrolled elemental can't be dismissed by you, and it remains until it is destroyed.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

You call forth The Thing with the Writhing Tail. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the stat block of "The Thing with the Writhing Tail" in the Bestiary. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
	The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger. 

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

    <text>This is a Contaminated Spell. When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.

This spell allows you to control gravity in a 100-foot-cube centered on a point within range. When you cast this spell and at the start of each of your turns for the spell's duration, you decide which direction gravity pulls within the area. All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall in the direction you choose until they reach the edge of the area. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.
	If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the edge of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.
	Alternatively, you can decide to prevent gravity from acting within the area. When you do, creatures within the area levitate in midair, and must move by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows them to move as if they were climbing. Unattended objects float around randomly.
	At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.

A ranged weapon's long range is either three times its normal range or four times its normal range, depending on the type of projectile it fires. When a masterwork property changes a weapon's normal range, change the long range by three or four times the amount, as appropriate to the weapon.
	You can't apply a weapon property if it would reduce a ranged weapon's normal range to 0 feet, and you can't remove the Ammunition or Thrown properties from a ranged weapon.

    <text>Components: Masterwork martial or exotic weapon with the Two-Handed property that doesn't have the Double property.
You can apply any number of Apprentice properties to a masterwork weapon.

This weapon gains the Heavy property. If it is a melee weapon, its damage die increases by one step.
	If it is ranged, its normal range increases by 20 feet and its long range increases accordingly.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Damage Steps:
If a masterwork property increases or decreases a weapon's damage, it is moved up or down one step on the following scale, down to a minimum of 1d4:

	1d4 → 1d6 → 1d8 → 1d10 → 1d12 or 2d6

Further increases add a +1 bonus to the weapon's damage roll.
	If the weapon being modified has 2 damage dice (such as a greatsword or a firearm), the scale is instead:

	2d4 → 2d4 + 1 → 2d6 → 2d6+1 → 2d8 → 2d8+1 → 2d10 → 2d10 + 1 → 2d12

    <text>Components: Masterwork ranged weapon with the Loading or Reload property that doesn't have the Tension property.
You can apply any number of Apprentice properties to a masterwork weapon.

This weapon loses the Ammunition, Loading, and Reload properties, as well as any damage die increases associated with those properties. (It regains these properties if you later remove Blaster.) It gains the Blaster property and deals radiant damage instead of its normal damage type. If this weapon wasn't previously a firearm, its damage die increases by four steps and moves to two damage dice, if possible. The weapon's normal range increases by 20 feet and its long range increases accordingly.

Blaster: A weapon with the Blaster property is a ranged weapon that requires no ammunition. Blasters are considered firearms for the purpose of class features and abilities. Like firearms, you don't add your ability score modifier to blasters' damage rolls.

Damage Steps:
If a masterwork property increases or decreases a weapon's damage, it is moved up or down one step on the following scale, down to a minimum of 1d4:

	1d4 → 1d6 → 1d8 → 1d10 → 1d12 or 2d6

Changing Weapon Ranges:
A ranged weapon's long range is either three times its normal range or four times its normal range, depending on the type of projectile it fires. When a masterwork property changes a weapon's normal range, change the long range by three or four times the amount, as appropriate to the weapon.
	You can't apply a weapon property if it would reduce a ranged weapon's normal range to 0 feet, and you can't remove the Ammunition or Thrown properties from a ranged weapon.

Blaster Notes:
In high-tech settings, such as the Dark Matter campaign setting, many weapons release blasts of energy instead of conventional projectiles. The Blaster property replaces the Firearm property in such settings. All rules that apply to firearms apply to blasters as well.
	For the purpose of applying masterwork properties, blasters count as ranged weapons with the Ammunition and Reload properties. You can also apply the Overheat and Variable properties listed below to blasters.

One or more of your organs or limbs have been replaced with a part harvested from a monster. A replacement can effectively solve any amputation or organ failure, but they can't return to life someone that has died; such work is solely the domain of necromancy. Replacement limbs can resemble the original limb or can demonstrate obvious monstrous characteristics, depending on the donor. A replacement organ or limb takes up one body slot relevant to it; for example, a troll's hand takes the Arms slot and a replacement kidney takes up the Internal slot.

    <text>Prerequisite: mage hand cantrip

Your skill with the mage hand cantrip allows you to use it as an extension of yourself. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can use one of the following effects with the hand:

Press: The hand pushes against a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. Choose a direction away from that creature. Every foot of movement in that direction while the hand is pressing against it costs the creature 1 extra foot of movement. The hand continues to push against the target until the spell ends or you use your bonus action to use a different effect with the hand.

Punch: The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 force damage.

Seize: The hand grabs a Small or smaller creature and attempts to grapple it. The creature must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (its choice) against your spell save DC or be grappled by the hand. The hand continues to grapple the target until the target uses an action to break the grapple on its turn, the spell ends, or you use your bonus action to use a different effect with the hand.

    <classes>Warmage (Valda) (Tricks)</classes>
    <text>Prerequisite: minor illusion cantrip

When you create the image of an object in an unoccupied space using the minor illusion cantrip, you can fill it with fibers of shadowstuff, causing it to become partially real. No matter what form the semi-real object takes, it still must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. It has AC 10 and 5 hit points, and it weighs 5 pounds. You can only have one semi-real illusion at a time. While this semi-real object exists, the cantrip requires your concentration.
	The illusion can't replicate a creature, but it can deal damage to a creature within its 5-foot cube. If the illusion is of an object that can deal damage, a creature that enters the object's 5-foot cube or begins its turn there must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 damage of a type appropriate to the illusion. This damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6). This damage can't trigger Warmage Edge or any warmage tricks.

This weapon becomes magical, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your warmage spells. Your signature focus is bonded to you, and gains a number of special abilities:

	• As a bonus action, you can call your signature focus to your hand, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as it.

	• You can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, to attack and damage rolls using your signature focus.

	• Your signature focus gains a number of charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of 1). When you deal damage to a creature with it or a cantrip cast through it, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d8 force damage to that creature. Your focus regains all expended charges when you finish a long rest.

Each attack must target a different creature.
	For example, fire bolt deals 3d10 damage. You can choose to target three creatures and deal 1d10 damage to each creature, or you can target two creatures, dealing 1d10 damage to one creature and 2d10 damage to the other creature, or you can target one creature for 3d10 damage.

The weapons and ammunition of each creature within 30 feet of you become locked in their sheaths, quivers, or holsters until the end of your next turn. During this time, a creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing its weapon on a success.

    <text>As an action, a nonmagical object you choose within 30 feet of you sprouts legs and runs away. You can't target an object that weighs more than 10 pounds, nor can you target one that is being worn as clothing or armor; however, you can target certain objects that are being carried, as long as they aren't affixed entirely around a creature's body or being held in a hand. For example, you can't target a creature's helmet or a sword it is wielding, but you can target a drawstring pouch it is wearing or a dagger that is sheathed at its side.
	The object animates, wriggles free of its owner (if it has one), sprouts two legs, and moves 20 feet in a direction you choose. At the start of each of your turns, you can choose which direction the object moves. The object has an AC of 10, if its AC wasn't already higher, and remains animated until the end of your next turn, or until it is picked up.

    <time>8 Hours</time>
    <classes>Witch (Valda): Grand Hexes</classes>
    <text>You can induct others into your insidious coven. By performing a special ritual over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can intermingle your cursed magic with a willing creature that has the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature. This creature enters into your coven. You can have up to two creatures other than yourself in your coven at a time.
	While two or more members of your coven are within 30 feet of one another, they gain the ability to cast additional spells, as shown on the Coven Spellcasting table. Additionally, members of your coven gain access to a shared pool of five spell slots—one of each level, from 1st to 5th level—which they can use to cast spells as normal. Expended spell slots are regained when all members of the coven finish a long rest.
	Coven members use their own spellcasting ability to determine spell attack modifiers and spell save DCs. A coven member can't cast spells of a level for which it doesn't personally have spell slots, even if using a higher level shared spell slot. A shared spell slot can be used, for instance, to cast a lower level spell at higher levels, but it can't be used to cast a spell normally too high-level for a spellcaster.

Coven Spellcasting:
Spell Level Spells
1st | bane, hideous laughter
2nd | invisibility, ray of enfeeblement
3rd | bestow curse, counterspell
4th | banishment, polymorph
5th | contagion, scrying

    <text>As a bonus action, if your familiar is within 5 feet of you, you can meld with it, transforming into a magical hybrid. For the next minute, you gain the following benefits:

	• You gain temporary hit points equal to your familiar's hit points.

	• Your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier, as long as you aren't wielding a shield. You can use this calculation to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC.

	• You gain two natural melee weapons, corresponding to your familiar's attacks. You are proficient with these weapons, and use Charisma for their attack and damage rolls. On a hit, these natural weapons deal 1d10 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice).

	• You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.

	• You can use any action or movement your familiar possesses.

This transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it on your turn (no action required). When it ends, your familiar is dismissed, and you can't summon it again until you finish a short or long rest.

    <text>As an action, you can produce a magical apple out of thin air. This apple can possess whatever appearance you wish, be that a ruby red coloration, a golden skin, or the appearance of crystal. On your turn, you can use your action to eat the apple, granting you the following benefits:

	• You regain hit points equal to twice your witch level + your Charisma modifier

	• You regain an expended spell slot of 5th level or lower.

	• You can end one of the following conditions affecting you: blinded, deafened, paralyzed (if the apple is fed to you as an action), or poisoned.

However, the apple is suffused with your insidious magic. If a creature other than you eats the apple, it doesn't gain any benefits and instead must make a Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed save, the creature becomes poisoned for up to 24 hours. For each hour the creature is poisoned, it loses 4d8 hit points. This loss can't be reduced or avoided. If this reduction causes the creature to drop to 0 hit points, the creature instead drops to 1 hit point and falls into a catatonic sleep, remaining unconscious for up to 7 days. A remove curse spell or similar magic can awaken the creature early.
	The apple shrivels and becomes nonmagical if it isn't eaten within 24 hours. Once you produce a magical apple, you can't produce another one until you finish a long rest.

This target must make a Charisma saving throw. A creature with a challenge rating greater than your witch level automatically succeeds on this save. On a failed save, you disappear along with your equipment and the target becomes incapacitated and possessed; you gain control of its body but don't deprive the target of its awareness. While possessing the creature, you can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect. You maintain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma and your alignment, but otherwise use the creature's statistics. You don't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
	For the purposes of spells and effects which can end possession, such as the spell dispel evil and good, you are treated as an Undead spirit and can be banished from the target, returning to your own body, which rematerializes within 5 feet of the target.
	This possession lasts for 1 hour, or until the body drops to 0 hit points or you are forced out by a spell or other magical effect that ends possession.
	Once you use this grand hex, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

    <text>Lighting a candle, you speak dark curses in a lost tongue, directed at one creature you can see within range. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or be cursed for the duration. While cursed, the creature takes psychic damage once per turn equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier whenever it attacks or casts a spell. If the target doesn't attack or cast a spell on its turn, it can repeat their saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success.
	A remove curse spell ends this curse early.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you deal an additional 1d8 psychic damage for each slot level above 1st.

	Additionally, an arc of lightning jumps to a creature you choose within 5 feet of the target, dealing 1d6 lightning damage.

Cantrip Upgrade: This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an additional 1d8 lightning damage, and the secondary damage deals an additional 1d6 lightning damage to their targets. Both damage rolls increase by one die at 11th level (2d8 and 3d6) and 17th level (3d8 and 4d6).

Blade cantrips aren't intended to function with spells of 1st level or higher which conjure weapons made entirely of magic. The GM decides if blade cantrips can be cast with such weapons.

You conjure a low cobblestone wall along the ground, a perfect source of cover, at a point you can see within range. The wall is 18 inches thick and is composed of three 5-foot long by 3-foot high segments. Each segment must be contiguous with at least one other segment.
	A Medium creature that hunkers behind the wall has half cover from ranged attacks, and a Small creature that hunkers behind it has three-quarters cover from ranged attacks. A prone creature has total cover behind the wall. The wall can be leapt over without using any additional movement.
	Each segment has AC 10 and 60 hit points. Reducing a segment of the wall to 0 hit points causes it to crumble, destroying it. The wall disappears when all the segments are destroyed or the spell ends.

If the target is a creature, it must make a Charisma saving throw (a willing creature may choose to fail this save), or be cursed to be permanently bound to the chosen location. While cursed, the target can act and move around freely, as long as it remains within 20 feet of the point it is bound to. If the target begins its turn outside of this area, it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be dragged 60 feet toward the point it was bound to.
	Additionally, if the creature tries to use extraplanar travel, it must make another Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the travel attempt fails and any resources used are wasted. On a success, the curse is suppressed until the creature returns to the plane on which it was bound, at which point the dragging effect resumes.

You extend your forefinger and thumb, a dangerous gesture mimicking a gun. For the duration, you can use your action to make a ranged spell attack against one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, dealing 1d8 force damage on a hit.
	Your finger gun doesn't require ammunition, but it is considered to be a firearm for spells and effects that apply to firearms.

Cantrip Upgrade: The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

However, the mending is imperfect, and the target's hit point maximum is reduced by the same amount until it finishes a long rest.

Warning for Low-Level Casters:
The spell flawed reconstruction is a risk/reward healing spell, intended for spellcasters that don't usually have access to restorative magic.
	However, at lower levels, the damage it causes can outright kill characters! Be cautious when learning and casting this spell.

On a failed save, a creature is frenzied for the duration. When a creature is frenzied, it draws a melee weapon, if it has one.
	A frenzied creature must use its action at the beginning of its turn to attack a creature within its reach. It uses a melee weapon, if it has one, or an improvised weapon or unarmed strike if it doesn't.
	If multiple targets are within the creatures reach, it chooses its target randomly. If there is no target within the creatures reach, it attacks itself, against its own AC, dealing damage as normal on a hit.
	At the end of its turn, a frenzied creature can repeat its saving throw, ending the effect on itself early on a success.

Each creature within 60 feet other than you which sees the fountain must make a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration.
	While charmed by this spell, a creature must use its movement on each of its turns to get as close to the water as possible. A charmed creature can't willingly move away from the fountain. At the end of its turn, a charmed creature can attempt the saving throw again, ending the effect on a success. Once a creature has succeeded on a save against this spell, it can't be affected by the same instance of it again.
	If a creature is within 5 feet of the fountain, you can use a bonus action to command the water to lash out at that creature. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the water deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage to the target. If the target is charmed by this spell, it can attempt the saving throw again after taking damage from it.

    <text>A rift opens, pouring forth tons of brick and stonework that neatly and quickly assemble into a vast gothic estate. The estate consists of a manor containing a vault, a spacious 200-by-200-foot courtyard, and a 10-foot high wrought iron fence around the perimeter. Any creature within the estates area is escorted away by harmless but forceful specters.
	You can create any floor plan you like for the manor, but the space can't exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side, or five stories in total, including basements. The manor is adorned with barred windows and decorative gargoyles, but is furnished and decorated as you choose. Once the manor is first created, these details are recorded in the miniature manor used to cast the spell and can't be changed. The manor is staffed by 50 skeletons obedient to you, and contains enough food to serve 50 people each day for a week. The skeletons can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature.
	The manor contains a 15-foot cube vault, which is an extradimensional space. Items placed within the vault will be present next time you cast this spell.
	The courtyard is drenched in necromantic magic, such that any Humanoid buried in its grounds rises 24 hours later as a ghoul under your control, as per the create undead spell. When the spell is cast, 3 ghouls are animated in the courtyard. These Undead are under your control, but can't leave the estate. They patrol the estate if given no other instructions. Undead can't be turned within the estate.
	The estate crumbles into dust and bone after 7 days, and all items placed within the manor appear safely in the space the manor occupied. If cast in the same place once every 7 days for a year, the estate becomes permanent.

    <text>A ring of flame ignites above your head and then springs outward, coming to rest in a burning circle. The circle is composed of a 5-foot wide line of flame, curving to form a 10-foot-radius ring around you. Each creature you choose within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 fire damage, or half as much on a successful save.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

    <text>When you cast this spell, you stab a black, ritualistically prepared Humanoid heart. The ichor from the heart infects the land with foul necromantic energies, causing up to one hundred piles of bones or corpses of Medium or Small Humanoids within a 1-mile radius to rise from the dead, becoming skeletons or zombies (the GM has the creatures' game statistics). The Undead dig their way out of graves, smash their way out of mausoleums, and tear down cemetery gates.
	The creature that is holding the heart can use its action to issue a general command to all Undead created by the spell, such as to destroy a town or hunt down a particular creature. Only one general command can be issued to the Undead every 24 hours. If not issued a command, the Undead indiscriminately attack living creatures, other than the creature that is holding the heart and creatures designated by it. Once given an order, the Undead continue to follow it to the best of their ability until the task is complete.
	Even while you hold the heart, the Undead aren't directly under your control, and therefore don't count against any limitations of Undead you can command.
	The Undead remain animated until the spell ends. The spell ends if the heart is destroyed (AC 20, HP 10, immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage) or targeted by a dispel magic spell cast as a 9th-level spell. When the spell ends, all Undead animated by it are instantly destroyed, crumpling into a heap. The spell also ends if every Undead created by it is destroyed.

	The hand is an object that has AC 18 and hit points equal to half your hit point maximum. It has immunity to poison and psychic damage. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. The claw doesn't fill its space. When you cast the spell, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can command the claw to perform one of the following tasks:

Slash: The claw lashes out at a target within 10 feet of itself. Make a melee spell attack using your own spell attack modifier. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 slashing or cold damage (your choice).

Imprison: The claw grabs a Large or smaller creature within 10 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be dragged into the claw's space and restrained for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the restrained target can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand, but on a failure it takes 1d8 cold damage. While a creature is restrained by the hand, the hand can't imprison or slash another creature. The claw can slash a creature it has restrained.

Release: The claw releases an imprisoned target, which is no longer restrained.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of the Slash and Imprison options increases by 1d8 for each spell slot above 3rd.

    <text>You transform a vegetable into a Large magical carriage, complete with reins and two quasi-real horses. The carriage is luxurious and carries up to six passengers-four within and two atop it at the coach's seat. Creatures within the carriage have total cover from external effects, but can see outside through a pair of windows composed of magical force. While sitting in the coach's seat, a creature can control the carriage, which has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace.
	This spell's duration varies depending upon when and where it was cast. If cast in a location where time passes normally, the spell lasts until the twelfth stroke of the next midnight, however long that may be. Elsewhere, the spell lasts for 24 hours.
	When the spell ends, the carriage's occupants are ejected into adjacent unoccupied spaces, the carriage shrinks back into a vegetable, and the quasi-real horses fade.
	The carriage and horses count as a single object with 12 AC and 100 HP. The spell ends early if the carriage and horses are reduced to 0 hit points.

The commoner is friendly to you and your allies, has a basic understanding of all simple unskilled tasks, and can understand the languages you speak, but doesn't speak. The commoner is clothed in common clothes, but has no other equipment.
	In combat, the commoner rolls their own initiative and acts on their own turn. They behave as though they are dutifully employed by you.

When it reverts to its true form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed.

As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.

	For the duration, an invisible eldritch creature stalks the warded portal. Any creature that attempts to pass through the portal must make a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d6 psychic damage, or half as much on a successful save.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

On a hit, a creature takes 6d4 acid damage and, if it is wearing nonmagical metal armor or wielding a nonmagical metal shield, you can corrode either its armor or shield. Corroded armor takes a permanent and cumulative - 3 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed. A corroded shield is destroyed.
	If you target a nonmagical metal object with this spell that isn't being worn or carried, you corrode and destroy parts of the object you choose that can fit within a 1-foot cube.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 3rd. Additionally, you can destroy one additional cubic foot of a nonmagical object for each slot level above 3rd.

Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. If the creature's soul is free and willing, it manifests as a ghostly specter. This spell fails if the spirit was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.
	Until the spell ends, you can ask up to three questions of the specter. The specter knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the specter is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. There is a 5% chance that this spell contacts the wrong spirit, one which will answer questions untruthfully or ambiguously.

    <text>With a quick jolt of necromantic energy, the dead momentarily rise to obey you, if only for a few seconds. Choose the corpse of a Huge or smaller creature that has been dead for no more than an hour. When you cast this spell, the corpse stands up and can move up to 15 feet and make a single melee slam attack against a target of your choice within its reach, using your spell attack modifier. On a hit, this attack deals bludgeoning damage based on the corpses size: a Tiny corpse deals 1d4, a Small corpse deals 1d6, a Medium corpse deals 1d8, a Large corpse deals 1d10, and a Huge corpse deals 1d12. Once the corpse attacks, it once again crumples into a heap. A corpse targeted by this spell doesn't become an Undead creature.

Cantrip Upgrade: This spell's damage increases as you gain levels. At 5th level, the corpse deals two damage dice according to its size. At 11th level, it deals three damage dice, and at 17th level, it deals four damage dice.

    <text>When you cast this spell, three tentacles made of water appear around your body for the duration. As part of the action used to cast the spell, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can command one of these tentacles to grapple a Large or smaller creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be grappled and restrained by the tentacle. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, freeing itself on a success.
	You can grapple as many creatures as you have tentacles. You can use an action or bonus action on your turn to release a grappled creature, or to drag it up to 20 feet in a direction you choose.
	You can also use the tentacles to manipulate objects as an action or a bonus action. Each tentacle can lift up to 100 pounds, and you can command multiple tentacles to work together to lift the same object as part of the same action or bonus action. The tentacles aren't capable of detailed control-for example, they can't open a chest or uncork a bottle. Burning objects are extinguished when a tentacle grabs them.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you gain an additional tentacle for every slot level above 4th.

    <text>Prerequisite: 17th-level Blood Hunter.

As an action, you invoke this most powerful and ancient Rite and touch one living willing creature, granting it an increase in stamina at the cost of its overall health. It instantly gains all the benefits of a short rest, including the ability to expend its Hit Dice to regain hit points. However, the maximum life span of the creature is permanently reduced by 1 year and 1 day, and it suffers 1 level of exhaustion.
	Once you invoke this Blood Rite you must finish a short or long rest before you can invoke it again. You cannot make a Vital Sacrifice to circumvent this once per rest restriction.

    <text>Offering a drop of blood, reduce your maximum hit points by 1 to conjure a Familiar. It is Friendly to you and it obeys your commands. Your familiar uses the following rules:

Statistics. Your Familiar manifests as a CR 0 Beast of your choice, but its creature type is Celestial, Fey, or Fiend. Familiars often reflect the true nature of the caster's soul in appearance and alignment. You can only have one Familiar, but you can perform the ritual again to change its form.

Control. In combat, the Familiar shares your initiative and acts during your turn. It cannot attack, but can otherwise act normally. If it drops to 0 hit points your Familiar is destroyed. If it is destroyed, you regain the maximum hit points spent in its creation at the end of your next long rest.

Dismissal. As an action, you can shunt your Familiar to a unique pocket dimension, or dismiss it forever. As an action, you can recall your Familiar from its pocket dimension, and it reappears in an unoccupied space you can see within 10 ft.

Soul Bound. While your Familiar is within 100 ft., you can communicate with it Telepathically. As an action, you can use your Familiar's senses in place of your own until you end this effect (no action required) or you are Incapacitated. While you do so, you are blind and deaf to your own surroundings.

Spellcasting. When you cast a spell with a range of touch and your Familiar is within 100 ft., your Familiar can use its reaction to deliver that spell using your Spellcasting ability.

    <text>You plant three pieces of ranged weapon ammunition in the ground within range and transmute them to protect the area. The first creature to move within 30 feet of this enchanted ammunition must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 3d6 piercing damage on a failed save, and half as much piercing damage on a successful save.
	As part of casting this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you choose, and the spell ignores them.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, the amount of ammunition that can be transmuted increases by two for each slot level above 2nd. For each additional piece of ammunition you transmute with this spell, the damage increases by 1d6.

    <text>You conjure a spirit in an unoccupied space within range that assumes the form of a supernaturally intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, which is instantly bonded to you. The Steed takes on the form of a Medium or Large quadrupedal beast that you have seen before with a CR of 1/2 or lower that does not have a climbing, flying, or swimming speed. Examples include: elk, camel, giant goat, mastiff, pony, or warhorse.
	Your Steed uses the stat block of the form chosen for it, but its creature type now reflects your alignment: celestial (good), fey (neutral), or fiend (evil). The Steed's Intelligence becomes 6 if it was lower, and it understands one language you speak.
	In combat, the Steed shares your initiative and acts during your turn. You control the Steed and choose how it acts, both in and out of combat. While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.
	While you and your Steed are within 1 mile of one another, you can use a special form of telepathy to communicate.
	If your Steed is reduced to 0 hit points it disappears. You can also use a bonus action to dismiss your Steed, causing it to disappear. Should you cast this spell again you can choose to either conjure the same Steed, and it reappears in range at its maximum hit points, or to conjure a new Steed, releasing your previous Steed from its bond in the process.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, your Steed can take on the form of any Medium or Large quadrupedal or winged beast, celestial, or monstrosity that you have seen before that has a CR of 2 or lower. Examples include: dire wolf, griffon, pegasus, peryton, polar bear, or rhinoceros.

    <text>In place of an attack, you can evoke a whip of pure flame in a free hand, that lasts for the duration. If you let go of the whip, it disappears, but you can evoke this Flame Whip again in place of another attack without expending a spell slot.
	Whenever you could make an attack, you can instead make a melee spell attack with your Flame Whip against one target within 10 feet that you can see. On hit, it takes fire damage equal to 1d10 + your spellcasting modifier, and if the target is Large or smaller you can instantly grapple it with the Whip.
	You cannot attack with the Whip while it is grappling a creature, but a grappled creature takes 1d10 fire damage at the start of its turn and can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, escaping on a success. While in your hand, your Flame Whip sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

The target adds the level of the spell it is casting to its ability check, and you add the level at which you cast this counterspell to your ability check.
	If you know the spell the creature is attempting to cast or if you have it prepared you have advantage on this ability check, unless you are using this spell against another counterspell.
	If the result of your ability check is greater then the result of the target's ability check, its spell fails and has no effect.

No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures in the area are blinded.
	The void creates a warp in the fabric of space, and the area is difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 cold damage.

Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes any Large creatures or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects cannot pass through it. Spells and other magical effects cannot extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the dome is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.

Statistics:
The dome has 100 hit points and Armor Class equal to your Spell save DC. It is immune to poison, psychic, and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, it is vulnerable to force and all magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and it is resistant to all other damage types.

    <text>This spell can only be cast at night. You spill your blood onto the corpse as part of a sinister ritual, reducing your maximum hit points by 1 and creating a Skeleton or Zombie under your control. Undead created by this spell use the rules below:

Control: As a bonus action, you can mentally command the Undead you created with this spell, so long as they are within 60 feet. You determine how they act or set a general course of action (defend the door). Undead follow commands until they are complete. If you order the Undead to attack, it can make a single attack (even if it could make more than one in life), and it uses your Spellcasting ability for attack and damage rolls.
	However, if you do not issue your Undead any commands, they remain in their space and act only defend themselves.

Undead Bond: While an Undead is under your control you can't regain the maximum hit points expended in its creation. However, when you finish a long rest, you can release control over your Undead to regain the maximum hit points spent to create it. When released, your Undead becomes hostile to all living things, the spellcaster that created it in particular.

At Higher Levels: You can cast this spell with a spell slot of a higher level, and expend additional maximum hit points (Max. HP) to create more powerful Undead, as shown here:

Create Undead:
Slot Level Max | HP | Undead
5th | 2 | Ghoul
6th | 4 | Ghast
7th | 6 | Mummy, Wight

	The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has an Armor Class of 5 and 30 hit points. If reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, creating an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius. This rubble lasts until cleared.
	If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.
	If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, any creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is Restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. A Restrained creature can use its action to make either a Strength or Dexterity check against your Spell save DC. On a success, it is no longer Restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.

Form: The new form can be any living Beast you have seen before. Creatures can only be transformed into a Beast with a CR equal to (or lower then) half its level or CR.

Statistics: The creature's game statistics, including mental ability scores are replaced by those of the Beast, but it retains its alignment, personality, and its Hit Points. If the creature is reduced to zero hit points, it reverts to its normal form.

Actions: The creature can only take the actions that would be available to that Beast. It cannot speak, cast spells, or take any actions that require hands or speech.

Equipment: Its clothing, weapons, armor, and objects it is holding meld into the new form. However, it can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

    <text>A shimmering opaque wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range and lasts for the duration.

Orientation &amp; Shape: The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or an angle. It can be free floating or rest on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome, a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. Nothing can pass through the wall physically, and anything viewed through it is lightly obscured. The wall extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall. If it cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creatures must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it chooses which side of the wall it moves to. On a failure, you choose the side it moves to.

Statistics: The wall has 150 hit points and its Armor Class equals your Spell save DC. It is immune to poison, psychic, and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, vulnerable to force and magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and resistant to all other damage types. It cannot be dispelled by a dispel magic spell, but a disintegrate spell destroys the wall it instantly.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th-level or higher, the hit points of the wall created by this spell increase by 25 for each spell slot level above 5th.

    <text>A shimmering, immobile, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area of your choice within range. You choose whether this magic prison is shaped like a cage with bars or a solid box.

Shape: If you choose cage, it can be up to 20 feet on a side and made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart. If you choose box, it can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out of the area. The cage extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

Creatures Inside: When you cast the spell, any creatures that are completely inside the area of the cage are trapped. Any creatures partially within the area, or too large to fit are pushed away until they are completely outside of the cage.
	A creature inside the cage cannot leave it by non-magical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. The spell or effect is wasted on a failed save, but on a success the creature uses the spell or effect to escape.

Statistics: The cage's Armor Class equals your Spell save DC and it has 200 hit points. It is immune to poison, psychic, and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, vulnerable to force and magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and resistant to all other damage types. It cannot be dispelled by a dispel magic spell, but a disintegrate spell destroys the cage it instantly.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th-level or higher, the hit points of the cage created by this spell increase by 25 for each spell slot level above 7th.

On a failed save, they take 2d6 thunder damage and are Deafened while they remain in the area.
	Each subsequent round the storm lasts, you can use your action to add (or end) one of the weather effects below, which lasts for the duration. They affect all creatures and objects in and below the storm, and each can only be added once:

Acid Rain: Acidic rain falls from the clouds, dealing 1d6 acid damage to all creatures at the end of each of your turns.

Freezing Rain: Frigid rain falls from the clouds. The area becomes difficult terrain and heavily obscured. Targets in the area take 1d6 cold damage at the end of each of your turns.

Hail Stones: You infuse the storm with bitter cold. At the end of each of your turns, creatures and objects in the area take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and crops are destroyed.

High Winds: Strong winds up to 50 miles per hour rage, instantly dispersing all fog, mist, or similar effects, mundane or magical. Ranged attacks in the area become impossible.

Lightning Strikes: You charge the storm with lightning. As a bonus action on each turn, you can call six bolts of lighting from the cloud, each striking targets of your choice within the area. They must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 lighting damage on a failure, and half on a success.

	Choose a point within range, and creatures of your choice within a 30-foot radius of the point become frightened for the duration. If a target is immune to the frightened condition, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened anyway.
	At the end of each of a frightened creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it takes 4d10 psychic damage. On a success, the spell ends for that target.

Frightened:
	• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.

You can tap into the primordial stature of your Spirit. When you transform into Archon Form, you can choose for this new Form to grow by one size category, so long as there is room for you to do so. For example, your Archon Form may grow from Medium to Large.
	For each size category the Archon grows above Medium, the reach of its melee attacks grows by 5 feet, its melee attacks deal a bonus 1d4 damage on hit, and its Armor Class Bonus increases by 1.

You can release a minor form of the Spirit sealed within you. You learn the find familiar spell, it counts as a Vessel spell for you, you can cast it as a ritual without providing the material component, and it doesn't count against your Spells Known.
	When you cast find familiar, it resembles a tiny version of your Sealed Spirit, shares the creature type of your Archon, can attack on its turn, and uses the Spirit Familiar stat block.

You can project immense power. When you turn an Iridescent Strike into a ranged spell attack its range becomes (100/300), it ignores half-cover, and treats three-quarters cover as half.
	In addition, when you hit with a ranged Iridescent Strike, you can expend a Vessel Magic spell slot to create a spiritual eruption. Creatures within 30 feet of your target must make a Dexterity saving throw. They take 6d8 damage of the type of your Iridescent Strike on a failure, and half on a success.
	As you gain Vessel levels the damage of this eruption on impact increases: at 13th level (7d8) and 17th level (8d8)

You reveal a fraction of your Spirit's true power, horrifying all who behold you. When you transform into Archon Form, you can force creatures of your choice that can see you within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, creatures are frightened of you for 1 minute.
	A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If the creature is still able to see you it has disadvantage on its saving throw.

The ancient Spirit within you can absorb spells to restore its power. When your Archon sees a creature within 30 feet cast a spell, it can use its reaction to force the spellcaster to make a saving throw with its Spellcasting ability. On a failed save, its spell fails. If the failed spell was a level equal to or higher than your Slot Level, you regain one expended spell slot.
	You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

    <text>You summon a spirit that assumes the form of a nonmilitary land vehicle of your choice, appearing in an unoccupied space within range. The vehicle has the statistics of a normal vehicle of its sort, though it is celestial, fey, or fiendish (your choice in origin). The physical characteristics of the vehicle reflect its origin to some degree. For example, a fiendish SUV might be jet black in color, with tinted windows and a sinister-looking front grille.
	You have a supernatural bond with the conjured vehicle that allows you to drive beyond your normal ability. While driving the conjured vehicle, you are considered proficient with vehicles of its type, and you add double your proficiency bonus to ability checks related to driving the vehicle. While driving the vehicle, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the vehicle.
	If the vehicle drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss the vehicle at any time as an action, causing it to disappear.
	You can't have more than one vehicle bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the vehicle from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can conjure a nonmilitary water vehicle large enough to carry six Medium creatures. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can conjure a nonmilitary air vehicle large enough to carry ten Medium creatures. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can conjure any type of vehicle, subject to the DM's approval.

    <text>This spell plays havoc with electronic devices, making the use of such devices all but impossible. Each electronic device in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range is subject to random behavior while it remains within the area. A device not held by a creature is automatically affected. If an electronic device is held by a creature, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the device affected by the spell.
	At the start of each of your turns, roll a d6 for each affected device to determine its behavior. Except where otherwise indicated, that behavior lasts until the start of your next turn while this spell is in effect.

Device Behavior:
d6 | Effect
1 | The device shuts down and must be restarted. Do not roll again for this device until it is restarted.
2-4 | The device does not function.
5 | The device experiences a power surge, causing an electric shock to the wielder (if any) and one random creature within 5 feet of the device. Each affected creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 6d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
6 | The device is usable as normal.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius of the sphere affected by the spell increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

When you cast the spell, the nearest functioning telephone or similar communications device within 100 feet of the target begins to ring. If there is no suitable device close enough to the target, the spell fails.
	The target must make a successful Charisma saving throw or be compelled to answer your call. Once the connection is established, the call is crystal clear and cannot be dropped until the conversation has ended or the spell's duration ends. You can end the conversation at any time, but a target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw to end the conversation.

    <text>The creature you touch feels reality subtly shifted to its favor while this spell is in effect. The target isn't inconvenienced by mundane delays of any sort. Traffic lights are always green, there's always a waiting elevator, and a taxi is always around the corner. The target can run at full speed through dense crowds, and attacks of opportunity provoked by the target's movement are made with disadvantage.
	Synchronicity grants advantage to Dexterity (Stealth) checks, since the target always finds a handy piece of cover available. Additionally, the target has advantage on all ability checks made to drive a vehicle.
	In the event that two or more creatures under the effect of synchronicity are attempting to avoid being inconvenienced by each other, the creatures engage in a contest of Charisma each time the effects of the spells would oppose each other.

    <text>This spell allows you to bypass system security in order to create a secure login on a foreign system. The login you create allows you administrator-level privileges in any computer system not enhanced through technomagic. The login defeats any technomagic spells of 3rd level or lower.
	Once the duration of the spell expires, the login and all privileges are wiped from the system. System logs still show the activity of the user, but the user identification cannot be found or traced.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you are able to bypass technomagic spells if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.

    <text>You summon a hezrou that appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The hezrou disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
	The hezrou's attitude depends on the value of the food used as a material component for this spell. Roll initiative for the hezrou, which has its own turns. At the start of the hezrou's turn, the DM makes a secret Charisma check on your behalf, with a bonus equal to the food's value divided by 20. The check DC starts at 10 and increases by 2 each round. You can issue orders to the hezrou and have it obey you as long as you succeed on the Charisma check.
	If the check fails, the spell no longer requires concentration and the demon is no longer under your control. The hezrou then focuses on devouring any corpses it can see. If there are no such meals at hand, it attacks the nearest creatures and eats anything it kills. If its hit points are reduced to below half its hit point maximum, it returns to the Abyss.

You can issue orders to the vrock and have it obey you as long as you succeed on the Charisma check.
	If the check fails, the spell no longer requires concentration and the vrock is no longer under your control. The vrock takes no actions on its next turn and uses its telepathy to tell any creature it can see that it will fight in exchange for treasure. The creature that gives the vrock the most expensive gem can command it for the next 1d6 rounds. At the end of that time, it offers the bargain again. If no one offers the vrock treasure before its next turn begins, it attacks the nearest creatures for 1d6 rounds before returning to the Abyss.

Atonement: You touch one willing creature whose alignment has changed, and you make a DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, you restore the target to its original alignment.

Bless Water: You touch one vial of water and cause it to become Holy Water (flask).

Coming of Age: You touch one humanoid old enough to be a young adult. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes an ability check, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check. A creature can benefit from this ceremony just once.

Dedication: You touch one humanoid who would willingly convert to your religion or who wishes to be dedicated to your god's service. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes a saving throw, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the save. A creature can benefit from this ceremony just once.

Funeral Rite: You bless one corpse within 5 feet of you. For the next 24 hours, the target can't become undead by any means short of a wish spell.

Investiture: You touch one willing humanoid. Choose one 1st-level spell you have prepared and expend a spell slot and any material components as if you were casting that spell. The spell has no effect. Instead, the target can cast this spell once without having to expend a spell slot or use material components. If the target doesn't cast the spell within 1 hour, the invested spell is lost.

Marriage: You touch adult humanoids willing to be bonded together in marriage. For the next 24 hours, each target gains a +2 bonus to AC and saving throws while they are within 30 feet of each other. A creature can benefit from this ceremony just once.

Chaos Bolt:
d8 | Damage Type
1 | Acid
2 | Cold
3 | Fire
4 | Force
5 | Lightning
6 | Poison
7 | Psychic
8 | Thunder

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again. A creature can be targeted only once by this mass of chaotic energy.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes extra damage of the type rolled. The extra damage equals 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

    <text>While you cast this spell, you use the cord or rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on a flat surface within your reach. When you finish casting, the cord or rope disappears to become a magical trap.
	The trap is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. The trap triggers when a Small creature or larger moves into the area protected by the spell.
	The triggering creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and be hoisted into the air until it hangs upside down 3 feet above the protected surface, where it is restrained.
	The restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage at the end of each of its turns and ends the restrained effect on a success. Alternatively, another creature that can reach the restrained creature can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect also ends.

Restrained:
	• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
	• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

    <text>You unleash a destructive wave of mental power in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 5d8 force damage, is pushed 20 feet directly away from you, and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn't pushed or knocked prone.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

Prone:
	• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

    <text>You touch the ground and conjure forth a defensive structure made of enormous playing cards. The structure rises with you at its center, harmlessly lifting you and any creatures in the area. The house of cards has a square base that is 30 feet on each side, and it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. The second floor is 20 feet on each side, and the top floor is 10 feet on each side—both centered above the bottom floor. Ramps connect the interior of each floor, and empty doorframes connect the interior and exterior of each level. Creatures inside or on top of the structure have half cover.
	Each card that comprises the house is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall and is very fragile. A card has AC 10 and 1 hit point. The cards are immune to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a card to 0 hit points destroys it. Every time a card is destroyed, roll 1d6. If you roll a 5 or a 6, the house collapses, ending the spell.
	The house and all its cards vanish when the spell ends.

    <text>You call forth a spirit that embodies death itself. Choose a creature you can see within range. The spirit manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of the target, and the target becomes haunted by the spirit. The spirit uses the Reaper Spirit stat block. The spirit disappears when it or the haunted creature is reduced to 0 hit points, or when the spell ends.
	The reaper spirit is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you), but it will only attack the haunted creature. If you don't issue the spirit any commands, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

Cantrip Upgrade: Whether you choose to deal Radiant damage or the weapon's normal damage type, the attack deals extra Radiant damage when you reach levels 5 (1d6), 11 (2d6), and 17 (3d6).
