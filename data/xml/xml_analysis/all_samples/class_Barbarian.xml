      <name>Barbarian</name>
      <text>A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people's elk herd.
	A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.
	Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.
These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.
	For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.

      <name>Primal Instinct</name>
      <text>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature — keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.
	Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>A Life of Danger</name>
      <text>Not every member of the tribes deemed "barbarians" by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.
	Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</text>

      <name>Creating a Barbarian</name>
      <text>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?
	What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to "civilized" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.

Quick Build:
You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the outlander background.</text>

      <name>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</name>
      <text>"I have witnessed the indomitable performance of barbarians on the field of battle, and it makes me wonder what force lies at the heart of their rage."
— Seret, archwizard

The anger felt by a normal person resembles the rage of a barbarian in the same way that a gentle breeze is akin to a furious thunderstorm. The barbarian's driving force comes from a place that transcends mere emotion, making its manifestation all the more terrible. Whether the impetus for the fury comes entirely from within or from forging a link with a spirit animal, a raging barbarian becomes able to perform supernatural feats of strength and endurance. The outburst is temporary, but while it lasts, it takes over body and mind, driving the barbarian on despite peril and injury, until the last enemy falls.

It can be tempting to play a barbarian character that is a straightforward application of the classic archetype—a brute, and usually a dimwitted one at that, who rushes in where others fear to tread. But not all the barbarians in the world are cut from that cloth, so you can certainly put your own spin on things. Either way, consider adding some flourishes to make your barbarian stand out from all others; see the following sections for some ideas.

      <name>Personal Totems</name>
      <text>Barbarians tend to travel light, carrying little in the way of personal effects or other unnecessary gear. The few possessions they do carry often include small items that have special significance. A personal totem is significant because it has a mystical origin or is tied to an important moment in the character's life—perhaps a remembrance from the barbarian's past or a harbinger of what lies ahead.

A personal totem of this sort might be associated with a barbarian's spirit animal, or might actually be the totem object for the animal, but such a connection is not essential. One who has a bear totem spirit, for instance, could still carry an eagle's feather as a personal totem.

Consider creating one or more personal totems for your character—objects that hold a special link to your character's past or future. Think about how a totem might affect your character's actions.

Personal Totems:
d6 | Totem
1 | A tuft of fur from a solitary wolf that you befriended during a hunt
2 | Three eagle feathers given to you by a wise shaman, who told you they would play a role in determining your fate
3 | A necklace made from the claws of a young cave bear that you slew singlehandedly as a child
4 | A small leather pouch holding three stones that represent your ancestors
5 | A few small bones from the first beast you killed, tied together with colored wool
6 | An egg-sized stone in the shape of your spirit animal that appeared one day in your belt pouch</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Tattoos</name>
      <text>The members of many barbarian clans decorate their bodies with tattoos, each of which represents a significant moment in the life of the bearer or the bearer's ancestors, or which symbolizes a feeling or an attitude. As with personal totems, a barbarian's tattoos might or might not be related to an animal spirit.

Each tattoo a barbarian displays contributes to that individual's identity. If your character wears tattoos, what do they look like, and what do they represent?

Tattoos:
d6 | Tattoo
1 | The wings of an eagle are spread wide across your upper back.
2 | Etched on the backs of your hands are the paws of a cave bear.
3 | The symbols of your clan are displayed in viny patterns along your arms.
4 | The antlers of an elk are inked across your back.
5 | Images of your spirit animal are tattooed along your weapon arm and hand.
6 | The eyes of a wolf are marked on your back to help you see and ward off evil spirits.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Superstitions</name>
      <text>Barbarians vary widely in how they understand life. Some follow gods and look for guidance from those deities in the cycles of nature and the animals they encounter. These barbarians believe that spirits inhabit the plants and animals of the world, and the barbarians look to them for omens and power.

Other barbarians trust only in the blood that runs in their veins and the steel they hold in their hands. They have no use for the invisible world, instead relying on their senses to hunt and survive like the wild beasts they emulate.

Both of these attitudes can give rise to superstitions. These beliefs are often passed down within a family or shared among the members of a clan or a hunting group.

If your barbarian character has any superstitions, were they ingrained in you by your family, or are they the result of personal experience?

Superstition:
d6 | Superstition
1 | If you disturb the bones of the dead, you inherit all the troubles that plagued them in life.
2 | Never trust a wizard. They're all devils in disguise, especially the friendly ones.
3 | Dwarves have lost their spirits, and are almost like the undead. That's why they live underground.
4 | Magical things bring trouble. Never sleep with a magic object within ten feet of you.
5 | When you walk through a graveyard, be sure to wear silver, or a ghost might jump into your body.
6 | If an elf looks you in the eyes, she's trying to read your thoughts.</text>

        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose barbarian as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a barbarian.

	• Strength 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a barbarian.

	• Armor: shields
	• Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons
	• Tools: none

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Multiclass Features</name>
        <text>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

Channel Divinity:
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

Extra Attack:
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does).
	Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Unarmored Defense:
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

Spellcasting:
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

Spells Known and Prepared:
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1 st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.
	Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spell casting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
	If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your character level, not your level in a particular class.

Spell Slots:
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
	If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.
	For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.

Pact Magic:
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

        <name>Rage</name>
        <text>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
	While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

	• You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

	• When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian. At 1st level, you have a +2 bonus to damage. Your bonus increases to +3 at 9th level and to +4 at 16th.

	• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
	Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
	Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.

        <name>Frenzy (Path of the Berserker)</name>
        <text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

Exhaustion:
Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.

Exhaustion Levels:
Level | Effect
1 | Disadvantage on ability checks
2 | Speed halved
3 | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
4 | Hit point maximum halved
5 | Speed reduced to 0
6 | Death

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.
	A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.
	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.
	Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1.

Tail. You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit and has the reach property.

6 | Until your rage ends, you are surrounded by multi colored, protective lights. You gain a +1 bonus to AC, and while within 10 feet of you, your allies gain the same bonus.
7 | Flowers and vines temporarily grow around you. Until your rage ends, the ground within 15 feet of you is difficult terrain for your enemies.
8 | A bolt of light shoots from your chest.

These barbarians forge powerful connections with the beasts and natural spirits of the world, inspiring such ethereal beings to manifest and journey with them on far-flung adventures.
	Barbarians who follow this path have a deep reverence for the ecological cycle of the natural world. Such barbarians are as likely to accept quests and pleas for aid from local wildlife as they are other humanoids.

You and your primal companion can communicate with one another telepathically while you are both on the same plane.
	As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your primal companion or summon it within 30 feet of you. In combat, your primal companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you use a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, your companion can take any action of its choice.

Drawing upon magic from the Shadowfell, these infiltrators breathe in sound and light and hold it within, suppressing it as they lay waste to enemies, doors, and any other barriers between them and their goal.
	In the world of Ravnica, House Dimir makes ample use of these barbarians. In the Forgotten Realms, the Zhentarim includes such ranks. Thieves' guilds, cults, or noble houses might also recruit these silent terrors as thieves or assassins.
	These powers are usually gained from dark rituals or curses. In either case, obtaining and using these powers is often painful, causing these barbarians to become part shadow and suffer—and make others suffer—in silence. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Infiltration Barbarian Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

Infiltration Barbarian Quirks:
1d6 | Quirk
1 | Your eyes are pitch black.
2 | You get headaches from bright light and loud noises.
3 | You often wake up screaming, but make no noise when you do.
4 | Your blood is black and quickly evaporates into shadowy mist.

6 | You rarely talk, preferring to write or gesture instead.

The metamorphosis lasts until you use this feature again or until you finish a long rest.
	If your transformation's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

Unstoppable Bulk. Your body becomes a mass of writhing flesh. While raging, you can use a bonus action to take the Dash action. If you end the dash next to a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you and take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier. 

Vile Presence. Your appearance becomes the stuff of nightmares, preventing enemies from escaping through sheer terror. While you're raging, you can use a reaction after hitting a creature to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 psychic damage and falls prone. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. A creature is also immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.

Tentacled Fury. You can transform your arms into powerful eldritch tentacles. While you are raging, you can use a bonus action to increase your reach with melee weapon attacks by 15 feet until the end of your turn. If you hit a target while using this feature, you can choose to drag the creature towards you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line toward you.

	You move in polite society as well as anyone else, and are possessed of a level of intellect unusual to other barbarians. Through careful study and alchemical experimentation, you have learned to tap into the primal beast inside you, and manifest it in physical ways.

Genius Bruisers:
Many alchemical formulae and path features described here make extensive use of Intelligence, an ability score not usually considered very important for barbarians.

	Whenever you enter a rage, you may expend a dose of one of your prepared alchemical formulae, granting you its effects for the duration of that rage. Your prepared alchemical formulae have no effect if used by creatures other than you, or if you attempt to administer them when not entering a rage, as they are tailored to your own unique body chemistry and psychology.
	Some formulae require creatures to make saving throws to resist their effects. The DC to resist a formula's effect is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

There are few who walk the Path of the Drag onheart, for it is one of unparalleled presence on the battlefield. A unique bond forged with dragonkind fuels each dragonheart's rage, endowing these warriors with increased stamina and fortitude, as well as the ability to channel destructive energy through their weapons. The most stalwart dragonhearts even learn to share aspects of their bond with others.
	The exact nature of these barbarians is shrouded in mystery. Some sources say that these men and women gain their abilities by slaying a dragon and eating its heart. Others claim that a dragon can share its strength with a worthy soul through a deep, spiritual bond. Still, more argue that the heart of a dragon literally beats in the chest of the warrior who follows this path.
	At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Becoming a Dragonheart table to determine the nature of your character's bond.

Becoming a Dragonheart:
d6 I became a dragonheart because...
1 | I was fatally wounded, but for some reason, a dragon took mercy on me and saved my life.
2 | The rite to become a dragonheart has been passed down in my tribe for centuries.
3 | Knowing the power it would bring, I killed a helpless dragon and took its heart.
4 | I saved a dragon's eggs and it blessed me for my deeds.
5 | Seeking to have a greater influence in the world, a dragon chose me as its proxy.

        <text>As in all civilizations, stories of life's origin are intertwined with the path of mythical beings consorting among them out of grand purpose or boredom. These stories, told since the first sunrise, act as guiding parables when a tribe or people faces a crucial juncture in their fate. They tell of times of great peril, when a powerful individual emerges from their number, led by a forbear's spirit, to lead them to their destiny—for good or ill. The circumstances surrounding the event could be as simple as the death of a clan's chieftain, as great as the threat of slavery, or even extinction.
	With most tribes, the elders are aware of a spirit's affinity to their people but other times they are just as surprised by the mark themselves. When the gift manifests itself it is easily recognized often celebrated. There are instances, however, when it is perceived as an omen.

Cantrips:
You learn three cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Sacred Kin Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell feather fall and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast feather fall with either slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
You know three 1st-level sorcerer spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the divination or transmutation spells on the sorcerer spell list.
	The Spells Known column of the Sacred Kin Spellcasting table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be a divination or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
	The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic on the sorcerer's spell list.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the sorcerer spells you know with another spell of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a divination or transmutation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.

Spellcasting Ability:
Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to harness the magic in your blood. You use your Constitution whenever a spell refers to your spell casting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast or when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

	• You have advantage on Constitution checks and saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell.

	• You have resistance to damage from spells and other magical effects.

Your Supernatural Fury lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you're knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature, cast a spell, or taken damage since your last turn. You can end your Supernatural Fury on your turn as a bonus action.

The barbarians that follow this path fuel their rage with this pursuit of purpose. For those that live long enough, their discipline becomes almost monk-like in its meditation, chasing their sense of self through the arteries of those they deem worthy in battle.
	As wizards live to slake their thirst for knowledge, barbarians who follow the Path of Red Reaver are usually drawn to the greatest challenge in the field, not for bragging rights, or even to turn the tide of battle, but to further discern their place in the veins of their world.

When you're raging and below half of your hit point maximum, at the start of your turn you can enter a devouring rage by expending any number of Hit Dice as a bonus action. For the duration of your rage, your weapons become magical for the purpose of overcoming damage resistances and immunities, and on a hit, you regain a number of hit points equal to 1 plus the number of Hit Dice you spent. On a critical hit, you restore twice that amount of hit points.
	Your target must have blood in order for you to regain hit points from an attack.
	At the beginning of each turn, if you haven't hit a hostile creature since your last turn, you suffer damage equal to the number you would regain on a hit but retain your devouring rage and its features.

	If you know the creature you're looking for and have access to one of its possessions, you can focus solely on that target. While focused, you can't use this feature to detect any other creature but your quarry. When you would make a Wisdom (Survival) check to track your quarry, the creature instead makes a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. On a failure, you learn the direction and approximate distance to that creature, and are able to follow its scent even through terrain that would normally cover its scent, like running water.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses. You must be able to breathe in order to use this feature.

        <text>A Lightning Vessel is a brute, a monster of battle. Their bodies overflowing with lightning, they arrive unexpectedly, often dropping from buildings or leaping impossible distances, before crashing down amidst the fight. The presence of a single Lightning Vessel is often enough to turn the tides of battle. Their ferocious electricity rampaging through their enemies, leaving a trail of charred corpses in their wake. If one ends up face to face against such a monster, there is no running away—they will catch you, electrocute you, and rend your corpse. Although vital in the fight against the Scourge, their recklessness causes fear in the heart of friends and foes alike.
	The Scions created the Lightning Vessels, using galvanized rods implanted within the spine of newborns, before subjecting them to violent shock therapy. Of those children, a few grew capable of harnessing lightning, while many more were crippled for life—a small price to pay for salvation. This very technology was later used to create the Galvanized Prowlers, mortal enemies of the Lightning Vessels, as the Scions started fearing their own creation.

        <text>Lightning is part of you. It flows through your veins and awaits release. At 3rd level, you gain resistance to lightning damage. If you already have this resistance, instead, if you take lightning damage, you can reduce that damage by 1d6 (after the resistance applies).
	In addition, while raging, you can unleash the lightning within. For the duration of your rage, you can use your bonus action to unleash various powers.

Saving Throws. Some of your abilities require your target to make a saving throw to resist the effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

	Vessel save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

	• Electrified Chains. You can use your bonus action to create chains of lightning that wrap around your weapon. The next time you hit a creature this turn, it takes additional lightning damage equal to twice your Constitution modifier and becomes ensnared by the chains, which anchor to the floor, until the start of your next turn. Each time it attempts to move more than 10 feet while ensnared, it must make an Athletics check contested by your Athletics check, freeing itself on a success. On a failure, it takes the lightning damage again and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.

	• Fulgurant Strike. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can leave the weapon embedded in their chest for a brief moment and immediately use a bonus action to call down lightning from the heavens to strike them, using the weapon as a conduit, before retrieving it. The target takes lightning damage equal to twice your Constitution modifier, and all creatures within a 5-foot radius must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Vessel save DC or also take that damage. You have advantage on this saving throw.

	• Lightning Step. As a bonus action, you can move up to half your speed. During this rush, your body becomes supercharged; if you end this movement within 5 feet of a creature, it takes lightning damage equal to twice your Constitution modifier as the lightning leaps to them. If there are multiple creatures, choose one that takes the damage.

	All creatures in a 10-foot radius centered on that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Vessel save DC or take a number of d8s of lightning damage equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1d8), or half as much damage on a success.
	If a creature is in the space on which you land, they have disadvantage on the saving throw and are pushed 5 feet out of your space into an unoccupied space of their choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone in your space.

        <text>In a time long past, the power to command gravity was stolen and disseminated throughout the destitute underbelly of Luyarnha, much like the mythical theft of fire from the heavens. Within the ranks of the Forsaken, many have embraced the spatial magic as a tool of mass destruction, unleashing it upon beasts and mortals with a ruthlessness particular to those who have nothing to lose. Among them, the Earthbreakers stand imperious; barbarians with a natural affinity for the void, capable of leveling buildings in their rage, these living titans are coveted prizes. Many factions seek to bend their wills for their own ends, and if such control proves impossible, death is an all too frequent outcome.
	Whether from innate talent, intense training, or cursed rituals, all Earthbreakers share the same path of destruction, crushing their foes and grinding them to dust. Earthbreakers thrive in the middle of the battlefield, where they break their enemies, drag their face on the pavement, and leave behind naught but a mess of blood and brain. It is pointless to hide from them, for they are capable of shattering the very foundations of the world to unearth their quarry. The power to reshape the world—to bend and break it at a whim—is one many desire, yet few master it like Earthbreakers do.

In addition, the range of thrown weapons is doubled for you. If you hit with a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, you can use the damage die above in place of the weapon's usual damage dice.

	• Bulldozing Punch. You push the target 10 feet away from you or upward. If pushed into an obstacle or another creature, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of 1). Creatures with a Strength score equal to or greater than yours can make a Strength saving throw to resist this effect, avoiding it on a success. If you push the target upward, it can make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, avoiding any fall damage on a success.

Each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from you. If this pushes the attacker beyond its reach of you, the attack misses you. If the bubble doesn't burst by the start of your next turn, it harmlessly dissipates.

	• Stomp. You stomp the ground, causing a destructive quake in a 10-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line on the ground originating from you.

        <text>The Path of the Brutal Hunter is a barbaric tradition that holds to the notion that in the grand scheme of things, all beings are either hunters or prey. Those who embrace this path aim to become the ultimate predator, stalking and taking down the most formidable quarry they can find. The rite of passage for these barbarians involves solo hunting expeditions, where they must bring down the most powerful creature they can find. This rite is highly regarded within their tribes and serves as a way to prove one's worth, attain prestige, or face shame.
	Fueled by a burning desire to demonstrate their strength to themselves, their tribe, or their enemies, the Brutal Hunters relentlessly pursue their targets with unyielding fervor. They may hunt for revenge against those who have wronged them, eliminate enemies, or prove their dominance over powerful creatures, making them trophies to add to their collection.
	Brutal Hunters take immense pride in their hunting trophies, viewing them as a symbol of their strength and prowess. Their collection of teeth from their fallen prey is a source of great respect among their peers and serves as a testament to their power. They are never content to rest on their laurels and are always seeking out greater challenges and more powerful prey, driven by a thirst to prove themselves and secure their place at the top of the food chain.

It takes a truly exceptional individual to survive in this realm of darkness, and the penumbral barbarians are such a breed. These barbarians have honed their skills through constant conflict and challenges and are composed of the strongest, the bravest, and sometimes even the most reckless outcasts.
	The trials of life in the Penumbral Plane have given rise to a new path, one of unparalleled combative prowess. These barbarians undergo grueling physical and mental training to become masters of survival and combat, and many of the gloomfolks tribesmen aspire to join this path. By continuously hunting and feeding on the power of the fearsome penumbral creatures they become resistant to the Penumbral Plane's dangerous effects. These warriors wield weapons imbued with nightmarish power, striking fear into the hearts of their enemies.
	In addition to their combat prowess, penumbral barbarians are highly skilled navigators of the treacherous terrain of the Penumbral Plane. They possess great knowledge about the flora and fauna of the penumbra, as well as its many complex layers, using this expertise to gain an advantage in both survival and battle.
	The penumbral barbarians are a proud people, often sharing their incredible stories of survival and bravery with those who dare to enter their domain. These tales, recounted with conviction, combined with the warriors' fearsome reputation, leave a lasting impression on all who encounter them. The authenticity of these stories may be called into question, but the penumbral barbarians' unwavering spirit and bravery is undeniable.

Even if you are not playing in Tanares, the use of this sub class is not only possible but also straightforward. Simply adapt any mention of the Penumbral Plane to any similar dark or astral environments that you can treat as shadow, a good example being the Shadowfell.

A rare few wrestle the madness of the Haze through a supernatural rage which allows them to channel the eldritch energies of delerium. These Haze Ragers thrive on the contaminated power of delerium, transforming madness and fear into a weapon. Their practice has given them unnatural tolerance for contamination, and some have told legends of these barbarians surviving even the most horrific mutations.

The barbarians of the Path of Heavy Metal do not do things by halves. They fight the strongest foes, swing the biggest axes, and play the loudest music. For this reason, any battle they get involved in tends to be noisy, violent, and short.
	Armored only in face paint and studded belts, these fearless hellions are known for screaming their enemies into submission and trashing taverns, though they can also be thoughtful and erudite when not tapping into their primal fury. Away from the battlefield, the "thunderheads" form a tight fraternity, bonded together by absolute commitment to their path and the shared recognition that the life of an adventurer—with its grueling travel, explosive violence, and unfamiliar lodgings—is essentially a never-ending tour.

The colossus, sometimes known as a war-hulk, is a barbarian of the front lines, hefting massive weapons and sweeping away smaller combatants in their fury. To a war-hulk, strength is the only attribute that matters. Cunning is for the weak; faith is for the weak; speed is for the weak. Victory is for the strong alone, and rage is the purest path to strength. This path is a favorite of goliaths and giants, who step easily into crushing smaller opponents.

Size:
While the Path of the Colossus can be taken by members of any race, the GM can limit access to this path to races of appropriate size. Gnomes and halflings, for example, are poorly suited to throwing boulders, whereas goliaths and minotaurs are well suited to the task.

This size increase doesn't stack with similar size increases, such as from the enlarge/reduce spell. If there isn't enough room for you to double your size, you attain the maximum possible size in the space available. Your weapons also grow to match your new size.

Tribal communities exist all across the realms, in all manner of locales and climes. While their customs often change, one steadfast certainty seen time and time again is the reverence for particular animals local to that tribe. These are often wildly varied;
northern tribes may revere the Wolf or the Bear, those of the deserts follow the Hawk or the Jackal, and those of the jungle may aspire to the Ape or the Tiger. It is in this tradition that the Path of the Fin, island warriors capturing the bloodthirsty essence of the great Shark, arose.

Spell Slots. The Rage Mage Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level or higher. To cast one of these spells, you must be raging and expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You know three 1st-level sorcerer spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the evocation or transmutation spells on the sorcerer spell list.
	The Spells Known column of the Rage Mage Spellcasting table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
	The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the sorcerer spells you know with another spell of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation or transmutation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

        <text>An Extension of the Path of the Totem Warrior for the Barbarian Class.

Some warriors choose to take on the deep, spiritual journey of connecting with the natural creatures of the realm, letting the ancestral knowledge of their chosen totem spirit to guide them through their worldly trials. This broad array of noble beasts eagerly bestow their ancient lessons unto the barbarian who binds their strength to their animalistic essence.
	Others instead discover the impossibly powerful majesty of the duck, eschewing the influence of inferior inspirations and instead devoting their strength and attention to these incredible beaked sentinels of ponds across the realms, in return being granted supernatural skill and ability in the image of their feathered patrons.
	Others still may just be ducks themselves turned into people.
	Regardless of the journey that has led a rage-fueled engine of destruction to discover the endless might and wisdom of these billed beasts that protect the planes, the rewards that lay in wait for those who prove their tenacity and will to their quacking masters shall be remembered as guardians of legend, flapping forces of nature whose deeds carve a bloody (and quite loud) path of glory through the ages to come.
	Inspired by the creative inquiries of actor Jon Heder in the development of the majestic Half-Orc Barbarian Lionel Gayheart, you, too, can now harness this unstoppable source of power.

You must make or acquire a physical totem object an amulet or similar adornment that incorporates feathers. bones, iconography, or crude, cartoonish drawings of a duck. At your option, you also gain minor physical or mental attributes that are reminiscent of a duck. For example. you may develop feathers in certain areas of your body that require consistent grooming, or subconsciously quack to yourself when confused or met with an unnerving sound.
	Your totem animal might be an animal related to a duck, though more appropriate to your homeland, but let's be honest... It's a duck. Why else would you be reading this?

Duck. While raging, when an attacker that you can see targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, helping you to shrug off the blow. Like water of a duck's back.

        <text>You have studied martial techniques to enhance your ability on the fields of battle. You gain the features below:

Maneuvers. You learn two Maneuvers of your choice from the list at the end of this Primal Path. You can use only one Maneuver per attack. When you gain a level, you can replace one Maneuver you know with another Manuever of your choice.

Superiority Dice. You have three Superiority Dice, which are d6s. You must expend one of your Superiority Dice to use one of the Maneuvers you know, and you regain all expended Superiority Dice when you finish a short or long rest.

Saving Throws. Some of your Maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the Maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

	Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

Maneuvers. Here's the list of Maneuvers you consult each time you learn a new Maneuver. The Maneuvers below are either from the Player's Handbook of Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*. You can add these through the Maneuvers spell list.

Ambush*

        <text>When you adopt this Primal Path, you learn to channel the primal power of spirits to cast spells, much like a Shaman.

Cantrips:
You learn one cantrip of your choice from the Warden spell list. Upon reaching 10th level in this class you learn one additional Warden cantrip of your choice.

Spell Slots:
The Warden Primal Magic table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of those spell slots. All of your spell slots from this feature are the same level. To cast one of the Warden spells you know of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all of your expended spell slots each time you finish a short or long rest.
	For example, when you are 7th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and cast it as a 2nd-level spell.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:
You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warden spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warden Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warden spells of 1st-level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.
	When you gain a level, you can choose a warden spell you know and replace it with another spell from the warden spell list, which must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
	When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn a new Warden spell of your choice, which can be 1st or 2nd-level.

Spellcasting Ability:
As you draw your magic from your connection to primal spirits, Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your warden spells. You use Wisdom when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC for a spell, or when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Tundra. The air around you coldly slows your foes. The area within your aura is difficult terrain for your enemies.

        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Zealot (UA)</name>
        <text>Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are zealots—warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power.
	A variety of gods across the worlds of D&amp;D inspire their followers to embrace this path. Tempus from the Forgotten Realms and Hextor and Erythnul of Greyhawk are all prime examples. In general, the gods who inspire zealots are deities of combat, destruction, and violence. Not all are evil, but few are good.

        <text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can channel divine fury when you start to rage. If you do so, you become cloaked in an aura of divine power until the rage ends. At the end of each of your turns for that duration, each creature within 5 feet of you takes damage equal to 1d6 + half your barbarian level. The damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature.

        <text>At 6th level, the divine power that fuels your rage can shield you from harm. If you fail a saving throw while raging, you can instead succeed on that saving throw as a reaction. However, doing so immediately ends your rage, and you can't rage again until you finish a short or long rest.

You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until your rage ends.

Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell. You faintly glow a color corresponding to the school of magic you detect (you choose the colors).

        <name>Wild Surge (Path of the Wild Soul (UA))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, magic erupts from you as you rage. When you enter your rage, roll on the Wild Surge table to determine the magical effect produced.
	If the wild surge requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

Wild Surge:
d8 | Effect
1 | Necrotic energy bursts from you. Each creature within 30 feet of you takes 1d10 necrotic damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the sum of the necrotic damage dealt to the creatures.
2 | You teleport up to 20 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Until your rage ends, you can activate this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action.
3 | You conjure 1d4 intangible spirits that look like flumph in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of you. Each spirit immediately flies 30 feet in a random direction. At the end of your turn, all spirits explode and each creature within 5 feet of one or more of them must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 force damage.
4 | Arcane energy enshrouds you. Until your rage ends, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, and whenever a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack, that creature takes force damage equal to your Constitution modifier.
5 | Plant life temporarily grows around you: until your rage ends, the ground within 10 feet of you is difficult terrain.
6 | Arcane energy taps into the minds of those around you. Each creature within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or you see a glimpse of the creature's thoughts, learning how it plans to attack you. As a result, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.
7 | Shadows weave around a weapon of your choice you are holding. Until your rage ends, your weapon deals psychic damage instead of its bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage, and it gains the light and thrown properties with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If you drop the weapon or throw it, the weapon dissipates and reappears in your hand at the end of your turn.
8 | A beam of brilliant light lances from your chest in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 radiant damage and be blinded until the start of your next turn.

The creature recovers an expended spell slot of a level equal to the number rolled. If the creature you touch can't recover a spell slot of that level, the creature instead gains temporary hit points equal to five times the number rolled.
	You take force damage equal to five times the number rolled.
	When you reach 14th level in this class, you increase the die to a d6.

	Those who tread this path might be inhabited by a primal spirit or descended from shapeshifters. You can choose the origin of your feral might or determine it randomly by rolling on the Origin of the Beast table.

Origin of the Beast:
d4 | Origin
1 | One of your parents is a lycanthrope, and you've inherited some of the curse.
2 | You are descended from a legendary druid, a fact manifested by your ability to partially change shape.
3 | A fey spirit gifted you with the ability to adopt different bestial aspects.
4 | An ancient animal spirit dwells within you, allowing you to walk this path.

Bite. Your mouth transforms into a bestial snout or great mandibles (your choice). Your bite deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with your bite, you regain a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).

Claws. Your hands transform into claws, which deal 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. When you take the Attack action on your turn and make an attack with your claws, you can make one additional attack using your claws as part of the same action.

Tail. You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals 1d12 piercing damage on a hit and has the reach property.
