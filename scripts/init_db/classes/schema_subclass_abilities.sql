You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow fires forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage. The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class. Seeking Arrow. Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out your target, allowing the arrow to curve and twist its path in search of its prey. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute.

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don’t learn its location. The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class. Shadow Arrow. You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe’s vision with shadows.

Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a time. The following runes are available to you when you learn a rune. If a rune has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the rune.

Frost Rune. This rune''''s magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such as frost giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks. In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or Constitution.

Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage.

If the arrow hits the target, the target can''''t attack the chosen ally or include that ally in a harmful area of effect until the end of your next turn.

A creature hit by this arrow suffers disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of your next turn. Grasping Arrow. When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, thorny brambles that wrap around the target. The target hit by the arrow takes a –10 penalty to speed, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage if it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can touch it can use its action to try to remove the brambles, which requires a successful DC 10 Strength check. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute.

When you attack with this arrow, it fires forward in a line that is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long. You make a separate attack using your Arcane Arrow against each creature in that line. Seeking Arrow.

As an action, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute, and make a ranged attack against it, using the Arcane Arrow.

When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see the ""Arcane Shot Options"" section below). Once per turn when you fire a magic arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits, unless the option doesn''''t involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest. You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.'),

(84, 'Ever-Ready Shot', 15, 'Starting at 15th level, your magical archery is ever available to you when you need it most. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot remaining, you regain one use of it.'),
(84, 'Arcane Shot Options', 18, 'The Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. They are all magical effects, and each one is associated with one of the schools of magic. If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Banishing Arrow. You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild. If the arrow hits a creature, the target must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, its speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 2d6 force damage when the arrow hits it. Brute Bane Arrow. You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. If the arrow hits a creature, the target takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the damage of the target''''s attacks is halved until the start of your next turn. The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class. Bursting Arrow. You imbue your arrow with a blast of force energy drawn from the school of evocation. If the arrow hits a creature, the target and each creature within 10 feet of it also take2d6 force damage each. The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class. Grasping Arrow. When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. If the arrow hits a creature, the target takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again. The poison and slashing damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class. Mind-Scrambling Arrow. Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. Choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. If the arrow hits a creature, the target takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it can''''t attack the chosen ally or include that ally in a harmful area of effect until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally deals any damage to the target. The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class. Piercing Arrow. You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don''''t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow fires forward in a line that is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage. The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class. Seeking Arrow. Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out your target, allowing the arrow to curve and twist its path in search of its prey. When you use this option, you don''''t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon''''s range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target''''s current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don''''t learn its location. The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class. Shadow Arrow. You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe''''s vision with shadows. If the arrow hits a creature, the target takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn. The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class');
