The Harpers. Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harpers'' ideals.

The Order of the Gauntlet. One of the newest power groups in Faerûn, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order''s ideals, and the clergy of the order''s patron gods.

The Emerald Enclave. Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods of nature.

The Lords'' Alliance. On one level, the agents of the Lords'' Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance''s ideals.

The Zhentarim. In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren''t necessarily criminal in nature.

The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this background.

Evermeet. The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerûn. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your homeland.
	Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerûn for a purpose that benefits elven culture or society.

Halruaa. Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerûn who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can work magic.
	Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerûn for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa''s many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods of magic.

Kara-Tur. The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerûn, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faerûn likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn''t your true ethnicity, because that''s the blanket term they use for everyone who shares your origin.
	The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerûn as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission was over.

Mulhorand. From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is a lien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerûn. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts of Faerûn.
	Those who leave behind Mulhorand''s sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of your home.

Sossal. Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed in white.
	Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly important.

Zakhara. As the saying goes among those in Faerûn who know of the place, "To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more." Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn''t unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faerûn for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as you have.
	You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your own deities.

The Underdark. Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you were a child.
	If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren''t a native, your reason for leaving "home" probably has something to do with getting away from a bad situation.');

The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faerûn has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities.
Though the term "knight" conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faerûn don''t restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren''t limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order''s cause.

	This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.');

Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faerûn who hear the word "knight" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations.

Knights of the Unicorn. The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriarch families in Baldur''s Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue''s tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their weaknesses.

Knights of Myth Drannor. Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falcon hand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they''ve begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant and honest.

Knights of the Silver Chalice.The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe''s ethos is the nobility''s right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to the crown.');

The Chill. he cold and mysterious Lurkwood serves as the home of numerous groups of goblinoids that have banded together into one tribe called the Chill. Unlike most of their kind, the Chill refrains from raiding the people of the North and maintains relatively good relations so that they can hire themselves out as warriors.

Silent Rain. Consisting solely of elves, Silent Rain is a legendary mercenary company operating out of Evereska. Caring little for gold or fame, Silent Rain agrees only to jobs that either promote elven causes or involve destroying orcs, gnolls, and the like.

The Bloodaxes. Founded in Sundabar nearly two centuries ago, the Bloodaxes were originally a group of dwarves outcast from their clans for crimes against the teachings of Moradin Soulforger.

Those words still haunt your dreams at night. When everyone was fleeing Phlan, you choose to stay. Whether out of an emotional attachment, or pursuit of riches, you made the decision that would affect the rest of your life.
Food became scarcer for those without connections. You became a beggar and to stay alive you bartered information to any interested party with food or gold to spare. You were good at what you did, and thought you were invincible. That changed when you were captured by the Tears of Virulence, the soldiers of Vorgansharax, the Maimed Virulence, for selling secrets to those bent on overthrowing the dragon. They locked you in the cells of Stojanow Gate. The first weeks you hoped to stay alive. As the weeks turned into months, and the interrogations continued you began to pray for death.

The dragon cultists came to the hills one day — magic-users wearing purple and riding horrid beasts, black-clad warriors wearing wicked masks, and even soldiers from the nearby town of Phlan. Then the dragon called Vorgansharax arrived and laired in the hills, causing horrid thickets to grow and animals to act unusually. The cultists began raiding nomad camps for victims to offer to the wyrm. Eventually, the dragon moved on to attack Phlan, but life was never again the same for the nomads of the Ticklebelly Hills.

That responsibility doesn''t mean you''re indispensable; your eventual death is part of your purpose and function, too, and you''ll be replaced even as your body provides nutrients to further the swarm''s growth.
	A classic adventuring role for a member of the Golgari involves crawling through dungeon-like environments—the sewers and ancient vaults of the undercity—in search of treasures left behind by the dead.

At other times, you could be asked to collect samples of a specific fungus, retrieve a body floating in the muck of the sewers, or bring back whatever booty you can to help fill the swarm''s coffers.
	You might gain enough renown to become a member of the Ochran, assigned to a variety of tasks concerning thievery, assassination, or the protection of important figures in your guild. You might steal something because the guild needs it, or because its loss will bring harm to another guild, hastening that group''s decline. You could be assigned to kill an outspoken and active enemy of the Golgari, such as an overzealous Boros captain whose raids into the undercity have approached dangerously close to the swarm''s inner sanctum. Or you could serve as a bodyguard to one of Guildmaster Jarad''s high chancellors, escorting this figure through the undercity while being ready to intervene at a moment''s notice if things go wrong.
	The shamans of the Golgari use their magic to accelerate the cycle of decay and regrowth. You might be sent to spread spores throughout an area that the Golgari want to claim as their territory or to convince the inhabitants of such a territory to abandon it.

Izzet Guild Spells:
Spell Level | Spells
Cantrip | produce flame, shocking grasp
1st | chaos bolt, create or destroy water, unseen servant
2nd | heat metal, rope trick
3rd | call lightning, elemental weapon, glyph of warding
4th | conjure minor elementals, divination, Otiluke''s resilient sphere
5th | animate objects, conjure elemental

Your spells tend to be loud, flashy, or explosive, even when the effect is unremarkable. For example, when you open the portal of a rope trick spell, the portal might be outlined by harmless, showy sparkles.
	If you use an arcane focus, it probably takes the form of an intricate device that could include metal gauntlets, glass canisters, copper tubing, and leather straps attaching it to your body. The mizzium apparatus described in chapter 5 is a magical version of this gear.
	The chaos bolt spell is a favorite of Izzet spellcasters because of its unpredictable nature.');

Fated Destinies:
Card | Heroic Tie
Balance | You were trained by an organization that opposes a deity or another powerful cosmic force.
Comet | You were born under a sign associated with cataclysm, and every attempt to glimpse your future reveals ill omens.
Donjon | A religious organization imprisoned you, perhaps because of a crime you committed against that faith or because the leaders considered you the servant of a rival power.
Euryale | You or your family are watched by secretive figures. They usually keep hidden, but you''ve seen they wear an unknown symbol.
Fates | You made a choice in your past that haunts you. Whatever the consequences, it''s not clear you made the right choice.
Flames | A powerful figure opposed to your beliefs vexes your life; even your triumphs seem to serve this being''s ends.
Fool | What could have been one of the happiest moments in your life turned into a tragedy.
Gem | You inherited land containing the ruins of a temple where a coveted relic was hidden.
Jester | You were brought up to believe in a prophecy of impending doom, but you perceive potential and hope where others expect disaster.
Key | An inflexible person with power over you threatened to bring about disaster, but your decisive action prevailed.
Knight | The defenders of a religious organization such as a druid circle, paladin order, or temple watch over you.
Moon | You are most comfortable at night, and all your greatest successes have taken place then. You also bear a silvery, crescent-shaped birthmark.
Puzzle | Your studies led you to a scrap of prophecy or the memoir of a prominent figure, which calls your beliefs into question.
Rogue | A devout individual whom you looked up to revealed themself to be false, a disciple of a power opposed to your beliefs.
Ruin | You were once a favored adherent of a religious order, but you''ve been cast out in disgrace.
Sage | An otherworldly being whispers advice to you in dreams or visitations, taking on different guises and speaking through others.
Skull | You were returned to life through resurrection magic, divine intervention, or a mysterious circumstance you don''t yet understand.
Star | When you adopted your current beliefs, your life changed dramatically for the better.
Sun | While you never placed much stock in the beliefs you were taught, adhering to them saved you from a catastrophe.
Talons | You have a well-used holy symbol from someone you looked up to, and you feel uncertain anytime you''re without it.
Throne | You were born to a family of divinely favored folk, and they have big expectations for you.
Void | Your soul, or a loved one''s, is doomed to be taken by a Fiend, a powerful Undead, or another wicked power.');

The entries are geared toward characters who rely on faith, conviction, or fate—particularly clerics, druids, and paladins—but any character''s story can benefit from them. When using this table, you can choose the entries that speak to you or randomly pull cards from The Deck of Many Things card set.
	The prompts can be personality traits, relationships, or events. Most are described as part of your character''s past, but they might foretell events in your character''s future. Consider how much your character knows about the destinies detailed in the table; these events might be a mystery to your character, shared only between you and your DM. Or perhaps your character learned about these events through omens or the readings of a fortune teller.

Fated Destinies:
Card | Heroic Tie
Balance | You were trained by an organization that opposes a deity or another powerful cosmic force.
Comet | You were born under a sign associated with cataclysm, and every attempt to glimpse your future reveals ill omens.
Donjon | A religious organization imprisoned you, perhaps because of a crime you committed against that faith or because the leaders considered you the servant of a rival power.
Euryale | You or your family are watched by secretive figures. They usually keep hidden, but you''ve seen they wear an unknown symbol.
Fates | You made a choice in your past that haunts you. Whatever the consequences, it''s not clear you made the right choice.
Flames | A powerful figure opposed to your beliefs vexes your life; even your triumphs seem to serve this being''s ends.
Fool | What could have been one of the happiest moments in your life turned into a tragedy.
Gem | You inherited land containing the ruins of a temple where a coveted relic was hidden.
Jester | You were brought up to believe in a prophecy of impending doom, but you perceive potential and hope where others expect disaster.
Key | An inflexible person with power over you threatened to bring about disaster, but your decisive action prevailed.
Knight | The defenders of a religious organization such as a druid circle, paladin order, or temple watch over you.
Moon | You are most comfortable at night, and all your greatest successes have taken place then. You also bear a silvery, crescent-shaped birthmark.
Puzzle | Your studies led you to a scrap of prophecy or the memoir of a prominent figure, which calls your beliefs into question.
Rogue | A devout individual whom you looked up to revealed themself to be false, a disciple of a power opposed to your beliefs.
Ruin | You were once a favored adherent of a religious order, but you''ve been cast out in disgrace.
Sage | An otherworldly being whispers advice to you in dreams or visitations, taking on different guises and speaking through others.
Skull | You were returned to life through resurrection magic, divine intervention, or a mysterious circumstance you don''t yet understand.
Star | When you adopted your current beliefs, your life changed dramatically for the better.
Sun | While you never placed much stock in the beliefs you were taught, adhering to them saved you from a catastrophe.
Talons | You have a well-used holy symbol from someone you looked up to, and you feel uncertain anytime you''re without it.
Throne | You were born to a family of divinely favored folk, and they have big expectations for you.
Void | Your soul, or a loved one''s, is doomed to be taken by a Fiend, a powerful Undead, or another wicked power.');

In exchange for protection, a modicum of kinship, and a number of useful resources to further develop your craft as a criminal, you agreed to receive the brand of the Clasp and join their ranks.
You might have spent time working the guild''s most menial assignments, wandering the alleys as a simple cutpurse and filling your pockets with silver while you waited to climb the professional ladder. Or you might be a clever actor and liar, whose skill at blending in with all facets of society has made you an indispensable spy. Perhaps your swift technique with a blade led you to become a feared assassin for the Spireling leader of a local Clasp sect. Regardless, though the threat of the law is ever looming, the advantages to having a connection to such a powerful cartel greatly outweighs your paranoia. Most of the time.
Since the Clasp is an organization, its members can rise in rank by proving their worth, by making the right friends in high places, or even through blackmail and bribery. You and the Game Master can decide together how your actions affect your rank in the Clasp, and what benefits that rank grants you.

This favor can take on any form subject to the approval of the GM, who decides how it is fulfilled.

If you''ve been imprisoned, Clasp operatives can look into breaking you out or paying off the jailer.
	At some point, the favor will be called in for repayment, often without warning. Refusing the call will result in your termination—literally. You might be called on to commit a specific burglary, or to pressure an Emonian dignitary to reveal a secret at an upcoming ball. The Clasp might even demand that you assassinate a specific person, with no questions asked or answered.

The Betrayers sought to wipe the slate clean.
At the end of that devastating war, the Prime Deities established a Divine Gate that would prevent all gods, good or evil, from directly affecting the world, but which would leave the gods'' mortal followers and supernal servants to enact their will. And so the corrupting whispers of the Betrayer Gods have ensnared the minds of power-hungry mortals for centuries, promising them a sliver of the gods'' great power in exchange for dedicating their souls to occult lore.
You once belonged to such a cult of the Betrayer Gods. Perhaps this faith only briefly tempted your rebellious, youthful spirit. Perhaps the cult gave you love and family when you had none, asking only your adherence to their prophet in exchange. Or maybe you were raised from birth to pay homage to gods of selfish cruelty—until one fateful day the veil was lifted, so that nothing stood between you and the horrifying truth.
However it happened, you were freed from the shackles of this poisonous sect. Yet you know that this group does not forgive betrayers. As long as you live, you will be hunted—and if the members of the cult think you dead, their hunt will begin again the second they learn they''re wrong.

Bandit Specialty:
d6 | Specialty
1 | Lookout
2 | Lifter
3 | Thug
4 | Runner
5 | Hustler
6 | Captain

Lookouts typically watch the roads for any signs of Perch Guard patrols, signalling the team to bail if a heist looks too risky. They also keep an eye out for potential marks.

Lifters are the specialist thieves of an operation. They are usually as adept at pick-pocketing as they are at sneaking up behind a cart to liberate its valuables.

Thugs are the muscle of a bandit group, and use their size and strength to intimidate merchants into giving up without a fight. They also keep other bandits in line, at the captain''s discretion.

Runners are the messengers and scouts of the Coalition, serving to smuggle pilfered goods to fences. Additionally, they pass information throughout the different camps of the organization. Their job often finds them working alone which makes them particularly vulnerable.

Hustlers are inveterate con-artists. Through careful planning and execution, their diversions can keep cart drivers occupied just long enough for the lifters to do their work, or create a seamless opening for an ambush.

Captains are the glue that holds each bandit team together, providing leadership, and stamping out dissention where necessary, often with force. They are figures that inspire with their skill and bravado.');

For while they cannot deny that the gods exist, they can deny that the gods are just—and can fight to prove that the dictates of an unjust god need not be obeyed. Some believe that one god (probably Bontu) has corrupted the process of the trials and the path to the afterlife. Others correctly intuit that the God-Pharaoh did not actually have the people''s best interests in mind when he ordered their society.
A character who is identified as a dissenter loses the benefit of the initiate''s or vizier''s background feature. In its place, the character gains the Shelter of Dissenters feature.

The five gods believe they were created by the God-Pharaoh, who charged them with teaching the people the ways of the God-Pharaoh, and with protecting them until he comes.
	The five gods embody the five virtues the God-Pharaoh wishes to cultivate in those who will become his Eternals in the afterlife. Each god is responsible for modeling and teaching one of those virtues to the acolytes and initiates of Naktamun, and then testing those initiates to ensure that they have mastered their teachings. Thus, they are present during the acolytes'' first lessons, during the Ceremony of Measuring, during the initiates'' intense training, and at each of the trials that are part of an initiate''s journey.
	In the absence of the God-Pharaoh, only the gods can determine whether initiates have proven themselves worthy of the glory of the afterlife.

You once carried a noble title, and your family still owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. Something in your past caused you to run from your family. Be it a banishment, voluntary exile to protect your family, or another reason, you no longer reap the rewards of your family''s name. If your family still holds status and your relationship with them is still favorable, perhaps they send you gifts in hopes that you return safely. Alternatively, perhaps you were forced into exile and your family has stripped everything from you, including your name and rank.
Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries or carried. A noble title doesn''t stand on its own—it''s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you. Also work out the details of your reason for running away, and the impact that may have on your family, your house, your country, or even the world itself.
Is your exile one that is barely spoken of and whispered only in rumors? Was your running away the talk of the town for weeks, fueling the gossip in taverns and inns? Was your banishment handled by the sovereign or by the head of your house? When you ran away, what state did you leave your house in? Is your family on the verge of collapse? Or are they even better off without you around?
What was your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? To what lengths will you go to restore your position? How does the head of your family feel about your absence?
Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family? If so, do you still wear them or shun your house and blame them for your predicament? How does your family feel about your use of their coat of arms, colors, or insignia? Are their punishments for using your family''s name and status without the proper authority?
These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.
